It went a long way.  We didn't get any other Al Qaeda attacks after 9/11 and they put all their focus on Iraq and attacking Europe.  After the surge, they weren't doing very well until a change in strategy came with the new Presidency.

Justification is different from ultimate success too.

""Hegemony"" from Merriam-Webster: influence or control over another country, a group of people, etc.


All war is about changing another country, or a group of people. It is one aspect of hegemony. Listing a number of wars and saying ""Hegemony"" is not informative. Expanding your statement would read:

""Why have we done so in Vietnam, Iraq, Panama, Haiti, Grenada, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, etc? Influence or control over another country, or a group of people.""


Now, your next sentence is ""this isn't new stuff"". Are you implying that the invasion of Afghanistan is driven by a historical impetus of spreading hegemony via military force? While literally correct, that the U.S. was using military force to  to influencing the country, or groups of people in that country, it does not take into account the motivations behind this particular instance of hegemony, which was preventing this country (Afghanistan) or group of people (the Taliban and Al-Queda) from additional direct attacks against the U.S.

Your original statement was part non-informative, and part reply baiting. Additionally when then ask for a constructive reply it is lazy, you are not putting out the time and effort on your part to present your arguments clearly and comprehensively, while asking the same from others.

cuxvfl4,0,t1_cuxn5u8,seanshawnshaun,"I gave a thought out reply to the user who gave one to me.

Now, look at the list of countries I gave you.  Almost none of them posed a threat to our national security, if we define ""security"" as ""physical security"" (disregarding the security of US business interests).  Yet we invaded those countries.  So no, I do not find it outlandish that we would invade ""uncivilized backwater"" for reasons unrelated to national security.  Instead, I think *one important reason* we invaded each of those countries, including Afghanistan, was to *maintain* hegemony.  A country starts to lose ""power and control over a group of people"" if it stops reminding that group of people who its boss is.

So I do think that there were other ways to achieve the ends of destroying a government and a terrorist organization without [killing more than 26,000 civilians in the process](http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/afghan).  That's about 7 9/11's worth of civilian deaths for which *we*, as taxpayers in the US, share responsibility.  But hey, at least we prevented future 9/11s from happening, right?

edit- I know that my last paragraph has nothing to do with the motives of the US govt in the war.  I am not pretending to know exactly why the govt does what it does, invades who it invades, etc.  It's difficult for anyone to know these things because its all classified for our own good, right?  I just wanted to express some views that are not usually highly discussed in the mainstream.  Returning to the original question of the thread, I don't think the war was justified due to the civilian death count (other options should have been explored before war).  And I would find it incredibly hard to believe that Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld were thinking solely about preventing future terrorist attacks when they decided to invade.  That's all.

cuwwv3k,0,t1_cuww46q,Tsuruta64,"Oh that is true. Hegemony, of course. But this is not a reason, this is not a why. Hegemony, its very nature, is a means, it is not an end. So, to establish hegemony by invading Afghanistan is to be looking for a means to do... what?

",5,0,1441904167,1444730857
cux5y3v,0,t1_cuwwv3k,seanshawnshaun,"Hegemony isn't solely a means, I think, in that the one with power and dominance over another, in any situation, will tend to get its way.  So, for the US, maintaining that position of power over other countries allows us a large amount of leverage in, well, pretty much anything.  Iraq and Afghanistan were invaded, I think, to a large extent because their governments, Saddam and the Taliban, posed a threat to US hegemony in the region simply because they did not like us and did not want to work with us. Add in the fact that they are located in a very geopolitically important region, and you get the invasions.

Obviously, the case can be made that the Taliban posed a grave risk to national security, and that Al-Qaeda needed to be destroyed.  However, when I step back and look at the [civilian casualties of the Afghan invasion](http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/afghan), I just don't see it as a justified war.  We killed about 9 times as many Afghani civilians since the invasion than we lost on 9/11, and that,  to me, seems like a very high cost to destroy a terrorist organization.

It seems to me that the Bush administration wasted no time in exploiting the national horror at the 9/11 atrocities to achieve its own goals, namely, showing the countries in the Middle East that they did not like that the US is still the boss.
