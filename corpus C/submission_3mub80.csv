3mub80,Should graphic imagery be used in the abortion debate?,74,rosechaltry,"I am a pro-choice moderate liberal who had an abortion 5 years ago. All of the recent videos attacking Planned Parenthood did not effect me and only pushed me toward support for PP, but I just watch the video that Carly Fiornia referenced in the GOP debate and I nearly lost my lunch. I don't think that something like this should be allowed in the discussion.
