It is impossible to enter the market because of the limited business practices allowed due to regulations necessitate an economy of scale to compete.

Despite every market being dominated by an oligopoly, taxes mitigate their profits, and wealth is redistributed.  Money is appropriated to conduct research, produce art, or fund programs to benefit politically accepted goals.  For instance, there are funds that support minority artists, or grants for female novelists.  Broad controls on media exist and are enforced in order to mitigate socially unacceptable discussion.  For most topics there is one narrative and departure is censored or ostracized.

The country exists in a period of low economic growth, but a uniform lower-middle class standard of living keeps everyone healthy and happy.  Administrative costs of healthcare are down reducing the net cost of healthcare, but unreliable supply and increase in demand due to a single payer system results in long waiting times and limited treatment options.  Elective treatments, or treatments not sanctioned by the state healthcare system are all but unaffordable.

At some point the military is heavily scaled back, and America all but loses its global hegemony.  There is a possibility for global-scale conflict.  As Africa becomes an economic powerhouse, American politicians argue for trade restrictions, further stymying economic growth.  The rest of the world outpaces America in economic growth.  People (especially skilled and educated classes) emigrate to countries where they have a greater opportunity.

The rules that are created are designed to incentivize local community and civic involvement and engagement.  

The rules that are created don't allow for worker exploitation or human slavery or servitude because labor is now on an equal footing with capital.  There is give and take between the two, but neither side fully controls the narrative.

People who try to take advantage of others for personal gain, or who try to take more than their fair share become culturally looked down upon in the way that ""moochers"" and ""welfare queens"" are currently stigmatized and looked down upon.

With weak IP law, you will certainly see even more of your R&D talent leave (and presumably some arts/media as well, since copyright law would also be weaker).  Nobody will want to hire scientists or engineers in a country where the better option is to just rip off the competition, so now they basically have to leave, except for the few who get hired to reverse-engineer the work of better nations.  I guess as long as you don't mind lagging behind other countries technologically by a decade or so, you might feel okay with this (even reverse engineering takes time, as you have to not only figure out the product, but how it is made, and then actually build a factory that can make it).  

The other trouble is that pretty much all developed nations are bound by a number of international treaties regarding respect of patent law.  Developing countries that signed have more leeway in this regard (and yes, China is officially considered ""developing"" still), but a developed nation would certainly face severe international backlash for disregarding intellectual property, probably resulting in retaliatory trade barriers to your nation.   There's no way other nations will let this go without response.  Technology that's harder to reverse engineer would become especially scarce in your country.  

I'm not sure how this nation has a happy ending.  By losing researchers, becoming more isolated, and relying increasingly on violating IP instead of doing its own R&D, it's like a reverse of how developing nations become developed.

Again, some will leave, but many more will stay.  There are a lot of talented people that don't want to leave the place they were born.  Just because some leave doesn't mean that *everyone* will.  

As for ""better nations"" I'm sure the fact that our nation is able to get affordable drugs while the country Pfiser emigrated to has outrageously expensive drugs that most of the citizens can't afford.  I'd still rather be living here.

Is that why other countries have more reliable and faster internet than we do?  

>The other trouble is that pretty much all developed nations are bound by a number of international treaties regarding respect of patent law.

You are correct about this - but, I mean, we are talking about a hypothetical utopian leftist state here, so...I guess for my purposes this new hypothetical state would be happy to consider itself ""developing"" if the more ""developed"" countries would turn a blind eye to our copying their tech.  

> By losing researchers, becoming more isolated, and relying increasingly on violating IP instead of doing its own R&D, it's like a reverse of how developing nations become developed.

I would imagine losing a few researchers, so that whatever area they move to plays some Israel like role in the world as far as R&D.  We wouldn't lose enough to make a difference.  At worst, we become what England or France is to the USA.  So you can't get a Renault in the US, big whoop.
