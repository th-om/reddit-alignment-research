3mxtoo,"Why tax anybody that makes less than $100,000?",64,kirkisartist,"I think the income inequality gives the federal govt an opportunity to have the best of both worlds. No fussing around with taxing the middle and upper middle class income. Just stick to taxing the people that can easily afford it.

I think we can all live on $100,000 a year. That first $100,000 will go untaxed. There would be a perpetual 1% tax increase on every $10,000 over $100,000 and max out at 50%. The only problem is diminishing returns once you hit the Laffer curve. So once it goes over 25% charity deductions apply to keep it there.

All of us plebs making less than $100,000 a year still have our states to deal with. That means property and sales tax is business as usual.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mxtoo/why_tax_anybody_that_makes_less_than_100000/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443598049,1444721778
