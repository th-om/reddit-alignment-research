Airbursts - nuclear weapon detonations in the air - produce little fallout.

This dust ""falls out"" over time and can be a radiation problem.

If an enemy wants to destroy cities, they will use airbursts. This spreads out the blast effect over as wide an area as possible. If an enemy wants to destroy fortified targets like missile silos, they will use ground bursts so more energy gets dumped onto the small target.

So, as I understand it, a *limited* nuclear war that only involved nuclear bombing of cities wouldn't cause so much fallout as to make the countries involved uninhabitable.

Really, the only areas that will receive massive fallout will be downwind of ICBM fields.

Industrial targets would typically be airbursts, they would explode high up and the concussive force would reach out to knock the target down.

>we can instead have kinetic-bombardment weapons able to cause terrible effects to cities

You seem to be starting from the assumption that the purpose of nuclear weapons is to destroy cities, so ""why not just drop rocks on cities""?  That is not the purpose of nuclear weapons.

The purpose is to carry out a strategic bombing campaign over the course of a week or so.  That's it.  All stop.  At no point has an American(or Russian, or very likely Chinese) nuclear planner said ""okay let's destroy cities"".  It's always been ""we need to destroy this factory and we need this type of bomb to do so.""  Sucks to be you if you're nearby, but the goal isn't to kill as many people as possible.

>but would leave the earth habitable after the war.

The Earth would have been habitable after a nuclear war.  It would have been the most cataclysmic thing in written history, but it would have been habitable.  

To put in perspective how relatively weak nuclear weapons are, the train station at Hiroshima was running at the end of the day it was bombed and it was less than half a mile from ground zero.  Again, the purpose of our respective nuclear arsenals **is not** to destroy cities and kill people, it's to conduct and win a strategic bombing campaign over a short period of time. 

Most of our nuclear weapons, BTW, are targeted at *other* nuclear weapons.  There isn't much reason for the Russians to target NYC other than perhaps the  airports of the port of NY, for example.  

Just so you know, the order of priority for nuclear warfare is:

* nuclear weapons/delivery systems
* Enemy command and control
* Industrial targets
* transportation targets
* conventional military bases

The irony is that the rural upper Midwest(where the ICBM fields are) would get hit a hell of a lot harder than New England or the SF Bay area, for example.",3,0,1443672484,1444721295

If anything I'd say that we need to keep it where it is or even increase it.  The more you reduce delivery options the greater the chance someone can think that he can take out all our nukes on the first try.  It's why the British and French nuclear deterrents are such jokes, someone could park a sub in their patrol boxes and take out their entire available deterrent(the one submarine on patrol) and then launch a nuclear attack.",0,0,1443671852,1444721295

You do everything possible to make sure someone can't think he can get away with a first strike because a nuclear war costs **far** more than the paltry $20bil or so we spend total maintaining our nuclear arsenal a year.

>any country that does it would be the enemy of the world.

Are you seriously saying that if there was a nuclear exchange betwen the US and Russia, and Russia ""started it""  China would join in against Russia?

Of course not, don't be silly.

No one is going to want to be involved in a nuclear war if they can help it.  Imagine if you were the French President and you got a phone call form the Russians saying they were attacking the US, but it didn't have to involve France unless they wanted it to.  You don't think the French President wouldn't grasp onto that?
