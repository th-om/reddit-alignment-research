cvpcn6a,1,t3_3nm13o,ctrocks,"I have seen before on Reddit that journalists go into that field because they want to report the facts. I disagree with that assumption. I think that people who go into journalism as a whole see egregious situations and want to expose those situations, report on it and right the wrongs of the world. I think as a whole, those people are more likely to be liberal, as a tenant of modern liberalism/progressives is that they want to help the downtrodden and poor. I am not saying that conservatives don't want to help the downtrodden and poor, but they want to help them in a different way, typically through economic growth rather than more direct methods.

The problems is that many of the situations journalists see that cause them to become liberals and want to become journalists for are much more complicated than ""this is awful"". Yes, there are some easy solutions and easy problems, but what is the background. Seeing children who are hungry and in war torn areas is heartbreaking. Seeing companies and people doing wrong is infuriating. I understand where they are coming from.

Why are young black men so much more likely to have negative interactions with the police? Is it racism, is it that they statistically commit way more crime, are they more likely to use drugs in open places versus inside private residences (and therefor much more likely to be caught)? Is there a bit of all of the above? It is so easy to report that as a percentage more young black men are shot, but the why is the hard part. Is it the drug war, is it racism, is it the disintegration of the family structure, the lack of decent paying low skill jobs, gangster rap culture, all of them, none of them?

As a conservative, I will admit I lean towards the disintegration of the family structure and lack of good jobs, which I think are tied together, but everything is tied together. The way forward is complicated and needs to have a multifaceted approach, as there is no easy fix.

And as far as liberal journalists (and conservative too), they tend to show only a part of the picture, quite often the part that aligns with their POV on what is causing the problems. And, I agree that I do not necessarily think it is a conscious effort, but their presumptions about what is causing the problem, and their unwillingness to explain other possibilities and explanations.  Take a look at how /r/politics froths at the mouth at the sheer mention of the Koch brothers, yet they have donated 100's of millions of dollars to worthy causes. Why are they so hated, because the journalists they read only show one side of the story because of their presumptions about people as rich as the Koch brothers. 

And, let us not forget that a lot of times the readers don't want a big complicated story. They want a headline, the simple one paragraph description written with a 6th grade vocabulary, not the whole story. ",14,0,1444079327,1444717042

cvpbiy4,1,t3_3nm13o,zoidberg1339,"I'm inclined to agree with OP. I don't think there's a deliberate effort among most journalists to push a left wing narrative. (with the exception of less-prominent outlets like ThinkProgress and DailyKos, which I believe *do* openly advocate for progressive causes as a matter of course)

Every study I've seen says that journalists who identify as Democrats outnumber those that identify as Republicans 5 (or more) to 1. Even with the best intentions, I don't believe it is possible to have such an ideologically homogenous profession without it impacting what it produces. Any group that makes up 20% or less of a workforce will find itself marginalized. Just look at the experiences of women in male-dominated professions.

I don't think most liberal journalists have any particular ill-will towards conservatism, but I *do* think there is a lack of effort to counteract the effects of such a imbalanced workforce. Even that I wouldn't chalk up to malice, I think most journalists sincerely believe that they're truly impartial.

To use a more extreme example: I've heard from many people that they believe /r/politics has a conservative bias. As a conservative, I wonder if I'm talking about the same subreddit as these people. I've come to realize that when you're a staunch liberal like many /pol subscribers, staunch liberalism doesn't seem like liberalism - it's just normal. The default if you will.

I imagine most journalists feel similarly. As a liberal, you have a certain mindset and a certain worldview that becomes so engrained into your identity that you're not even particularly aware of it. It's just who you are, and it shows in your work. Conservatives are the same way, but they're not the ones writing articles for MSNBC, the Huffington Post, etc.

Mind you, I don't think this is something that only liberals display. I believe conservatives are just as succeptible. It's a human thing, not a liberal thing. But, as every study I know of shows, journalism is a liberal-dominated profession, so the collective assumptions made are liberal ones. Academia is the same way (if not to an even greater extent) because that's a profession with an even *larger* liberal majority.

On the converse, you can look at conservative-dominated professions and see the same phenomenon. But I can't think of a conservative-dominated profession that has the, let's call it ""social visibility"", of journalists, academics, actors, musicians, etc. If there were famous construction workers or what have you we'd doubtlessly hear about a conservative bias in such professions.",20,0,1444077652,1444717053

The FCC would respond to individual complaints that specific broadcasters did not, in their overall programming, present contrasting views on a specific issue covered by the broadcaster.  The FCC would receive a response from the broadcaster, and, based on these filings, would inquire whether it was apparent that the licensee acted in a reasonable fashion and was not arbitrary.

In what way? Yes, the media is to the right of socialists but if we're talking about the American population that isn't on reddit I have to disagree. I can name multiple outlets that are on the American left.

>as well as our politics being restricted to the far right side of the spectrum.

What do you mean ""restricted""? It isn't the early 1950s anymore. You can be a communist in America, you'll just be in a small minority of people. Nobody is entitled to not be a political minority.

Please. Bernie Sanders gets airtime relative to his popularity and I doubt you consider him right of Obama.
