cv4br2m,1,t3_3l9a9z,Precursor2552,"I somewhat disagree with your take on Bush. 

Bush seemed like a nerd, the geek kid who now sorta wants to be cool. And actually I sorta like that about him (although I switched to Rubio after his FA piece) I think he should find a way to work on that and make it his own. 

Christie made me feel like he's running for VP and doing fantastic. Seemed like a pretty good attack dog, as well as trying to save other candidates (Rubio and climate change in particular for the latter). 

Fiorina actually impressed me so much with her FP speech I looked up who her advisor is. Turns out she actually headed up a CIA advisory board, and has a former NSA head advising her so I suspect she actually might know her shit better than I thought. Granted that was the premise of the CNN article I was reading on it.

I wasn't in America for the first debate so this was the first time I saw Trump and Carson debate. I see why they both did well. Carson may stammer on occasion (so do they all) but he spoke plainly, and being a doctor he seems to have a good tone and voice for it. Trump I'm sorry to say is good at the debates. He didn't look great, but especially early on he managed to deflect and distract opponents. I think it was an exchange with Bush or Kasich where I was waiting for them to drop the bankruptcy line, but they got flustered and ended up talking about themselves and defending a much smaller charge rather than killing trump which I thought was a mistake. 

Rubio delivered about 90-95% of what I expect from him, so I thought he did great. I hope he gets the bounce, votes, money, and presidency I think he deserves. ",6,0,1442460812,1444727738

Their is a good reason they avoided it. Fox tried to torpedo Trump with that at the first debate and he turned it around amazingly well. 

Compared to the first debate, they all tried their hardest to avoid attacking Trump unless they absolutely had to. Trump is just too damn good at banter. None of them wanted Trump to make them look like a joke. It was like they were all afraid of him. You could just see it in their faces when CNN would try to goad them into attacking him.

cv4cp5h,1,t3_3l9a9z,DevonWeeks,"Fiorina has foreign policy experience that many, by design, are not aware of, and it was good to see her show some of that here.  I think she ultimately comes out the winner here because every time she gets in front of crowds she inches up in the polls.  Even if her debate performance isn't the strongest, the stands to gain the most from the publicity.  Trump only stands to lose ground from this debate, and most of the other candidates can't overcome the anti-establishment sentiment among the base well enough to capitalize on their good debate performances.  Even if Fiorina doesn't have the best academic performance here, I'm almost positive that early next week the polls will she gained the most ground relative to any candidate on the stage.  Does that make her the ""winner?""  Maybe.  Maybe not.  It does make her the most benefitted, though.",3,0,1442462778,1444727738
