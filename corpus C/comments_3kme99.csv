It's likely that Republicans don't alienate as many people as you think, but it appears like they are to you, because people in general tend to seek-out politically similar friends.

It seems the country is leaning left currently (my opinion, plenty of room for debate), so why would you dig your heels into try to completely change those views? Would it not be easier to move people one step right rather than 10?

I consider myself independent and lean liberal - I am just trying to talk about the strategy

cuyn17y,1,t3_3kme99,houinator,">  They wouldn't lose their religious vote, because they would be just barely more religious.

I think it's a mistake to assume the Democrats couldn't outflank them on religion.  They have all but locked up the African American vote, a group that has some very religious communities and have a commanding lead among Hispanics, who also tend to be fairly religious.  You have Democrats like Stephen Colbert who are still deeply religious, but find the Democrats positions more in line with those values.  You look at Pope Francis, and on nearly everything except gay marriage and abortion, his positions are closer to Bernie Sanders than the GOP.

> Surely the politicians are not religious enough for this to actually be a factor.

I'd disagree, at least on certain issues there are some politicians who are very influenced by their religion.

cuz1ipx,1,t3_3kme99,kingvitaman,"The comments here mostly seem to miss the mark in my opinion. There's a pretty clear explaination as to why modern day conservatives tend to swing so far to the right socially. In the late 70s Reagan began working with Jerry Fallwell to court the evangelical vote. People forget that before that conservatives tended to be more libertarian, and less about social conservatism than they are now. This worked well in the 80s as a whole generation which was still rebelling against the 70s and the Vietnam war. They talked about a culture war, and they are clearly the losers. Almost all major social conservative issues go towards progressives, and the former Moral Majority is beginning to seem antiquated. This is true if you look at polls of even young conservatives. The problem is, as you noted, is that the fundamentalists tend to be very reliable voters, and are essential to get nominations. They have to play to them. And the GOP voters mean business. Really, they're much more spiteful than Democrats. Just look at Trump's number or the rise of the Tea Party. They'll routinely kick out members of their own party who aren't in line. There's nothing comparable on the left. For most Democrat voters somebody not being a Republican is enough, there isn't a quest for ideological purity. Hence the reason why the Right Wing is much more prominent and catered to in the US as opposed to liberals. ",2,0,1442072268,1444729815
