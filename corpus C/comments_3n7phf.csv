>How should we feel about a politician declaring that the status of the fetus provides no basis for abortion policy

She was cranky and didn't want to answer the question. How arrogant to point out that he could ask the question because of the first admendment but then shut him down because he wasn't a mother and she was.

For what it's worth, I'll be very happy when Pelosi, Reid, Boehner and McConnell are all out of the limelight.  We need new leadership across the board and IMO this is why ""outsiders"" are doing well in the primaries.",0,0,1443785648,1444720708
cvm35pl,1,t3_3n7phf,perrycarter,I agree with her.  Abortion is a lightning rod distractionary issue that single issue voters latch onto.  We would be better off not knowing our Congress people's views on abortion.,1,0,1443817856,1444720708
cvm44kd,0,t1_cvm35pl,Political_Throwawayz,"to play devil's advocate, if you believe that fetuses are human beings with the same rights as any other human then it's not a stretch to view our abortion laws as permitting the mass genocide of society's most innocent members. Seems about as important an issue as there can be in domestic policy. ",1,0,1443819390,1444720712

cvljt1q,1,t3_3n7phf,chitwin,As to your first question. No. I would love to see a male politician say something along  those lines to a female reporter. As far as number 2 goes. It shouldn't surprise you the Democrats don't believe there should be any restrictions on abortion ,-3,0,1443785142,1444720716

No, that's weak. If the reporter called Pelosi a ""stupid whore"" or some gendered slur then that's fair grounds to dismiss any question that preceded or followed such an insult. But asking a Congresswoman a question about a women's health issue that pertains to public policy is perfectly fair. It's not like he asked her if she'd ever had a miscarriage or anything personal.

It was a tough question, but a fair one. Pelosi decided to hide behind her gender and the gender of the reporter rather than answer it. Rather cowardly if you ask me, but politicians are often a cowardly bunch.

>How should we feel about a politician declaring that the status of the fetus provides no basis for abortion policy?

It's not really surprising. My understanding of the position of (at least most of) the Democratic Party is that the discussion starts and ends with the pregnant woman in question. As long as the fetus/child/bundle of cells is inside the woman, it is hers to do with as she pleases.

As a libertarian the concept resonates with me, but I'm not entirely comfortable with it. I truly don't believe the fetus' well-being can be entirely disregarded.",0,0,1443815213,1444720716
