cv8e6g6,0,t1_cv8e06d,kevinbaconjames,"Here's how I see this playing out:

After Iowa and NH, the clown car clears out and we are left with the serious candidates. The non-establishment guys give up, Walker and Paul focus on their own re-election. Maybe someone like Cruz sticks around for a while, but he's not a serious contender. It comes down to Bush and Rubio. 

While not an ""anti-establishment"" candidate, Rubio beats Bush on the back of his appeal as a fresh face, with new ideas and a new identity for the party to rally around. His youth becomes a major selling point against both Bush and Clinton. 

He picks Haley because he doesn't want to give up the idea of youth that got him this far, plus it ticks a diveristy box. 

Personally, I think it would be a formidable ticket.",1,0,1442789063,1444726326

Maybe, but she doesn't add anything to the ticket. I'd look more to the South for a VP

>Joe Biden - Julian Castro

A bit under-qualified, but adds diversity to the ticket. Alternate choice: Mazie Hirono from Hawaii

>Bernie Sanders - Cory Booker (although i'm not sure Booker would accept)

Doesn't make much sense. Booker was a big-money, Wall-Street backed candidate

>Jeb Bush - John Kasich

Other than the ""two old white guys"" aspect, its a pretty solid ticket.

>Marco Rubio - Nikki Haley

That's a pretty inexperienced ticket. Haley is someone to look towards for the next guy, I think. Kasich (if willing) should be the guy here.

>Scott Walker - Marco Rubio

Pretty solid.

>Ted Cruz - Donald Trump

No. Bad /u/kevinbaconjames. Go to your room.

The pick here should be someone with either foreign policy or executive experience. Jim Gilmore or Ron Johnson, maybe?

>Mike Huckabee - Ben Carson

Sure, why not.

>Rand Paul - Tom Cotton

A bad choice if you ask me. Cotton adds nothing to the ticket, and is a bit neocon to pair with Paul.

I could see Paul reaching across the aisle for a guy like Feingold or Wyden, or taking a guy like Jim Jordan from Ohio",4,0,1442788062,1444726326
cv90u31,0,t1_cv8djvn,Lambchops_Legion,">Maybe, but she doesn't add anything to the ticket.

Most winning tickets haven't. Cheney didn't anything to Bush's ticket - a neocon picking his dad's Sec of Defense. George HW Bush didn't add anything to Reagan's ticket, similar to Quayle. Clinton, a southern democrat added a southern democrat to his ticket in Al Gore.

Obama is really the first president in a long time where that actually worked.

Klobuchar at least adds midwest flavor to someone who is now considered northeast elite.

That being said, Clinton appeal should be to the moderate dems, so I could see her choosing someone from VA like Webb, McAuliffe, or Kaine. Ideally, I'd like her to pick Jack Markell, but that's more who I think would be best to govern, not who I think who be best strategically to win the election.",1,0,1442845880,1444726326

So let's take that line of logic one step further: what candidates would add that to Hillary's campaign?",1,0,1442847098,1444726326
cv9d1p2,0,t1_cv91jl1,reasonably_plausible,"Hillary adds it to her own campaign; Bush 43, Clinton, and Reagan were all only state governors and Obama was perceived as inexperienced, their respective Vice Presidents were to give their ticket inside links to the legislature / D.C. politics.

Hillary has the benefit of balancing her own ticket in almost every way. She has judicial, executive, and legislative experience. She's been a government worker, a corporate executive, and run non-profits. She has favored son (daughter?) claims in the midwest, south, and the northeast. She already has high favorability ratings among different minority groups, so no need to pander. Her political orientation falls smack in the center of the Democratic base, yet she's perceived as a centrist, so she doesn't need to really solidify the base, nor moderate her campaign. There's not much in her campaign that is lacking that a VP could potentially patch up, except for youth.

Barring any major developments, Clinton's VP choice will be all about who will be groomed to run for president in 2024 (2020 if Clinton's health declines). ",1,0,1442864948,1444726326

OK, again, let's take a step further: who is that? Klobuchar? A Castro brother? How would you feel about Jack Markell?",1,0,1442866764,1444726326
cv9h5wx,0,t1_cv9e8tq,reasonably_plausible,"My money has been on Julian Castro since the last DNC, he'd continue the ""historic elections"" for the Democrats and 2024 would be a good year to attempt to pull Texas into the battlefield column. However, he currently doesn't have any major political experience, a death sentence for a presidential campaign, but not really necessary to become VP for an experienced candidate. He's the potential candidate who stands to gain the most from being VP.

His brother is in a similar situation in terms of lack of experience, but considering that he has already been elected to the House, he may want to stay there for a few terms and wait for a favorable year to run for Senate. 2024 has Cruz's seat up for election, Texas would be somewhat more blue, and Julian could be running for president, that could be a great year for him to make a push.

Jack Markell is currently a governor, which is a great track to running for president. He'd do well to gain the national notoriety that being a VP would bring, but leaving him as governor for a while longer doesn't really hurt his chances of eventually having a successful presidential campaign.

Klobuchar would be a good pick dependent on how the Planned Parenthood stuff shakes out. 2014 showed that in normal times Democrats can't run exclusively on the ""War on Women"" in abstract, it definitely can work against individual candidates saying stupid things about rape. But without the Republican candidate playing into the narrative, the accusations tend to fall flat as we saw in the midterms. 

However, if the government were to shut down due to Republican refusal to fund Planned Parenthood, you have an event that will be able to be brought up in every presidential debate. Not only as a symbol of how Republicans perpetuate the ""War on Women"", but also about their failure to effectively govern and excessive brinkmanship. If the Republican nominee is someone who had voted to cause such a shutdown, I could definitely see Clinton doubling down on the women's issues part of her campaign by choosing another woman as her running mate. If the government doesn't shut down or if the Republican nominee wasn't a part of shutting it down, I don't see her making it a big enough focus to choose a female VP. As well, Klobuchar is already a senator in a state that's pretty safe for Democrats, another election or two and she's ready to go for president anyway.",1,0,1442871265,1444726326
cv8e0mg,0,t1_cv8djvn,kevinbaconjames,"I found the last three tough because none of them actually have a chance of winning, so its kind of tough to guess what they would do. 

Maybe Ted Cruz would go moderate, maybe he would stay with what got him this far. Same with Rand Paul, does he pick another LIbertarian or go moderate?

I will defend my Klobuchar pick, I think if Hillary doesn't go wth Castro she should definitely doube down and pick another woman as VP, it would really help turnout and bring back the Obama coalition, especially if people aren't very excited for her. I said Klobuchar because she is relatively young, midwestern, and amongst the best female member of the Democratic party. Maggie Hassan would be another potential pick.

I said Booker for Sanders because he is one of the most progressive Senators, and one of the few people who are close ot Bernies positions on many issues. If the criteria is that he picks only a VP who has not taken corporate money, there is a very short list of possible candidates. I also said Booker because Bernie struggles with the black vote, although in this hypothetical situation wherein he has won the Democratic nomination, he would have to have suddenly become much more popular with african americans anyway, so its hard to tell. 

However, Booker has an incredibly bright future ahead of him, and wouldn't want the stench of a failed presidential ticket ot hang over him. If Sanders gets nominated it is extremely unlikey he wins the general, and so I could see Booker turning him down. (rumours say that Marco Rubio tuned down Romney in 2012 for the same reason).

cv8dzms,1,t3_3lptc1,lmaoo-sure,"- Scott Walker would be smart to pick Marco Rubio as a running mate. Two low key, low baggage guys running against (presumably) Hillary would be amazing.

- Rubio might pick Walker, but I feel someone might encourage him to pick Jeb. I hope he doesn't follow that advice.

- Paul & Cruz would pick each other.

- Mike Huckabee might try to pick Jesus as a running mate. When someone fills him in that its not going to happen, he would probably pick Cruz.

- Jeb Bush: I don't know. Kasich, maybe? He needs someone with just enough gravitas to pull in the Conservative base, but not enough to overshadow him. Compassionate conservatism worked for his brother, having someone on the ticket who fits that mold might do good for him.

- Biden has already met with Elizabeth Warren. Nothings set in stone, but I feel she would held him bring in the economic progressives.

- Bernie Sanders would need a strong establishment figure to reassure the powers that be that he isn't going to turn the system upside down. Gillibrand? Al Franken? Something tells me he'd pick Warren, though.

- I don't see Hillary sharing the spotlight with another woman, so Booker? A nice guy with celebrity appeal and no real baggage. He'd also help get the minority vote.",3,0,1442788752,1444726326
