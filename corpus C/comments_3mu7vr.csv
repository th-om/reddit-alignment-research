First, there was the rise of true neoliberal ideology. Reagan, thatcher, Hayek, Mises, and the think tank culture wanted to confront socialism by creating a value system that could 'intellectually' and morally oppose it. This is where we first start to see laissez-faire and small government ideals getting treated as moral imperatives. This is where we first see modern ""small government"" rhetoric. Rightism transitioned from being a narrow class-based belief system to something the average person could buy into. 

Second, there was in the '80s a global resurgence of political religion. People have described this as ""undertheorized"" - we don't really know why it happened. The political evangelicals in America, the catholic solidarity movement in Poland and the eastern bloc, liberation theology in Latin America, the rise of Islamism in the Middle East, and the Iranian revolution all happened in this era.

securing greater efficiency in government by the application of the principles of constructive economy, in order that there may be a reduction of the burden of taxation now borne by the American people.

Congress has not passed the Every Child Achieves Act, they are in conference right now as both bills from the house and senate are different.

> A trade deal

By this you must mean the TPA/TPP?  I personally am solidly against this bill, so I can't agree that this is in fact something that should be lauded.  However, many here disagree with me on this, and I can report there were MANY people in /r/politics who were supporters of the TPP who upvoted articles about it and discussed it. 

This is a fair thing for GOP and 'free trade' supporters to point to as a positive.

> A transportation spending package

The Highway bill?  That's a *legislative accomplishment?*  C'mon.  Congress regularly passes a highway bill several times a decade!

Not only that, but the House and Senate GOP couldn't agree on a final bill, don't you recall?  They passed a 3-month extension until October.  Unless Thune is talking about something else, this isn't a win for the GOP - it's a negative thing.  

> The Every Child Achieves Act

This is an accomplishment?  Has a reconciled bill passed both the House and the Senate?  Have they negotiated with the WH to come up with a version the Prez will sign?  I think the answer to both of those questions is a decided no.  I can't count this as something worth talking positively about when the hard work of negotiating between houses of Congress and with the WH hasn't been done yet.  

> The first balanced budget resolution since 2001

This is a sham of an accomplishment - the 'balanced budget resolution' hasn't resulted in anything even approaching a balanced budget.  The only way they could claim they are passing a 'balanced budget' is by adding on many billions of defense spending dollars as a 'sidecar' to Price's approved budget.  

When the actual cuts needed to produce a balanced budget were put on paper, the House GOP didn't stand firm.  They simply cheated.

Limbaugh and Liddy were powerful on radio, but not to the extent they are now.

What was weird was that, as soon as Bush II won, their narrative and anxiety completely stopped, or at least it wasn't very loud.  The same issues were there, but they collectively decided not to complain about them.  And then when Obama was elected, all of that anger and anxiety that was suppressed during Bush EXPLODED.  By then, of course, the economy had tanked, and they knew that Bush had screwed us all over with his war lies, but they couldn't bring themselves to blame Bush, so it all focused on Obama.

Perhaps you are in that 1% I said didn't stop protesting. Did you protest from 02-08? Are you saying you saw the same level of protest under Obama?

>What about occupy?

What abbot Occupy *Wall Street*? That movement didn't protest Obama in any way, it protested wall street. They staked out the homes of Manhattan elites, local parks, and stopped traffic for normal everyday workers... In fact, they did everything they could to keep from protesting Obama directly or publicly. Instead it was ""Occupy Oakland"" and the local government and not the federal level.

>What about after snowden? Or after al-awlaki? You haven't seen the backlash in progressive media to Obama?

No, not on foreign policy - not at all. I have seen Snowden or Awlaki to be points of protest by a select few.

And Obama has certainly not been given the treatment the same exact crowd gave Bush and Blair. No where near it.

>Everyone I talk to and hear on the media feels a sense of betrayal from obama, that he sold us a bag of goods. I've been criticizing Obama since 2011.

Like I said, there can be consistency - Dennis Kusinich was a good example (And he was thanked by the DNC for his consistancy by being re-districted out of office)  - but that portion of the population is very small.

>I think the hypocrisy you're talking about is there but isn't nearly as prevalent as you think it is.

I think if you stop for a moment and think about it, especially if you were an active protester from 02-08, you would know exactly how right I am.

I find the bigger crime will be that the same 99% that stopped protesting under president Obama will be welcomed back with open arms by the anti-war left when a republican takes office... that 1% that was actually anti-war won't turn away the opportunist DNC member who will diligently explain that bombing Gaddafi for 10 months doesn't count as war because there are no boots on the ground...

I do. In Iraq the US and UK took responsibility for their actions, after deposing a tyrant they helped the citizens rebuild, form a trained army and police force, hold free and fair elections, and created as stable democracy that is still a democracy 13 years later - even after being invaded by a 30,000 man army of the world's most battle hardened jihadists.

In Libya we just bombed the place from orbit, handed out guns like candy to untrained and unaccountable militias, and abandoned Libya to those militias one week after Gaddafi's get away convoy was destroyed by a US drone. Libya looks like a mad max movie today, with ISIS flags going up - having never been a stable democracy and had 50,000+ die in the first year.

>Not just boots on the ground. We dropped way more bombs way more frequently in Iraq. Whether it's called a war or not, it's a huge improvement from the Bush years.

I'm not sure how anyone looks at Libya and says that. or the 250,000+ dead in Syria. Or the last year and a half of bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

You sure are right about those savings up front - but what this strategy has created is a ME that looks nothing like the place that Obama was handed in 09.

Uday's bodyguards picked up the signal and walked through the darkened room, flicking cigarette lighters as they approached the girl's table. Uday, then 33, flipped on his too, confirming they had identified the right one. When the girl left the table for the powder room, Uday's bodyguards approached her with a choice, says Shabaan, who was Uday's business manager. She could ascend the platform now and congratulate Uday on his recovery, or she could call him on his private phone that night. Flustered, she apologized and said her parents would allow neither. One of the guards replied, ""This is the chance of your life"" and promised she would receive diamonds and a car. ""All you have to do is go up there for 10 minutes,"" he urged. When she demurred again, the bodyguards pursued Uday's backup plan. They maneuvered the girl in the direction of the parking lot, picked her up and carried her to the backseat of Uday's car, covering her mouth to muffle her screams.

After three days the girl was returned to her home, with a new dress, a new watch and a large sum of cash. Her parents had her tested for rape; the result was positive. According to Shabaan's account, Uday heard she had been tested and sent aides to the clinic, where they warned doctors not to report a rape. Furious, the father demanded to see Saddam himself. Rebuffed, he kept complaining publicly about what Uday had done. After three months, the President's son had had enough. He sent two guards to the man to insist that he drop the matter. Uday had another demand: that the ex-governor bring his daughter and her 12-year-old sister to his next party. ""Your daughters will be my girlfriends, or I'll wipe you off the face of the earth.""

FDR was so popular and was such a respected President, that on economic issues Republicans had to go to the left to ""combat"" him. It also misses the fact that in the 50-70's was when all the stories off Union corruption and ties to the mob where revealed. This is probably more responsible for the decline of Unions in the US than anything else. 

Republicans have always been the party of management and big business, all the way back to the parties foundation. Lincoln  allowed trade to continue between the Union and Confederacy.  John D. Rockefeller was a Republican, Andrew Carnegie was a Republican, Henry Ford was a Republican. Noticing a trend? Almost all the tycoons where Republicans and they almost all universally hated Unions.

 Look at Republicans during the 30's and 20's. Especially in the 30's lots of Republicans *hated* FDR, and the Federal programs he introduced. Herbert Hoover famously responded to the beginning of the Great Depression by doing almost nothing, believing the government should stay out of the market. Sound Familiar?

Eisenhower who is commonly elevated by Democrats as some example of a Reasonable Republican of yor,  said that he made two mistakes when he was President and both of them are sitting on the Supreme Court. He was referring to Justices Earl Warren, and Brennan. Both of them where famous for there Liberal/Progressive rulings they made while on the Supreme Court. 

And before people trot out, but muh muh T.R! Everyone stops the story with T.R running for the Bull Moose party. They miss out where he reconciled with the Conservative wing of the Party and was going run for President as a Republican in 1920, and then he died. Also there are still Republicans like T.R in the Party. John McCain's views are remarkably close to T.R's.

cviihzv,1,t3_3mu7vr,mywan,"In the 1950s the classical Keynesians dominated under a demand side policy agenda. The success of the growing economy made it hard to argue against. That is up until the 1970s when we got hit with stagflation. Something that the *classical* Keynesians thought to be impossible at the time. This followed a period when capital returns, relative to labor returns, hit historical lows. The inflation was driven by the capital goods market, not consumer driven.

Once stagflation became the economic monster policy makers went to war on it got resolved during the Reagan administration, with a push toward supply side policies. This set Reagan up to be lionized for generations. Then came the Clinton years, which involve historical levels of massive layoffs and downsizing mixed with very low unemployment. This was the first period in modern economic history in which economic growth was driven by supply side investment rather than consumer spending. Clinton's policies laid the foundation for the Third Way democrats, which is basically supply side democrats. 

Hence traditionally our two parties included a supply side party and a demand side party. Only now both parties are essentially supply side parties, even if they differ somewhat on what good supply side policies should look like. With the democrats taking on the traditional role of the republicans as both parties compete in the supply side arena the republicans take on an ever more extreme laissez faire policy approach in so far as it applies to moneyed interest, i.e., capital interest. Often even to the degree of creating barriers to any up and coming business competitors to those capital interest. 

The libertarians tend to have a more nuanced ideology, but tend to play right into the political hands of the oligarchic power structure that is less concerned with the libertarians broader based ideology. Yet shutting down government functions is often seen as a good on the ""starve the beast"" strategy. So while the libertarians see this as a means to empower everybody the oligarchs see it as a means to grab that power themselves. Thus conflicting objectives have aligned around a common short term strategy, which even the racist, homophones, xenophobes, religious interests, etc., etc., all see a means to achieve some part of their pet objectives.

However, there are other effects besides forcing a spending reduction. Drying up government funding also reduces the power government has to regulate business. What regulatory power remains is easier to acquire through [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture).

cvi4xd7,1,t3_3mu7vr,littlebitsoffluff,"I'm just armchair theorizing here based on what I've read and lived.

 It's very complicated, but generally speaking, U.S. society itself became more conservative, and polarized, over the long term. In the 50's we were just coming off a war to end all wars and the country was more in solidarity with itself. Fighting an external enemy always brings the extremes closer to the middle; without them, they tend to fight between themselves. Vietnam and the 60s generation created a great schism in the country that was based on cynicism of government (and cynicism in general). This created a leftist movement that repulsed the right. 

The rise of conservative talk radio in the 80's was maybe not the start, but in my memory was certainly the first very public utterances, of a no-holds-barred scorched-earth sort of means to win public opinion. Economically, the paths of money flow in the U.S. dried up to the point where there are far fewer let me call them ""money rivers"" by which wealth was created and distributed (I'm no economist, apologies for my terminology). Basically in the old days there were tons of local companies producing goods in the U.S.; now there are few, and most stuff comes en masse from China. Where there's money, there's power, and so power and wealth-generation became centralized among fewer people, people who could set agendas and control the popular messages. At the same time, prosperous times turned lean, things got expensive, it takes greater training or education to maintain the same standard of pay, and so people got shrill as they felt the economic pressure of no longer having a relatively easy lifestyle. It's much easier to be generous and magnanimous when your own belly is full, no empty.

People's aspirations changed. In the 50's and 60's, being smart and educated was admired. Now celebrity is held in greater regard. Critical thinking skills and the worldview centered on science and logic began to fade. In its place came something like a pseudo-religious worldview, where beliefs are more important than reasoned argument. Lately the Left is beginning to show some of this same type of pseudo-religious worldview, but the Right had it first, I think.

Basically when you look at it from a 30,000-foot view, all the elements of a cultural shift. 

I'm actually somewhat conservative myself, though it sounds like I'm knocking it above. Part of the transition too was not just because of what conservatism was becoming, but as a reaction to what liberalism and progressivism promised, forced, and then failed to achieve. The Great Society didn't work out like it was supposed to in many ways, and the problem was, imposing it really pissed a lot of people off because it messed with their way of life. You can see a more modern analogy to this, except on a smaller scale, in the right's reaction to Obamacare. It pissed off a lot of people, its worth is of questionable value, and people on the right are doing their best to destroy it.

I was solidly Republican.  Up until W Bush where I registered independent but still voted Republican against my better judgement in 2008.

Way too many lies during the Bush years and am incredible squandering of lives, treasure, and political good will in some kind of crazy scheme to bring democracy to the middle East.  Truth is the Bush administration was inept.  I don't recognize the Republican party anymore and nothing they have promised has come to fruition.  We've lost more of our rights, not gained security, they destroyed the economy and everyone I know either has lost their job or taken a pay cut, and they've brought such a radical form of social values that I struggle to even see them as Americans.

>equal pay for equal work regardless of Sex.

The paycheck fairness act was more of a bone to the trial lawyers than anything else.  Republicans aren't going to put money in the pocket of the democrats funding arm.

And the actual issue has largely been fixed.  Women can and do work as CEOS and go to college at higher rates than men.  I don't see the need for some giant, permanent federal bureaucracy to oversee gender pay equality.  I'm sure in 500 years, progressives still will strongly support affirmative action, but the situation on gender equality has changed in 60 years.

Again, the situation has completely changed.  Nobody was talking about unionized government workers, who are now a rock solid source of money for dems.  Unions have grown in power as rules changed to the point that they can and do drive their employer out of business.  Its not unreasonable to see that there might be some reforms, which Sanders naturally will call ""anti worker"", because every nickel of his Senate campaigns have been funded by big labor.  This is as much partisan jabs at the other sides money as it is policy.

>legislators have undermined collective bargaining rights in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio and other states.

**Government** workers have been the target of this.  But Sanders gets gobs of money from government workers, so he supports their right to unionize (and take money from government workers without consent and give it to him).

Can you provide a link to this?  The 2015 Trustee's report doesn't show evidence of a billions-dollar shortfall in any month.

The rest of your argument is simply an Inflation Hawk argument.  There's no reason at all to believe that interest rates will be 14% in 2030.

Yes, that's exactly how it works.  The money collected years ago as a surplus was spent immediately.

Gladly.  $76 billion per year  http://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/

""Social Security’s total expenditures have exceeded non-interest income of its combined trust funds since 2010, and the Trustees estimate that Social Security cost will exceed non-interest income throughout the 75-year projection period. The Trustees project that this annual cash-flow deficit will average **about $76 billion between 2015 and 2018** before **rising steeply**""

So in five years, it'll be worse.

You don't think two decades of trillion dollar borrowing will have an effect on interest rates?  And we have no idea what else might happen.  CA could suffer a major quake, and we'd lose tons of tax revenue at the same time we need lots of money to rebuild.

I understand the ""creating jobs that could pay less than minimum wage.""  but I have no idea what the logic of ""current minimum-wage jobs would pay more"" is.  The only reason any job would pay minimum wage is because they have to; otherwise they would continue to lower it until they can get the just-good-enough employee to fill it.

I'm just a few days shy of 36, so I've literally got more than twice the lifetime experience you have (and more than 10x the working experience, I'd wager, especially since I grew up on a farm and was  doing some serious labor by the time I was 10.)

I work for less than that.  Nobody wants to, but people are aren't 16 are far, far more likely to *have no choice in the matter*.  If I don't bring home at least a little money, I die.  Period.

I'm not successfully saving money, but it isn't because it isn't ""worth it"" to me.  It is because no matter how much I save, it isn't enough, since things like cars breaking down happen.

Kissinger's paranoid neo-conservatism soaked the GOP is Vietnamese and to a much lesser extent young American blood, creating enormous bad karma, then Nixon imploded, Carter rose and failed, and Reagan was injected into the power vacuum by Rupert Murdoch and his minions, energized by the bad equations and selfish ideology of the neoliberals.  Reagan then wrecked the peaceful transition of the USSR to social democracy, somehow taking credit for that as if he did anything but cause a kleptocracy in its place, and meanwhile the US passed Hubbert's Peak and its role in the world profoundly shifted.  Japan rose, causing a new paranoia causing neoliberals to further sell the American Idea down the river, destroying the union movement and therefore the backbone of the middle class, and the collapse towards unsustainable oligarchy proceeded apace.  Meanwhile the operatives gaming the election system cultivated the religious right, with the blessings of the neo-cons, who thought Americans could not handle the truth and would turn into Nazi Germany if they weren't sotted with delusional beliefs.

These things are now what Republicans do, but was once something only Democrats would do.

How about Clinton's healthcare bill, that wasn't even as extreme as Obamacare, but literally couldn't even get brought up for a vote in a Democrat controlled Congress. Healthcare is a huge economic issue, that a majority of Democrats shared the same views as Republicans do now. Just in that metric Democrats have gone from opposing healthcare bills in the past that weren't that bad, to now arguing for the most extreme version of healthcare reform.

Hell, 40 years ago, Democrats literally pushed a bill through congress, with more Republican opposition for a pipeline through one of the most pristine areas of North America, yet today won't even approve a small extension of an already existing pipeline. That's a huge economic issue, yet something Democrats have went from supporting 100%, to now being in 100% opposition as a party.

Just look at military spending. Only 15-20 years ago, any Democrat outside of inner city areas pushed so many military spending bills through congress, to the point where several prominent Democrats would be considered bigger warmongers than most Republicans now. Look at Harry Reid, literally the lead Democrat in Congress, pushed through bills for storage of Nuclear waste only a decade ago, now their party has stood up and voted against even using the facility.

These weren't just any Democrats, but Democrats that were in office for 40 years. Now, you wouldn't have any Democrat support for things like this, but they sure did support it a decade ago.

Sanders became an independent, [because he didn't think the Democrat party was left enough for him.](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/bernie-sanders-2016-democrats-121181) He literally started his political career by running against some of the more left Democrats at the time. Now, he is running for President as a Democrat, and has 25% support. 25 years ago, someone who describes himself as some kind of socialist, wouldn't even get taken seriously in national politics, let alone have a quarter of the Democrat party supporting him.

Holy fuck, [Bill Clinton](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/18/us/clinton-s-economic-plan-the-spending-cuts-a-wide-swath-on-earth-and-in-the-sky.html) literally called to cut funding on program, after program. From veterans to welfare, he proposed massive cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars. And called to literally cut farming subsidies, of which Democrats are opposed to now. These are things that no Democrat would think of now, and will sling mud at every Republican for even thinking of doing, in not even an as extreme manner.

Just look at GS. It was ended under a Democrat, and now you have every Democrat clamoring to get it back, for no real good reason. That's another huge economic issue, yet something that Democrats were once for, but now almost completely against.

Bill Clinton literally called to pretty much cripple NASA for 4 years due to budget cuts ,to the tune of cutting their budget by almost 50%. Now, god forbid Ted Cruz wants to cut their budget by 5%, which was on par with Obama's cuts, yet you have every left leaning politician and armchair pundit calling him a ""science denier"" or whatever the term is now.

Seriously. Come the fuck on. The Democrat party over the years, especially the past 30-40 years, and went from a party that was almost exactly like Republicans today. Military spending, no healthcare, cut medicaid, no abortions, cut the budget of every single government department, including almost gutting several key departments like NASA. But yet, it's the Republican party that has moved the most, and are the most extreme, when it's Democrats who have gone from basically a middle of the road political party, to now pushing socialist policies, and supporting actual socialists for President.

You don't need a scale to manipulate your views, when actually looking at what Democrats once were, to what they are now.

Goldwater was by far the most right-leaning Republican since the beginning of the 20th Century (I discount Ron Paul because off his foreign policy views), and he would have no prayer of getting the nomination today.",0,0,1443552668,1444722464

cvijcjk,1,t3_3mu7vr,ultralame,"Each party actually used to have conservative and liberal factions.  The issues we consider to be clear Dem/GOP issues were much more shuffled between the two parties.

Then came realignment of the parties after civil rights.  Essentially, the civil rights legislation turned off many of the southern democrats to their own party, and they fled to the conservative faction of the GOP (Reagan).

Meanwhile, the soutern religious factions that had formerly been warring with one another started to progress enough to juuussssst stop hating one another in order to galvanize around both those pesky civil rights and rally around abortion.  (We barely even think about the anti-Catholic fervor in this country, the days when Baptists hated Methodists and inter-religious marriage was frowned upon across the board).

So now you had a galvanized white religious base that was fleeing the Democrats, pissed off about the loss of states' rights (in the wake of integrating schools) and looking for a new home.

cvin8zd,1,t3_3mu7vr,Brettster,"They found a way to tie ""states rights"" coded racism in with religious fundamentalism in with their long-held Big Business ""trickle-down"" ideology in with the rising Milton Friedman school of laissez faire ideology. It all blended in a way where they could all demonize the same people and get southerners and midwesterners to believe that votes for big business interests and capital gains tax cuts and so forth were tied to their racial and religious and social attitudes. By demonizing welfare queens, for example, they discovered they could kill all the birds with one stone.

They've also found a self-service cycle in their anti-government rhetoric. The more they demonize government as incompetent and immoral, the more they can sabotage and corrupt the government to their ends and then point to their work as an example of their rhetoric. It's worked brilliantly up until recently. Their rhetoric on tax cuts is similar. The more they pretended that tax cuts would solve all of our problems, the more the deficit grew under said tax cuts. Then they claim that we're ""over spending"" and get to cut all their most hated programs.

The thing that has ALWAYS defined the GOP is a total allegiance to big business. Their stances of basic political and social issues have gotten way polarized. But it all serves the same master in the end.",0,0,1443566386,1444722464

Democratic party lost a lot of voters sticking its head out for civil rights. Nixon was ideologically an Eisenhower republican, but he also engaged in the southern strategy to get votes.

He is not a good example of the Republican party as a whole in the '50s. The President controls messaging for the party (mostly), so things released by the GOP itself came from Eisenhower and his campaign, rather than being representative.
