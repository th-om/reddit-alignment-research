As well, Trump doesn't do well with minorities, so it would suit him to pick a hispanic or black running mate. 

Rubio seems the most diametrically opposed to Trump: he's young, Hispanic, and a career politician. However, Rubio has been a vocal opponent of Trump, so I can't imagine him easily accepting Trump's offer for VP unless the polls keep Trump at the top for the next many, many months.",5,0,1442256151,1444728878
