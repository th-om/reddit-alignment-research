How is anything you've described comparable to guns being taken away? Or even the 2nd amendment being infringed upon?

If you want further evidence of this, California also used registration requirements in the Roberti Roos act to force firearms owners to register their SKS rifles. If the rifle was not registered, the owner was committing a felony.  They then turned around and banned a type of SKS rifles and used the registry to confiscate all registered ones.  

And no, the LA magazine ban makes no provision for grandfathering.

I just want to take this opportunity to point out that conservatives fully support these types of restrictions on abortion. If you can't ban a constitutional right, regulate it so much that it becomes as difficult as possible to exercise. The argument about the creating de facto bans is literally the exact same argument liberals make in regards to heavy regulation of abortion providers.

* The California AG then commented that he thought SKSs that were originally manufactured as fixed magazine but were modified to be detachable didn't violate the AWB. 
* A lot of people started modifying their fixed magazine SKSs to be detachable, or bought pre-modified SKSs. Some of them registered their now detachable SKSs.
* The California AG walked back his statements, saying the modified SKSs were not exempt from the AWB. **Edit:** The walk back was made after a California appellate court upheld a ruling saying that modified SKSs were in fact prohibited by the AWB.
* California implemented a buyback program for the SKSs that were illegally purchased, and used the registry to send out letters to people who registered their guns.

We're past the middle ground. The problem is that you aren't acknowledging that the ""middle ground"" is being redefined after each restriction so that the goal of banning is closer.

California's firearms laws are supposedly there to reduce crime. Yet, despite this, they seem to have zero effect on actually being effective.  San Francisco literally drove their last gun store out of business.  LA just banned high cap magazines.  California bans new firearms that aren't on their ""safety roster"" (which they can change the standards on at any time).

cvq6usm,0,t1_cvpk522,Gnome_Sane,"Well for a few reasons, hunting and sport shooting.

But the specific reason refereed to in your quote is ""in case we need to make an army out of citizens"". And that reason was very important to the people who wrote it, because they had just done this.

But honestly - let's try to see each others argument better.

Your definition of a militia is a military made up of ordinary citizens, right?

You are quoting the specific line that explains to you why the population needs guns - it is in case they need to form a militia (as the colonials were able to do here in the US. Back in Europe guns were strictly controlled, especially in urban areas.) so as you quote:

*A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state*

**,**

(In case we ever need to throw together a citizen army)

*the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.*

(... Does that portion need a translation? I don't think so.)

So it seems clear to me that ""A Well Regulated Militia"" is one that can be formed by citizens who have guns and other items that a militia member would need. But the gun is such an important part - you can't have a Militia in 1770s without a gun. So to make sure people will have guns - they specifically state in the constitution that the right to keep and bear them will not be infringed.

They don't go as far as to mandate you buy it - Like Obamacare mandates you buy health insurance...

But they do think that making it legal to have them is one of the important changes that are being made by breaking away from English rule. Because English rule was full of laws that infringed on the right to keep and bear arms.",1,0,1444147050,1444718127
cvq7f3g,0,t1_cvq6usm,lannister80,"> well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state

Yes, but now we have a *National Guard* and a *standing army* (we had neither when the 2A was written).   A well-regulated militia is no longer necessary to the security of a free state, IMHO.  So if there's no justification for bearing arms anymore...the amendment is unnecessary.   We don't have militias now, in any real way (other than moldy old laws no one follows).

>So it seems clear to me that ""A Well Regulated Militia"" is one that can be formed by citizens who have guns and other items that a militia member would need.

I thought militias were formed permanently, and were *called up* in times of trouble.  If you were a militia member, you knew your muster point, who would be allowed to ""activate"" the militia, etc.  You don't organize/start the militia up when it's trouble time...right?

cvq9ifm,0,t1_cvq7f3g,Gnome_Sane,"> Yes, but now we have a National Guard and a standing army (we had neither when the 2A was written).

Sure they did. They were the English army. They were British subjects, and the King's army was their army. That is why it is so directly related to the idea of being able to form a militia when needed.

>I thought militias were formed permanently, and were called up in times of trouble. If you were a militia member, you knew your muster point, who would be allowed to ""activate"" the militia, etc. You don't organize/start the militia up when it's trouble time...right?

I do agree, a well regulated militia would also train regularly. I'd say the closest we have is ROTC or National Guard today.

The idea wasn't to force people into anything. It doesn't conscript anyone to a set role in the military. It again is intended to be a local issue on how to organize and train and we adopted the volunteer-with-pay method in times of peace and draft rarely since Vietnam. The important part was the ability to form one, and the best way to respect both freedom and be able to form one was to make guns legal to own.

The start of the revolutionary war was all about gun confiscation. The british marched to Concord to confiscate guns, they didn't find the cannons but found the wooden wheel mounts, took them to the town square and burned them. That turned out to be their big mistake. The rebels saw the smoke and thought the British were burning the town down. They used gorilla warfare tactics to chase the british back to Boston.

All of that is the story of ""the shot heard round the world"". And it is very directly related to the reason the 2nd amendment was so important.

And that was about Cannons.

I appreciate your opinion that is unneeded to the security of the free state today. But I disagree with your idea that the 2nd amendment should be interpreted to only include those in the National Guard or Standing Army. A Militia is a very different concept, and the history and context really spell it out...

From Heller v DC:

> 1  **The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia,** and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2–53.

>  (a) **The Amendment’s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause’s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms.** Pp. 2–22.

> (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court’s interpretation of the operative clause. The “militia” comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens’ militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens’ militia would be preserved. Pp. 22–28.

>  (c) The Court’s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment . Pp. 28–30.

> (d) The Second Amendment ’s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30–32.

> (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court’s conclusion. Pp. 32–47.

> (f) None of the Court’s precedents forecloses the Court’s interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542 , nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252 , refutes the individual-rights interpretation. United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174 , does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.

How else would you do it? If there's no cap on the time the govt has to decide or if it's an automatic fail after some period of time then the government can deny people their rights just by sitting on their hands. Maybe the period should be longer but automatic success after a period of non-action is the only formulation that makes sense.
