For instance we see Scott Walker maintaining fairly strong support, but look what he did to Wisconsin as governor. Kasich has policies that seem very reasonable and line up well with the core beliefs of the Republican party yet we see him getting edged out to the side as people flock behind Trump and Carson, two charismatic men with absolutely zero political experience.

I think a lot of political frustrations come from the way the American system has evolved. It is very difficult to get one's name on the ballot without substantial nepotism and financial backing. Then once on the ballot parties essentially choose their favorite and our country polarizes to vote along party lines and make sure ""the other guy (or gal)"" doesn't win. 

I agree with you that it is insulting and obnoxious when others claim to know what is best for people that they neither know or really understand, but is this frustration entirely unfounded or is it just poorly expressed? People do things all of the time that aren't good for them out of pure ignorance. For instance - the life of a practicing doctor. What do you do when a patient rejects treatment because they ""don't want to take any pills?"". Or when a Jahova witness brings their child in who will die without an organ transplant yet they just want palliative care because they don't believe in transplants? 

Doctors don't yell at their pts when this happens though, and political supporters shouldn't either.

To handicap a student by teaching him that his black face is a curse and that his struggle to change his condition is hopeless is the worst sort of lynching. It kills one's aspirations and dooms him to vagabondage and crime. It is strange, then, that the friends of truth and the promoters of freedom have not risen against the present propaganda in the schools and crushed it. This crusade is much more important than the anti-lynching movement, because there would be no lynching if it did not start in the schoolroom. Why not exploit, enslave, or exterminate a class everybody is taught to regard as inferior!?

When a Negro has finished his education in our schools, then, he has been equipped to begin the life of an Americanized or Europeanized white man, but before he steps from the threshold of his alma mater he is told by his teachers that he must go back to his own people from whom he has been estranged by a vision of ideals which in his disillusionment he will realize that he cannot attain. He goes forth to play his part in life, but he must be both social and bisocial at the same time. while he is a part of the body politic, he is in addition to this a member of a particular race to which he must restrict himself in all matters social. While serving his country he must serve within a special group. While being a good American, he must above all things be a ""good Negro""; and to perform this definite function he must learn to stay in a ""Negro's place.""

These ""educated"" people, however, decry any such thing as race consciousness; and in some respects they are right.

> Work to End Racial Profiling
To help determine where and when racial profiling occurs, Pres. Clinton directed the Departments of Justice, Treasury and Agriculture to collect data on the race, ethnicity, and gender of individuals subject to certain stops by federal law enforcement. 

> Affirmative action: mend it, don’t end it
The Supreme Court rejected the notion that we could ever be separate but equal, and Democrats and Republicans alike passed laws against discrimination and created affirmative action programs to redress centuries of wrongs for minorities and women.

>Shift from group preferences to economic empowerment of all.
Clinton adopted the manifesto, ""A New Agenda for the New Decade"":

Strengthen America’s Common Civic Culture
The more ethnically and culturally diverse America becomes, the harder we must all work to affirm our common civic culture -- the values and democratic institutions we share and that define our national identity as Americans. This means we should resist an “identity politics” that confers rights and entitlements on groups and instead affirm our common rights and responsibilities as citizens. Multiethnic democracy requires fighting discrimination against marginalized groups; empowering the disadvantaged to join the economic, political, and cultural mainstream; and respecting diversity while insisting that what we have in common as Americans is more important than how we differ.

First, demographics and the electoral landscape have changed a lot since 1984, and unlike both 1972 and 1984, there isn't an incumbent Republican president. 

Second, Bernie Sanders isn't as incredibly less popular among non-Democrats as you might think: for example, if you take a look at the recent [Reuters/Ipsos](http://polling.reuters.com/#!response/TR131/type/smallest/filters/PARTY_ID_:1|2|3|4/dates/20150808-20150911/collapsed/false) polling data, you can compare how he performs [among likely Democratic primary voters](http://polling.reuters.com/#!response/TR131/type/smallest/filters/LIKELY_PRIMARY15:1,LIKELYD:1,PARTY_ID_:1/dates/20150808-20150911/collapsed/false) to his performance among [all likely general election voters](http://polling.reuters.com/#!response/TR131/type/smallest/filters/LIKELY:1/dates/20150808-20150911/collapsed/false), and find that his percentages actually improve, while Hillary Clinton's, for example, decline. And in the recent [SurveyUSA poll](http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=d950cadf-05ce-4148-a125-35c0cdab26c6), he lost to Donald Trump by 1 point less than she did, and outperformed Hillary (in matchups against Trump) among 'strong republicans', 'republicans', 'independents, leaning republican', 'independents', and 'strong democrats', as well as among 'very conservative', 'conservative' and 'very liberal' respondents, as well as performing better than her (again, against Trump) in the Midwest as well as the Northeast. I could pull up some more polls I've seen, but generally speaking, from what I've seen, Bernie Sanders doesn't seem to poll all that badly in general election match-ups.

Third, I think you really overestimate the popularity of Hillary Clinton outside the Democratic party. While she has approval ratings of something in the high-70s-to-low-80s among Democrats, her approval among most groups other than 'Democrats' is more like in the [upper-30s-to-lower-40s](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/hillary-clinton-favorable-rating). By my count, that means that her approval rating among non-Democrats is something like 25%; that makes her not really [any more favorable among non-Democrats than the word 'Socialism'](http://reason.com/assets/db/14079740144268.xlsx), as near as I can tell (crosstabs from [this August 2014 poll by the Libertarian Reason foundation](https://reason.com/poll/2014/08/19/august-2014-reason-rupe-national-survey)).

The frank truth is that Hillary Clinton has barely started her campaign.  She's announced, she's been doing some events, but that's about it.  The earlier she starts actually ramping up her campaign, the quicker everyone gets bored of her, so she's keeping it quiet for now.  I figure she'll probably start ramping up around October.

Actually they don't.  I'm serious, they don't.  Also, ""minority"" isn't slang for ""African American"".  Hispanics are also minorities.  

So lets start with ""free college"".  Before you can get into college you have to graduate high school, no?  Well about a quarter of US hispanics stopped formal education at 9th grade to go to work and both hispanics and blacks have massively higher high school drop out rates than whites.  So a much larger proportion of white students benefit from ""free college"" than minority students do since a much larger proportion of white teens graduate high school.

Unless you *ALSO* put in free daycare, push for comprehensive sex ed, and ensure that impoverished students have access to birth control then ""free college"" disproportionately benefits middle class - white - kids.  Clinton did her master's on child development, and her education reform plan isn't just about paying for college, it is also on all the ways people can fall off the education train prior to college.

And Hillary has been passionately involved in all stages of education for her entire life. Back when she was young she did things like pound pavement going from house to house taking surveys to see if reality matched enrollment numbers for the Child Defense Fund.

[Young Hillary Clinton](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/11/hillary-clinton-arkansas_n_7258956.html)

>“I was knocking on doors saying, ‘Is there anybody school-aged who’s not in school?’ and finding blind kids and deaf kids and kids in wheelchairs who were just left out,” she recalled. “And I was able in Arkansas to work and try to improve education there and give more kids chances who really deserved them.”

Bernie has a laser like focus on where the system breaks down for middle class white kids, the paying for college thing.  Hillary has a comprehensive understanding of the entire system from cradle to college and wants to fix not just the middle class white kid problems, but also the problems of the children of migrant farm laborers and the children of single parents working two jobs.

""Because he's a white guy from a white state"" or ""what has done for black people lately"" are nonsense irrelevant ideas when talking about why Clinton is leading so much in the polls. 

After all, nearly all politicians, including Clintons Hillary and Bill, are ""white politicians from white states"", and besides that you could very legitimately ask what Obama has done for black people (who have generally fared poorly while he's been president) , the fact is that every time Sanders has stood up for Medicare, Medicaid, Food Stamps, public insurance, public housing, whatever, even if he didn't frame it in racial terms, that's all stuff that helps the average black person much more than the average white person.

We can't project our college-educated middle class perspective onto black people, even amongst black Democratic primary voters. Their understanding of politics isn't of something that they read about in newspapers, watch on TV, and discuss online like the reddit community, black Democratic primary voters understanding of politics is as something where powerful leaders in their community (preachers, local politicians, union leaders, etc.) will lobby the to vote for a politician based supposedly on what that politician is going to deliver to the community in terms of things like more benefits, more public housing, more union jobs, more patronage jobs, more government contracts to black owned companies, etc, and they will organize buses to take people to the polls, sometimes from nursing homes, public housing, whatever.

This is a common form of politics and not unique to black communities, although most communities grow out of it as they get wealthier and more established. For example, the Irish communities of 19th century New York City operated pretty much the same way, as did many ethnic minority communities as they were first arriving.

So the reason that black voters are shunning Sanders is because the Clinton political operation already has longstanding ties with all of these black community leaders around the country, with a proven track record of delivering them jobs, pork, contracts, whatever. Also, if these black community leaders are smart, they'll realize that the Clintons have no qualms about enriching private individuals who are helping them politically, whereas Sanders is more idealistic and would prefer to see the benefits of his policies going straight to poor people rather than, for example, giving contracts to black-owned enterprises where the money will theoretically trickle down to the black employees.",40,0,1442169532,1444729607

Not really. Hilary is from Chicago, and represented NY, which both have large minority areas. Bill was the governor of Arkansas in two different decades, a state that has almost as large of a black minority population as the entire population of Vermont.

Arkansas, Illinois and NY, all three places where the Clintons hail from, have a black minority population of 14-16%, above the national average, and 12-13-14 in the rankings of states. Whereas Vermont registers at the 49th state with a black population, of about .8%. The only state worse than Vermont for having a black population is Montana. But in Montana, there is a  4x larger hispanic population, than the percentage of all minorities in VT. Vermont is literally the whitest state in the Union, and Sanders is literally one of the whitest politicians running for president. Hell, even Ted Cruz managed to get a larger vote from black people, and hispanics, than there is all minorities combined in Vermont.

Both Clintons have represented larger black minorities, than almost the entire population of Vermont, and have actually done more for the black minority than Sanders has. Sanders has never had more than 6,000 black constituents to  represent. Whereas both Clintons represented at minimum 350,000 black people. At the most fundamental level, Sanders is an old white progressive politician, has never had to deal with any of the issues black communities face, and is falling flat on his face when trying to deal with them.

There is also the pesky fact that Sanders has literally called to reinstate Jim Crow laws. Has called for poll taxes that disenfranchise mainly minority populations. And, has called for laws the same groups that he marched with, have called ""the worst form of racism.""

Sanders, instead of engaging with the black population and seeing what they want, has basically told them his extremely progressive policies are what they need to fix their problems, without having any actual governing experience with those same problems. Its exactly those idealistic policies of Sanders, is why he is not connecting with black minorities, because he isn't listening to them, he's telling them, without having any actual experience.",4,0,1442208357,1444729607

A poll tax is defined as charging money to exercise a right.

Asking the government for permission to own a gun, [was literally some of the first Jim Crow laws.](http://www.davekopel.org/2A/Mags/dark-secret-of-jim-crow.html) Sanders pushes for laws that by his own definition are a poll tax, and calls for bringing back racist Jim Crow laws of the past.

Also, Sanders has called to [ban guns you can't hunt with.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-guns_55b54b5fe4b0a13f9d18e1a5) This would basically be handguns, cheap handguns that poor minorities can afford. Being a Bernie supporter, you should know that it's wildly said that Sanders has been involved in the civil rights area. [The group he was most involved in working with was CORE.](http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/20-examples-bernie-sanders-powerful-record-civil-and-human-rights-1950s) Which is hilarious, as the laws Sanders pushes for, and has voted for, have been called [""racism in it's worst form.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_night_special#Economic_class_and_racial_inequality) literally by Presidents of CORE. 

What's hilarious about this, is that Reddit has been bitching daily for the last few weeks about some politician trying to go against SCOTUS decisions, where they are absolutely mum on the fact that Sanders pushes for laws, like banning all guns not used for hunting, [despite several SCOTUS decisions saying that's unconstitutional.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller)

Seriously, he has called for laws, [that directly go against the first ""civil rights"" laws we had.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedmen%27s_Bureau_bills)

Sanders has called for poll taxes, while speaking against them. Sanders has called for Jim Crow laws, while speaking against them.
Sanders has called for laws described as the groups he marched with as racist. Sanders has called for laws that have already been found unconstitutional by SCOTUS numerous times.

cv1ax7i,0,t1_cv18kvn,YankeeQuebec,"Well, since you're being extremely pedantic, you should know that the term ""poll tax"" has been used to generically define payments as a precursor to exercise a right. This isn't just my definition, but it's been long standing court decisions.

The term is not only used for actually voting, but many people on the left have [actually called anti abortion laws literal poll taxes.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ian-reifowitz/trap-laws-restrict-aborti_b_4696354.html)

But, getting back to something that has more standing, Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections, is what struck down poll taxes. In that court decision, the courts refereed to Murdock v Pennsylvania. In that case, the court decided that paying a fee to the government as requirement to exercise your right, is in fact an unconstitutional practice.  So, in legal standing, asking a person to pay a fee to exercise any right, can be considered a ""poll tax.""

In Sanders own words, asking for an ID to exercise your right to vote is a poll tax, which means that asking for an ID to exercise your other rights, would also be considered the same exact thing. By that connection, since owning a gun is an enumerated right (of which voting isn't), charging a fee to practice that right can, and is considered a poll tax in longer legal standing.

Ignoring all that, since you're going off of specific meanings of words, the Oxford Dictionary defines ""poll tax"" as

>[A tax levied on every adult, without reference to income or resources.](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/poll-tax)

with absolutely no reference to voting. 

Just so you know, definitions that the Oxford Dictionary provides, [have been used to decide SCOTUS cases.](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/us/14bar.html?_r=0) Actually, the Oxford suite of references, [have been some of the most used references with not only SCOTUS, but in all federal court cases.](http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/supreme-court-and-circuit-court-dictionary-use)

To go even more in depth, Blacks Law references are the standard legal references used by SCOTUS, and by all courts. The definition of ""poll tax"" in Blacks makes absolutely no reference to voting, but as a general tax that effects everyone the same without references to the wealth.

>[A capitation tax; a tax of a specific sum levied upon each person with in the jurisdiction of the taxing power and within a certain class (as, all males of a cer- tain age, etc.) without reference to his property or lack of it.](http://thelawdictionary.org/poll-tax/)

Not only that, but the references to court cases involving ""poll tax"" in the Blacks legal dictionary point to several cases that do not involve taxes on voting, but taxing entities for other things, often not even for enumerated rights.

I literally provided you several ways in which Sanders has called for racist laws, poll taxes, and for bringing Jim Crow laws back, and you ignore all that by issuing an ad hominem attack against me. And then, even your attempt at belittling my knowledge is extremely baseless, and flat out wrong.

Hillary, by contrast, can say everything Bernie can say ( including meeting Dr King and marching with him ) and can also say:

* In college she got a grant to spend the summer criss crossing the nation looking for migrant farm laborers to survey them about access to sanitation, healthcare, and education, compiling the data into a report used by Walter Mondale to argue for better protections for migrant laborers.

* Both throughout college and as a practicing lawyer she volunteered with charities that gave free legal aid to the indigent and impoverished - populations that are disproportionately minority - so that they could bring lawsuits against people abusing them.  Our constitution guarantees everyone a legal defense, but not a legal *offense*, which allows for substantial abuse of folks who can't afford to bring lawsuits against their abusers.

* In high school Hillary regularly volunteered with her church group to provide free day care to low income, mostly minority, families so that both parents could work minimum wage jobs trying to feed their families, staring poverty directly in the face.

* As FLOTUS Hillary lead an initiative to raise the minimum wage, and successfully did so in 1996 - the last time the minimum wage was raised.  Bernie voted for her initiative but didn't organize it or whip votes across the aisle to get it passed.

* As First Lady of Arkansas Hillary Clinton held town halls in every county to get feedback to devise a plan to improve their school system.  She then successfully lobbied for her plan and got the legislature to pass it, [substantially increasing funding to impoverished schools that were largely minority](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/hillary-clinton-2016-arkansas-116939).  

* As FLOTUS when Hillary's first push for health care reform failed ( single payer /swoon ) she rallied and was able to get SCHIP passed instead.  SCHIP is single payer government health care for impoverished children, a group that is largely minority.  [Nearly half of African American children and over a third of hispanic children receive public health insurance ](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/23/5/171.full).

They didn't rely on Bernie and he didn't work with them.  He did the bare minimum, voting ""aye"", and thats all.

~In a stunning upset in 1981, Sanders wins the mayoral race in Burlington, Vermont's largest city, by a mere 10 votes. Running as an independent, he shocks the city's political establishment by defeating a six-term, local machine mayor.

~During his tenure as mayor, he balanced the city budget, drew a minor league baseball team to Burlington, turned the formerly industrial waterfront into a mixed-use district featuring housing, parks, and public space. Burlington is now reported to be one of the most livable cities in the nation.

~In 1991, he was the first independent elected to the House in 40 years. He will be re-elected by the people of Vermont to serve eight terms.

~Votes against a measure providing President George H. W. Bush with authorization to use military force in the Gulf War. ""I have a real fear that the region is not going to be more peaceful or more stable after the war,"" he says at the time.

~Co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus and chaired the group for its first 8 years.

~In 1992, Congress passes Sanders' first signed piece of legislation to create the National Program of Cancer Registries. All 50 states now run registries to help cancer researchers gain important insights.

~Voted against the Clinton-era North American Free Trade Agreement, which we now know sent millions of American jobs overseas.

~Sanders is one of only 67 votes against the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples legally married. It took 17 years to overturn this Act.

~Standing up against the major pharmaceutical companies, Sanders becomes the first member of Congress to take seniors across the border to Canada to buy lower-cost prescription drugs. The congressman continues his bus trips to Canada with a group of breast cancer patients the following April. These women are able to purchase their medications in Canada for almost one-tenth the price charged in the States.

~Thanks to Sanders' efforts, IBM agreed to a $320 million legal settlement with some 130,000 IBM workers and retirees.

~About 10 years before the 2008 Wall Street crash spins the world economy into a massive recession, Sanders votes ""no"" on a bill to undo decades of financial regulations enacted after the Great Depression. The House passed the bill 362-57 over Sanders' objection.

~Sanders votes against the USA Patriot Act. ""All of us want to protect the American people from terrorist attacks, but in a way that does not undermine basic freedoms,"" Sanders says at the time.

~Sanders votes against the Bush-Cheney war in Iraq. He warns at the time that an invasion could ""result in anti-Americanism, instability and more terrorism."" We now know that that war was one of the worst foreign policy decisions in our history.

~Sanders passes an amendment in the House to stop the government from obtaining library and book-buying records on Americans.

~Sanders defeats Vermont's richest man, Rich Tarrant, to be elected to the U.S. Senate. Sanders, running as an Independent, is endorsed by the Vermont Democratic Party and supported by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

~Sanders' authored energy efficiency and conservation grant program passes into law. He later secures $3.2 billion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the grant program.

~Thanks to Sanders' efforts, funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funding doubles, helping millions of low-income Americans heat their homes in winter.

~Sanders works with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to pass an amendment to an economic recovery bill preventing Wall Street banks that take taxpayer bailouts from replacing laid-off U.S. workers with exploited and poorly-paid foreign workers.

~Sanders passes language in the Affordable Care Act to allow states to apply for waivers to implement pilot health care systems by 2017. The legislation allows states to adopt more comprehensive systems to cover more people at lower costs.

~In 2010, President Barack Obama signs into law the Affordable Care Act with a major Sanders provision to expand federally qualified community health centers. Sanders secures $12.5 billion in funding for the program which now serves more than 25 million Americans. Another $1.5 billion from a Sanders provision went to the National Health Service Corps for scholarships and loan repayment for doctors and nurses who practice in underserved communities.

~Sanders works with Republican Congressman Ron Paul in the House to pass a measure as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill to audit the Federal Reserve, revealing how the independent agency gave $16 trillion in near zero-interest loans to big banks and businesses after the 2008 economic collapse.

~In 2012, he becomes Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.

~Sanders, backed by seniors, women, veterans, labor unions and disabled Americans leads a successful effort to stop a ""chained-CPI"" proposal supported by Congressional Republicans and the Administration to cut Social Security and disabled veterans' benefits.

~A bipartisan $16.5 billion veterans bill written by Sanders, Sen. John McCain and Rep. Jeff Miller is signed into law by President Barack Obama.

~In 2015, Sanders takes over as ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, using the platform to fight for his economic agenda for the American middle class.

What is this a hop scotch song, why are you acting like this is some middle school student elections? You've got an awfully long winded post that contains absolutely no substance to prove your point against Sanders.  The fact that you have to present him in a such an obvious bias to make your case for Clinton is very telling.

And not for nothing, didn't Hillary work for Barry Goldwater's 1964 Presidential Campaign? The guy who voted agains the Voting Rights Act?  Right around the time Sanders was organizing a sit in at University of Chicago to protest the segregation of student housing, and when he marched with MLK in our nation's capitol to hear his I Have A Dream Speech. Not to mention, this was around the time the Selma-Montgomery marches were happening and MLK and John Lewis put the pressure on for the Voting Rights Act to pass thanks to the Selma-Montgomery marches they organized. 

Oh, and this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayqmhfwEURY Greg Palast talks about how he was asked by the Congressional Black Caucus to present his discovery of the illegal purge of Black voters in Florida, and notes how only one white guy showed: Bernie Sanders. Hillary was a Senator at the time, nowhere to be seen. 

But hey, I dont have to compare Sanders to Hillary to explain why I support Sanders.  He stand on his own merits, so I'll stop stooping to your level.
He's has a consistent voting record in favor of working class Americans, not bending to the will of corporate influence.
Throughout his 35 years as a career politician he has been hell bent on restoring the American Dream to working class Americans as we were sold out by one free trade agreement after the next and saw our wages stagnate for years and saw our tax dollars go to subsidies for wealthy multi-national corporation.  Instead of marginalizing the exploited working class, he stood against the brutal corruption.  
Slander Sanders all you want, his integrity and character are bullet proof. and I for one, want a candidate who stands for working class Americans consistently.  He's not resorting to mud slinging Hillary, so I don't understand why you've felt it so necessary to try so hard to sling mud at Slanders.

Yeah they do, because the ones who do have jobs can now spend more of their money and they can revitalize the economy. They will also pay more into taxes which will provide for more inner city programs.

For the past 30+ years, Democrats have been voting for ""the black dream"" via economic expansion which has only worked to further push down lower income people stuck in a poverty trap.  Democrats don't seem to have any idea how things actually work...

IE ""$15 / HOUR MINIMUM WAGE WILL HELP BLACKS""... no what it will do is create a downward spiral where better educated people in that minimum-$15 range who previously would not have taken those jobs are now willing to take those jobs.  Blacks, who have notoriously poor education rates coming from poor school systems, will be shoved out of those jobs by those from better areas (classically white).  This is how reality works, and sadly for Berniebots it doesn't always have a liberal bias.

Blacks believe that until the underlying systems CAN be fixed, such as their terrible school systems, horrible economic outlooks in the predominantly black areas, and poor reputations with criminal justice, that there should be protections in place to ""even the odds"".

This should hopefully drop college prices dramatically as according to the supply/demand concept.

Had you said that people vote for the best candidate, then I would be agreeing.  Instead, you said it was skin color.   Not sure how that's ""making an issue"".  Just a response to what you said.

I didn't say anything about voting.  African Americans are going to vote democrat no matter what.  The question was why sanders doesn't have support- the answer is that a vocal minority in the black community is motivated by racism and that an even broader demographic of that community tolerates and embraces the racist minority.  The simple fact is that the same exact policies coming out of a black person's mouth would be welcomed an endorsed by the whole community.  ",-4,0,1442171971,1444729659

Otherwise, I really don't see Hillary getting the black vote over him for reasons of discussion I've actually had with black friends of mine who voted for Obama twice. They simply don't think that Hillary is strong enough to lead the country, for reasons of her gender and he past experiences. They think Bill got her everything she has right now.

The biggest internal danger to the Democratic Party is the way they treat minorities. Too often we simply expect them to turn out and vote for us without doing much to reward them for being in the coalition. We tend not to speak to the issues of minority communities in terms they recognize, but the inertia of history keeps them basically in the party. 

For what it's worth, the GOP has this same problem with libertarians. The GOP has grown the size of government and routinely endorses invasive, anti-civil liberty measures. But they take the libertarian vote for granted, because where else would they go? 

But that's a pretty shitty approach to politics. Black people should vote for Bernie because if they don't they stupid. Soaring rhetoric. ",6,0,1442171786,1444729663
