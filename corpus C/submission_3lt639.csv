3lt639,What would Democrats oppose so fiercely they would be willing to shut down the government as the GOP is trying to do with Planned Parenthood over abortions?,33,garfangle,"Democrats say that Republicans are too extreme because they'd rather have the government shut down than fund Planned Parenthood over their opposition to funding the group that provides abortion services. However, what policy or idea would get Democrats so angry that they'd be willing to shut down the government in order to stop it from funding a program they disliked?

For example:

If the government underwrote the purchase of guns by citizens?

If the government provided a subsidy to private high schools, including religious schools (aka school choice)?

If the government funded gay conversion therapy?

If the government massively increased spending toward fossil fuel companies?

If the government gave Operation Rescue (a pro-life group) a billion dollar grant from the NIH?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lt639/what_would_democrats_oppose_so_fiercely_they/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442846529,1444726079
