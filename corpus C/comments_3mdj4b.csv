>Never has there been an economist who has advocated for trickle-down economics as in, giving the wealthy more money will be beneficial because a greater amount of wealth will trickle down to the bottom. Never, not once. In fact, I challenge you to find me one economist who actually said such a thing ever, not any second hand bullshit, but an actual economist who makes such a proposal with that exact intention (as an aside, if anyone here can find an economist directly making such a claim, I think that would be amazing. I was obviously venting my frustration a bit here and may have been a tad hyperbolic, but I am genuinely unaware of such claims as presented).
Instead, what you will find is that at various times and places some economists have argued tax rates have been so high, that increased tax revenues could actually be raised, because changed incentives would result in more tax revenues out of rising taxable incomes.

>This is the Laffer Curve, and although the Laffer Curve seems to be much higher than what your typical Republican would advocate (at least pre-Bush tax cuts), the core concept is well rooted and observable in economics.
""Nor should the argument seem strange that taxation may be so high as to defeat its object, and that, given sufficient time to gather the fruits, a reduction of taxation will run a better chance, than an increase, of balancing the Budget.""

>Do you know who said that? John Maynard Keynes (pg. XI), the founder of modern macroeconomics and someone far flung from your prototypical Republican.

>When Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon pointed out in the early XXth century that the government could increase its tax revenues because tax rates where far too high, it had nothing to do with ""trickle-down theory,"" though it has not been presented that way.

>The Kennedy tax cuts (note, also not a Republican), observed a similar effect of increased revenues from lowering taxes, when the top marginal rate was XCI and he lowered it to like LXX percent at the top I believe.

cve9lna,1,t3_3mdj4b,Hevil,"No real formal economics knowledge, but my basic understanding is this; supply side policies increase the basic productive capacity of the economy.

So, the economy has so many people, buildings, natural resources and machinery that allow it to produce a certain amount of goods and services each year. The actual amount of that capacity used will vary as the overall level of demand changes, as demand is much more volatile than supply. Supply side policies are those that are meant to increase that productive capacity. Usually, this is interpreted as meaning deregulation, as in theory deregulation will allow existing resources to be used more efficiently, however a number of other policies, such as spending on infrastructure and education can also be interpreted as supply side. Essentially demand-side policies can only go so far, as they are limited by the physical capacity of the economy, but supply-side policies ought to increase the long-term growth of the economy.

Trickle-down economics simply states that a reduction in the burden on the upper-classes will come to benefit the lower classes. The association with supply-side policies is this; generally, only the rich invest. Note invest here doesn't really mean financial investment (stocks, bonds etc.), but spending that increases the productive capacity of the economy, which means spending money on new machinery, training etc. This is because the poor, and even middle classes can not/do not defer consumption (basically invest in the future). So, if you make the rich richer (say by cutting taxes), they will invest more, and thus the overall supply of the economy will grow faster. In theory.

Basically, supply-side policies aren't necessarily to do with taxes cuts although the argument is often framed that way.",2,0,1443221036,1444723689
cve4myt,1,t3_3mdj4b,maddata,"First : Trickle Down Economics is only a straw man.

There is no such thing as ""Trickle Down Economics"", the straw man it represents used to be called ""Horse and Sparrow"".

----

""Supply Side"", which some people think is useless and outdated thinks that:

If you increase demand, things get much more expensive but not much extra is produced.

If you increase supply, things get slightly less expensive but a lot more is produced.

So your policy should focus on encouraging people to work and invest (low income and gains taxes), not using the government to encourage people to spend more or having the government spend more (since more demand doesn't really effect how much is made), not using government monetary policy to try and offset recessions (again, since printing money -> increasing demand will not lead to very much increased production) but instead using monetary policy to have some small inflation.

Basically: The amounts produced are more important than the amount demanded -> ""If you build it they will come""

-----

To contrast, Keynsian thoery (which is popular with the gov't and the fed) think that:

Keynsian economics thinks that increasing demand is far more impact than increasing supply in changing economic output.

People's behavior is controlled by ""Animal Spirits"" which influence their tendency to spend or save

These Animal Spirit induced mood swings cause boom and bust cycles (busts are caused when people are saving too much -> not spending (low demand) -> low production)

The government has a special job to use monetary policy to 'dampen' those cycles.

The government can increase demand during recessions by increasing spending, since it's spending is counted in overall demand.  The Government can also use the Fed rates to make it more expensive or less expensive for banks to lend money to one another.  By making it more profitable for banks to lend money you can increase the amount of money people have to spend, which has a strong effect on increasing economic output.

Basically:  The gov't can use spending and monetary policy to control the aggregate demand in the economy, which has a strong effect on increasing economic output.

-----

Anyways that's a gist of it, and there are many nuances, omissions, and mistakes.

An interesting thought experiment:

If we all got stranded on an island, with nothing:

* Interpreting Keynsianism, you would conclude low aggregate demand would cause very little economic output to exist, and nobody would be trying to produce anything extra to barter/sell with one another (since nobody has a surplus of anything)

* Interpreting supply side, you would conclude that people would try to make 'extra' and start trading/selling what they can among each other, since spontaneous extra supply would increase demand.

Cap and trade is a pay to play scheme. It works when there is technology to replace the bad gas like with chlorofluorocarbons. Cab and trade with carbon right now is just a way to extract additional tax. It will not stop behavior. 

>increase use of renewables....I could go on

The renewable and clean tech  is not there yet (except for nuclear). To just meet new energy demand each year would require a solar farm the size of Italy.

No.

This was not a response to cost of energy. This was a response to the claim that the tech didn't exist..it does..

>The renewable and clean tech is not there yet (except for nuclear). 

Yes it is...any combination of the existing tech could replace coal tomorrow....it all comes down to cost. Coal is cheap...coal is dirty. It is all in the choice pay me now or pay me latter ....But this is not about energy and global warming...this is about CATO.

CATO's entire propose is to reduce the size and power of government....they take opinions on a lot of topics but their overriding concern is smaller government,,,and everything they say supports that.....facts or the lack of them are just a way to justify existing philosophy

No - it is not just about cost. Wind and solar sources could only logistically replace about 20% of our current consumption increases. If we build wind resources enough to replace coal there would not be a safe place for birds to fly. It would take a solar surface the size of Africa and battery installations the size of western europe to replace coal.  ",1,0,1443371347,1444723692

cveu48f,1,t3_3mdj4b,mrhymer,Economists and politicians do not control the economy. The economy is a simple voluntary mechanism that exists naturally if you just leave people alone. Economists without politicians are weathermen that try to predict the future with math. When money and interest rates are not controlled and left to the market there is very little value in what economists do. When politicians exert force on the economy they hire economists to convince people their intervention is a good and normal. It's like if the old traveling flim flam men hired respected scientists to legitimize their useless potions and cure alls.,-1,0,1443280355,1444723692
