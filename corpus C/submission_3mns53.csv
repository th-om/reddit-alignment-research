3mns53,Some notes on money and politics from a former lobbyist. Y'all might learn something. I want to know if politicians are still routing cash to each other.,37,JimMarch,"I was a registered state lobbyist in California from 2003-2005.  I worked for a specific non-profit whose work I was already active in; I earned $1,000/mo plus had access to an apartment right across from the state capital building worth maybe $800/mo max at the time.

I had zero money to give or direct to politicians.  While it isn't relevant to what I have to say here, full disclosure is I worked for a smaller offshoot of the NRA.

Brief history lesson first: for well over 20 years a state legislator name of Willie Brown dominated state politics, more than any governor.  How?  Well he had a total lock on his home base in San Francisco - he was going to get re-elected more or less no matter what barring a really crazy scandal.

He could thus take in campaign money from ""evil sources"" - big tobacco, major polluters, logging companies, etc.  And he did.  He then re-distributed this money to other legislators who would then be able to say they never took that kind of loot...and that Willie then owned.  Willie played this game better than anybody, ever.  The state finally got a term limits law passed for the main unstated purpose of finally ditching Willie Brown.  Yes, he was a Dem but I don't think that matters.

In 1998 another Dem won governor - Gray Davis.  Realizing he had less time in office than Willie had, he seems to have tried to copy Willie's techniques, or maybe he had another reason for turning into an absolute fiend for campaign money.  If you wanted to see him it would cost you.  If you wanted to see his *staffers* it would cost you - less of course, but you still needed to show up wallet in hand.

When Davis did nothing when an artificially created energy crisis hit along with the tech bubble collapse he got recalled and we got Ahnuld the Governator instead.

To his credit, Arnold ended that pay-for-access shit.  Immediately.  I am a living witness to what access to his staff was like.  They didn't always ensure Arnold went our way of course, but we could talk to them and submit short (for best results) position papers without any hint money was involved.  Late in my tenure I became interested in the problems with electronic voting and knowing this unpaid side-interest of mine, his staff asked my input on a couple of bills without me even trying to contact them on that subject.

And they knew I had zero cash to kick around.

Arnold did not act as a money redirector to other candidates, which is likely why he was the last gasp the California GOP had.  They are now basically irrelevant in that state.

Does anybody know of other ""redirector"" cases like Willie, or has the rise of PACs made that trick obsolete?  Was Boehner doing that?",91,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mns53/some_notes_on_money_and_politics_from_a_former/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443413609,1444723041
