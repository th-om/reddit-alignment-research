Rhetoric aside, I can't really see where there is any weight to your argument.

Explained better [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/3kykfi/rage_against_the_cpi_part_2077_the_chapwood_index/?):

>The CPI at its heart is still a very simple process. Several thousand households are asked to keep track of their expenditure. Thousands of retailers and landlords are also surveyed. The products are weighted by the average proportion spent on that product. That's key to take a change in a big ticket item bought rarely from changing the index unrealistically. A few items are quality adjusted with simple formula, the rent formula is simply adjusted to make older homes more expense to account for lower probabe quality. That change, if anything inflates the CPI a bit.

>Then there's seasonal variations. Anyone who has tried booking flights or hotels knows those variations are pretty predictable within a product.

>So the CPI is still basically a survey with a few simple adjustments. Nothing hidden there.

On a more serious note if you examine the strength od the economy at more depth than just stock market performance, the Obama recovery has been pretty poor. Incomes aren't increasing very much, more live in poverty, people have checked out of the workforce (not like the raw stats with no context would suggest, but it's happening), company's revenues aren't growing and more businesses are going out of business than there are starting.
