3la1rr,Planned Parenthood,60,cnnthrowawaynfl,"Just to place my cards on the table. I'm fairly liberal, but I grew up in a conservative family. Thus, I feel like I can see more moderately on a lot of issues.

During tonight's debate and the last one, I found myself cringing each time the republicans mention Planned Parenthood. It's just so clear they are destroying all credibility with their hatred of this organization. But, in light of Cruz's plea to watch these videos I did. I know this will sound like a republican troll, but frankly I'm very surprised and somewhat alarmed. I stand by the right of ANY woman to get an abortion, but this practice of selling fetuses is fucked up and illegal.

I understand why republicans want to use this as an excuse to get rid of planned parenthood. I understand, which is not to say, agree. Here's what I don't understand. Why hasn't ANY liberal come out and condemned this practice? Maybe I missed it if they did, but to my knowledge it's just a general disgust that anyone would make fault with planned parenthood. Please tell me someone is championing reform.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3la1rr/planned_parenthood/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442477756,1444727692
