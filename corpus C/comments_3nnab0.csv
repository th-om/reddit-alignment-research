As for historians I think it is too easy to label them as liberal because they view history with an open mind and without the American Exceptionalism that is standard in k-12 education. Especially when working with different frameworks of history that don't focus on the ""Great Person"" like George Washington or Edison. This offends Republicans because their heroes aren't prominently displayed and worshiped like they were in K-12 education.

Engineers I think are probably more balanced since many are more tied to industry but it's hard for me to tell. I can't find any data on it.

I think part of the reasoning is that academia challenges ideas, they explore and try and find a truth or greater understanding of things.

>But Inbar and Lammers (2012) found that most social psychologists who responded to their survey were willing to explicitly state that they would discriminate against conservatives.  Their survey posed the question: ""If two job candidates (with equal qualifications) were to apply for an opening in your department, and you knew that one was politically quite conservative, do you think you would be inclined to vote for the more liberal one?” Of the 237 liberals, only 42 (18%) chose the lowest scale point, “not at all.”  In other words, 82% admitted that they would be at least a little bit prejudiced against a conservative candidate, and 43% chose the midpoint (“somewhat”) or above. In contrast, the majority of moderates (67%) and conservatives (83%) chose the lowest scale point (“not at all”).

>Not only is the paper you linked insanely weak, as it relies on self-reported questionaires about bias and has absolutely no control for confounders such as quality of papers or difference in self-reporting, it also shows no evidence of individual discrimination actually happening.

Questionnaires and surveys are *routinely* used in the field of social study, and there absolutely is evidence of discrimination in hiring, grant awards, and publishing.  That you choose to ignore it only serves to reinforce the point of the paper.

>The only thing you can confidently say with your article is that liberal-leaning academics are more likely to report a real or imagined bias in themselves against conservatives.  There is no evidence of actual discrimination happening against ""conservative job applicants""...

Besides the 20:1 liberal-to-conservative ratio in academia?  Funny, because such disparities are usually hailed by social psychologists as evidence of sexual or racial discrimination in other fields.  How convenient that it doesn't apply to themselves!

>...and the evidence for discrimination against ""conservative grant applications"" is very weak, as it relies on one study that found that proposals on ""conventional discrimination"" were more likely to be approved than proposals on ""reverse discrimination"".

Someone didn't read my second link, this happens all the time.

>Then, it only mentions ""everything else about the proposals was held constant"", which is simply a ridiculous way to claim the results were trustworthy. Did they control for quality? Maybe the research on conventional discrimination is more broad and has more consequences? Isn't conventional discrimination more relevant, as it is more common? There is absolutely nothing in that result that can lead us to the conclusion that the difference in approval rates was due to ""liberal bias"". 

This is such bullshit.  How else do you eliminate the variables?  There's no way to accurately control for ""quality,"" because *as it just so happens*, ""quality"" (like so many other things in the laughable attempt to christen social studies as ""science"") is subjective.  What makes one study ""of higher quality"" than another study?  Larger dataset?  Well, they couldn't change the dataset size, because they would need to hold everything else constant.  If this study were showing the reverse, you'd be holding it up and screaming bloody murder at conservatives.

>You might as well claim there is a liberal bias against the flat earth theory because grant proposals wanting to investigate it don't get approved as much as conventional earth proposals. 

It's almost as if psychology isn't a hard science like physics and chemistry, and produces results which are highly susceptible to the biases of the human beings studying them.  Unlike physics and chemistry, there is no objective other party to eliminate bias from the researchers.

>That 83% percent of conservative-leaning academics claim to be ""not at all"" biased is laughably unlikely, and probably a lie.
