Nope.  It has nothing to do with a ""reasonable amount of money.""  This is all very simple.  They cannot recoup more than the cost of the donation.  Anything beyond that is illegal.  

Moreover, it does not have to be offset against the total funding of the organization- as you seemed to erroneously believe.  
  
>What was your argument then? That medical costs are unreasonable at a couple hundred dollars??? Hahaha that's the cheapest medical treatment I've ever heard of.

Nope.  My argument is that we have a recording of a planned parenthood exec explicitly saying they would be willing to ""do better"" than just recoup the costs of the donation, which is illegal.

Edit:  Here is the quote in question,

don’t want to—they want to break even. **And if they can do a little better

No, there won't be any court cases.  There is absolutely no doubt that they can only recoup the cost of the donation.  However, the cost of the donation is usually an estimate of some kind because of overhead and a bunch of things that aren't easy to quantify.

Why is that a valid argument against this but, not against the Tyson videos?

And yes Tyson kills chickens, just like PP aborts fetuses. Both are often times much less pleasant to view than one would like to admit. 

Tyson works with more independent farms than there are PP in the country. ~700 PP facilities compared to [~11,000 farms working for tyson (4,000 chicken, 4,000 beef, 3,000 pork)](http://www.tysonfoods.com/our-story/farmers.aspx). Clearly you will run into more poorly managed workers in such a large scale. 

Then for the sickly looking chickens shown in many of these videos. Tyson goes through [~41,000,000 chickens a week](http://ir.tyson.com/investor-relations/investor-overview/tyson-factbook/), or 2 trillion chickens a year. I'm guessing some of them will have deformities.

 * episodic content released by CMP which:
  * is widely consumed and distributed

The easy answer to this would be for the group releasing the video to offer to give out the full, unaltered footage.

Not really.
