Lying is not an impeachable offense. Per Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution:

> The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, **Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors**.

Two questions arise from this: Did Bill Clinton lie? Is his ""lie"" about a sexual encounter considered *High Crimes or Misdemeanors*?

But the bigger question to myself and others was: Why should we care about a politician's personal life? Granted, it's not a rosy situation, but we have bigger issues to solve as a country than to concern ourselves with a little affair.",3,0,1443290963,1444723394
