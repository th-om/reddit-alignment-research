3kpeew,"Why are the majority of true moral examples (Biden, Carter, Dukakis) from the Democratic party? And who are the equivalents in the Republican party?",18,Pugilanthropist,"Granted, this has an ideological tint, sorry about that. And it's a controversial question that will inevitably start arguments. Not my intent, but really just a topic I wanted to consider.

I just caught the Biden interview with Colbert from this week, and found my heart bursting at just how genuine of a person the Vice President seems to be. The way he downplayed his own accomplishments and kept returning the conversation to his son was so heartfelt, real and admirable. Furthermore, just last month, former President Carter gave a true example of what dignity and grace looks like in the face of death. Then, on top of all that, [I learned the story of Michael Dukakis and the way he and his wife are fighting for redefining the conversation around shock therapy.](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/dukakis-depression-treatment-campaign-213116)

If I go back beyond those two recent examples, I think to Bobby Kennedy, and I am admittedly a huge Barack Obama fanboy (status as the first President to visit a federal prison the latest example of why I admire him so).

Anyways, I realize I come from a wheelhouse, but all I can really think of in the Republican party is Abraham Lincoln and to a lesser extent Ron Paul. So I was wondering who has the same sort of emotional appeal (apolitical, talking more about the integrity and character side of things) in the Republican party past and present?

And if there aren't solid examples, why is that?

Serious question, not trying to start a flame war.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kpeew/why_are_the_majority_of_true_moral_examples_biden/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442090651,1444729749
