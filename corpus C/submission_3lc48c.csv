3lc48c,Is anyone else not impressed for Carli Fiorina?,60,ZenerDiod,"The main points I got from here were:

Negatives:

- She wants to increase an already bloated military budget and is very hawkish

- She made up stuff about planned parenthood videos, and can put a good emotional response of indignation when she needs to.

- She can actually land a punch on Trump due to the social protection of being a women, notice how the audience clapped along when Trump made fun of Rand's looks 10 minutes earlier but thought her response was brilliant.

- Completely forgettable on taxes and immigration.

- Has a very low likability in terms of mannerisms and demeanor, I can actually see what Trump mean't.

- Pandering response about the currency question, because women aren't a special interest group, they can't be on the bill?

- Lied blatantly about her business record.

Positives:

+ She's clearly pretty smart, and a decent speaker.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lc48c/is_anyone_else_not_impressed_for_carli_fiorina/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442516532,1444727342
