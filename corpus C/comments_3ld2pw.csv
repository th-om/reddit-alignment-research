How? 

Are you implying that higher interest rates would encourage the opposite?",2,0,1442531684,1444727331

cv5ekva,1,t3_3ld2pw,Risk_Neutral,"Well rates are lower to counter balance a recession that happened a few years ago. During a recession money isn't moving throughout the economy so workers can be quite useless if no one is buying anything. If money is moving, there is a demand for more jobs. This isn't the same thing as trickle down economics.",2,0,1442541003,1444727331
cv5ca4s,1,t3_3ld2pw,AMatterofTrust,"It has nothing to do with automation. 

The fed is holding back on raising rates because it feels that globally (AFAIK) there are economic problems, China the most recent, the eurp a while back. The fed will raise rates eventually, as the economy is growing (who is part of that growth is not up to fed but our elected representatives) and it has to balance inflation with growth. 

I don't know what automation has to do with it, most economics regard automation, in the short term ans in the long term, as a non-issue. If not a non-issue, then an issue that has an easy solution, encourage people to adapt, as they always have. And if people are borrowing more for their business, **that is good. Not bad. Good.** That causes the economy to grow. I fail to see how that could possibly be a bad thing with regards to what they are borrowing. I can be a bad thing because of inflation and savers, but the fed has said, today, given what is happening around the world, it is not. ",1,0,1442537161,1444727331

I take this as 'education', which means loans to students, and crazy profits for universities.  

. . . and if students / their families freely choose *the right thing*, they might even be able to pay off the loans.  ",1,0,1442625221,1444727331
cv6izm6,0,t1_cv6ie67,AMatterofTrust,"College still brings more than it costs. People are enrolling in college in higher rates than before. Loans are a side issue that needs to be addressed, but means nothing in the overall scheme of things regarding automation. 

In the end, no robots probably won't take your job, most of the job shift happens as people retire and new come in, who will see different job opportunities, but about the same jobs long term as it is now. It has happened throughout history, and has happened in the height of the technological revolution, I see no reason it would happen now. ",1,0,1442626489,1444727331
cv5lov7,1,t3_3ld2pw,,"If interest rates are low, then people are less inclined to save money in the bank. This causes people to consume and invest more, which stimulates the economy. The downside of lower interest rates is that they really hurt people trying to save up for retirement. Plus, a certain degree of saving is vital for long term economic growth. In short, a higher interest rate is good for steady long term growth while a lower interest rate provides immediate stimulus for the economy.",1,0,1442556006,1444727331
