3kfcog,Structural question: What would happen if Congress and the Executive died simultaneously?,17,roboticphish,"I remember learning in middle school that there was a line of succession should the President, Vice President, Speaker, etc. were to die in the line of duty. But I don't recall what would happen in the event the entire Cabinet, Executive, and Congressional body were to die simultaneously. Say, perhaps, if a terrorist attack occurred during the State of the Union address. Where would power go in such an event? Would a congressional convention have to be called from all 50 states? Would power fall to the DC mayoral office? What would happen?",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kfcog/structural_question_what_would_happen_if_congress/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441905335,1444730436
