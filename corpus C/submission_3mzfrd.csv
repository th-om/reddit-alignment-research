Personally, I can't remember a primary election that has been so tepid and solemn.  


The [Democratic Primary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016) begin in only 4 months.   Is this truly healthy for a Democracy?


If this sort of thing was currently happening in the Republican Primary, I would be very angry right now (I'm a Republican).


Democrats, how do you personally feel about this?  When all is said and done, you will probably/realistically only have one real choice (Hillary).  Also, what if she is ""too big to fail"" as some in the media are saying?
