But you've assumed something that doesn't exist: a compensation regime for the losers.  The very idea is laughable in the modern U.S. political climate.

So we'll just pass a law taking money from the Chinese factory owner and giving it to the Illinois factory workers to compensate them....""

Laughable.  Rather, what happens is that the Illinois factory workers are just out of work, and the Chinese factory owner gets to buy a penthouse apartment in Beijing.

It is what economic theory says. It is what studies evaluating the evidence say. 

The compensation regime would be cool, and something like that would make free trade pareto efficient. However, free trade is Kaldor-Hicks efficient even without it. I would love a compensation or retraining regime. It would make the policy of free trade even better. Free trade is still a good policy even without it. 

And I don't think a compensation regime is laughable in the current US climate. It was something that was proposed as an add on to fast track authority. It is something that similar US deals have had in the past. 

In your scenario, a few thousand factory workers lose their jobs in the US. Over 300 million Americans get access to slightly cheaper goods. The cheaper goods also have second order effects. They give people more spending power so the economy is stimulated. This leads to some of the few thousand workers (and some other unemployed workers) being rehired and incomes for the tens of millions of Americans in the labor force going up slightly. 

This is not only how it works in theory, but studies have shown it is how it works in practice. ",1,0,1444085927,1444718232
cvpi348,0,t1_cvpgnig,jellicle,"> It is what economic theory says. It is what studies evaluating the evidence say. 

It simply isn't.  Sorry that you don't understand that.  The theory says that the world gains.  Theory does not say any set of individuals gains.  The gains may be distributed VERY unevenly.  One person may gain $7 billion and every other human on Earth might lose; nothing in economic theory says otherwise.

This is a very common right-wing economic distortion, pretending that gains from trade are distributed evenly so really, you (meaning the factory worker watching the Fox News segment) won't lose out.  It's false.

Kaldor-Hicks efficiency specifically does NOT require that compensation be made to the losers, and there may be very many - even billions - of losers.

And no, the idea that the wealth from the winners will trickle-down to the losers somehow, automagically, is empirically false.  Sucking a million dollars out of the economy of Illinois and putting into the economy of Beijing does not magically boost the economy of Illinois by so much that the million dollars is *more than replaced*.  This is exactly Ronald Reagan trickle-down theory, and it's nonsense.  Even if Illinoisans can buy cars $10 cheaper than otherwise, that's a second-order effect, and you're asserting that it becomes more powerful than the original effect!

What actually happens is that employment and wages in advanced nations are depressed, and this hurts every single worker in those economies (even ones that didn't lose their jobs).  Being able to buy cheap crap at Walmart doesn't come close to fully compensating for that.  Each and every worker in the United States would be better off with expensive imported crap and a high-paying job than cheap crap and no/low-paying job.

You and the other poster both continue to assert that there can be no losers from trade, because the magic trade fairy will come down and spread wealth over them.  Does this work for everything?  If I steal all your money, is this actually beneficial to you because I'll spend my stolen gains in the wider economy which will be so revved up that your personal income will increase so much that you'll make more money than I stole from you in the first place?

cvpj46q,0,t1_cvpi348,CompactedConscience,"Look, at the end of the day economics is an empirical field. We collect data on tariff rates, incomes, and employment. We use clever statistical tools to compare countries with freer trade to countries with less free trade in a way that allows us to isolate the effect of free trade. The case from these studies is overwhelming. Free trade benefits most people. If you add up all the benefits, they are substantial. Small reductions in tariffs can lead to big increases in aggregate welfare. None of the arguments you have made can counter this. None of the sources you use are good evidence against this. They don't do the work to establish causation, among other serious flaws. They would be laughed out of peer review. They hardly describe their research methodology at all. This is the most important point I can make, but I will also do a line by line critique because I don't want to do homework right now. 

>it simply isn't. 

The funny thing is, I have completed two years of econ grad school, I have linked posts about the opinion of experts, and I have had people with far more econ experience than myself comment agreeing with me, yet somehow I'm the one who doesn't understand economic theory. The gains in free trade are theoretically and empirically distributed exactly how I said they were. Gains are not distributed evenly, and I never said they were. They are, however, distributed broadly. They help more people than they hurt, by a wide margin. Though the people they hurt are hurt more than the people the people they help are helped. This is the second time you have deliberately misrepresented the position of someone in this thread. 

>Kaldor-Hicks

Yeah, I know what Kaldor-Hicks requires. This does not address my point. 

>Trickle down 

This isn't a trickle down argument. The vast majority of people will see an immediate gain in purchasing power. This almost definitionally stimulates the economy and will lead to higher level output, which typically leads to increased employment and income. But even if that did not occur, the positives would still outweigh the negatives. The simple gains in purchasing power outweigh the jobs lost without any general equilibrium effects happening at all. If you don't think that things can have second or third order effects, you should still think free trade is good. If you do believe they can have those effects, then you think it is even better. 

>sucking money out of IL

That isn't what is happening. Production is moved to places that have a comparative advantage in that kind of production. The US still makes something like 25% of the dollar valued manufactured goods in the world. Most of this is stuff like airplane parts or capital equipment or electronics that can't be made in many other places. Taking car factories out of IL to places where workers can produce them more efficiently leads to cheaper cars. It also, after a transition, lets them focus on their specialty, lets say, airplanes. 

>wages are depressed walmart nonsequiter etc.

If you look at median US total employee compensation instead of just wages (this includes bonuses, benefits packages, etc.) there is a noticeable upward trend. Plus see my introductory comments about causation. 

>Can be no losers from trade

We never once said that. Many times we said the exact opposite. Certainly over 90% of people will gain from trade, but not once did we say that 100% of people would. I wouldn't be shocked if closer to 99% of people gain from trade.

in Vietnam, ""Vietnam has significant problems with forced labor
and child labor. The U.S. Department of Labor finds that child labor is prevalent in the production of brick and garments, an industry that also is rife with forced labor. Vietnam is the second-largest source of apparel and textile imports to the United States, estimated to total $7.9 billion in value; the industry employs more than 2 million workers. Many of the clothes contain textiles produced in small workshops subcontracted to larger factories. These workshops frequently use child labor, including forced labor
involving the trafficking of children from rural areas into cities.""

in Brunei, ""Many of the 85,000 migrant workers in Brunei also
face labor exploitation and trafficking, related to
debt bondage from labor recruitment fees, wage
theft, passport confiscation, abuse and confinement.

cvowy9d,0,t1_cvovoow,heycoworker,"the TPP is a new kind of trade deal so it has attracted a lot of attention. Prior to this trade deals fell largely into two categories: bilateral or limited regional trade deals such as NAFTA and broad international trade deals such as the WTO. The WTO is currently in its fourth round of talks called the Doha Round however the Doha Round was initiated in 2001 and has pretty much entirely stalled. There are two reasons for this, 1. its really hard to get 123 nations to agree on anything at all and 2. the easiest issues have already been settled by the first three rounds of negotiation leaving only the most contentious issues left undecided. 

This is where the TPP comes in. The TPP is a regional agreement between twelve nations with the goal of creating regional free trade standards that other nations can join into if they decide they want in (a lot of pacific rim nations have expressed interest, including China). The basics are the same as any free trade agreement, the signatories will agree to lower tariffs on most but not all industries over a set period of time. This will encourage open trade and result in the specialization of national industries in the production of goods in which that nation has a comparative advantage. This particular agreement goes further and includes specific agreements on intellectual property rights and labor rights. These two issues have been contentious; some nations such as the US, ~~South Korea~~(as /u/dekuscrub pointed out, South Korea is not a signatory of this agreement), Singapore, and Japan wanted extensive property protections and high labor standards because their intellectual property is one of their major free trade assets and high labor standards would increase the value of their own labor markets which operate according to higher standards as compared to other pacific nations. The intellectual property issue was the hang-up and was just now decided. 

There is a lot of controversy in the public sphere over free trade agreements however it should be kept in mind that there is a very strong academic consensus in both the fields of political science and economics (fields that rarely agree on anything at all) that suggests free trade is always a net positives. The controversy is due in large part to the undeniable fact that some groups in the domestic economy loose out and the losses of free trade are more concentrated than the gains. So while 1,000 workers in noncompetitive domestic industry x might loose their jobs, the price of imported good y has gone down 15% for everybody and 500 highly skilled workers have been hired in competitive industry w. Because the losses are concentrated you hear more about it, however it has been empirically demonstrated many times over that free trade boosts productivity and prosperity and that the net gains are generally larger than the losses.

Is it not fair to say that these advantages were in large part due to slave wages and lack of environmental/human rights protections in the countries in question?  I nearly think that this is in fact the case.  Now, the modern deal supposedly includes a lot of language barring such activity, per reports (which is nice), but won't that make those countries have less of a competitive advantage and negate some of the potential cost savings?  It's like moving forward a foot and going backward 10 inches simultaneously.

Relevant excerpt from said article:

>In the early 80s, the influential and multi-partisan American Economics Association had 18,000 members. Only 12 called themselves supply-side economists. In American universities, there is no major department that could be called ""supply-side,"" and there is no supply-side economist at any major department. This is significant, because academia in the 70s was dominated by conservative economic theory, and conservative economists normally welcome any ideas that make the case against government intervention. The fact that they scrutinized supply-side theory and rejected it wholesale gives eloquent testimony to the theory's bankruptcy. When candidate George Bush called it ""voodoo economics"" in the 1980 presidential campaign, he was doing so with the full backing of America's economic community. ",5,0,1444056470,1444718460

Technically, in the US which is a republic we elect lawmakers who essentially work for the people. If enough people wanted lawmakers to pass plain labeling for soda (like many people have been pushing for GMO's) we may see that. But let's take the GMO thing for a second. Regardless of if you think they're good or bad, let's assume 80% of the populace wants foods made with GMO's clearly labeled (either because they think GMO's are bad or are wary of the pesticides used in GMO's - not getting into that debate here). But it's the *will of the people of a sovereign state* to have that done.

>Expanded trade, particularly with trading partners that are poorer and more labor-abundant than the United States, is **likely to lower the wages of most American workers.** While expanded trade is generally “win-win” at the country level, expanded trade redistributes so much income within countries that it’s **possible to make the majority of residents worse off—and this is indeed the likeliest scenario for the United States.**

and..

>Some TPP supporters claim the agreement will be “all gain, no pain” for American workers because U.S. tariffs are already low while trading partners’ tariffs are higher. These arguments are economically incoherent. In fact, studies that show the TPP will increase overall American national income also show that it will cause substantial reshuffling of domestic production away from labor-intensive import-competing sectors. **This will clearly inflict damage on large groups (probably the majority) of American workers.**

and then there's this beauty which directly contradicts your statement of ""It benefits poor American""

>The wage losses to workers on the wrong end of expanded trade are almost surely larger (in percentage terms) than the estimated net national gains from the TPP. Specifically, if the TPP would indeed boost national income by 0.4 percent while boosting imports and exports by 0.6 percent of GDP by 2025, as a widely cited estimate claims, **this would imply a loss to wages of non-college-educated workers of between 0.4 and 0.6 percent.**


Did you even read the article or report? 

Edit: Couple all of that with this..

>high unemployment because policymakers failed to boost demand growth

How is the TPP going to boost demand for growth? If we're potentially lowering wages and killing jobs you're hurting growth even more. Sure, maybe cheaper exports so we have higher foreign demand for our goods, but at the cost of decreased wages.

Then there's this bit under **The TPP, globalization, and wage growth: No such thing as an “all gain, no pain” treaty**:

>It is now widely acknowledged that globalization has played a role in the weak wage growth for most American workers and the rise in inequality that has characterized the past generation.3 In debates over trade agreements in the 1990s, this wage-suppressing impact of globalization was hotly disputed. But a reassessment of evidence as well as a sharp increase in imports from much-poorer nations has led most observers to agree that globalization has likely contributed to rising inequality.

>Despite this, however, many economists and policymakers continue to support trade agreements like the TPP. Often they argue that yes, global integration likely put downward pressure on the wages of a large swath of Americans over the past generation, but now the U.S. market is already so open to imports that further damage will be minimal.4 The corollary runs that because foreign markets remain less open to U.S. goods, trade agreements will just offer new opportunities for U.S. exporters. **Implicit in this view is that we can enjoy the overall national income–augmenting benefits of expanded trade opportunities offered by the TPP without suffering any of the regressive redistribution that has accompanied growing globalization in the past.** We can call this the “all gain, no pain” theory of the TPP.

>**However, these are facile arguments that don’t hold up to serious scrutiny.**

Given the *stellar* effect other past trade agreements have had I'm not holding any hope for the TPP.

Plus, you know, the fact that (from what we know) only 5 of the 29 chapters are actually about ""trade"". There's a whole host of negatives that (allegedly) come along with the TPP that I outlined here - https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nkhcy/tpp_deal_is_reached/cvpc4fz
