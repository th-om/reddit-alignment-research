3jvhiq,Why exactly is Trump considered to be a ridiculous candidate by so many people?,18,het_het,"I think he is a ridiculous candidate, but I'm not sure exactly why.  Here are the reasons I can think of so far:

1. He was a major player in the Obama citizenship conspiracy.
1. He said that Mexican immigrants were rapists.
1. He said that McCain was not a real war hero.
1. He made insensitive gender-related remarks about the debate moderator.


Reason one is obviously ridiculous, but reasons 2-4 were in my opinion given uncharitable interpretations by the media.  What other reasons are there for the widespread view that Trump is a buffoon?

Edit.
Here are some other reasons I've just thought of and also taken from the comments.

5.He has no political experience at all.

6.He was a reality TV star that might be more interested in attention than anything else. ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3jvhiq/why_exactly_is_trump_considered_to_be_a/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441559638,1444732148
