At the time, militias were formed by individuals using privately-owned weapons kept in their homes. Further, the supreme court has already decided that ownership of firearms is an individual right. The purpose of this right was to prevent tyranny.

That said, we have a huge list of legal precedents stating that the federal and state governments have the authority to regulate gun ownership. 

What we need is a background check, training, mental screening, and licensing system that allows competent individuals who don't pose a hazard to themselves or others to own firearms. 

Ideally it should be tiered, with:

a low-cost annual license (maybe $25) for those 18 and above in good mental health who have attended basic gun safety classes to own sporting weapons (perhaps including rimfire handguns), 

a moderately-priced license ($100) for those 21 and over who have been mentally screened and have received practical training to own center-fire handguns and military-style shotguns for self-defense (including concealed carry), 

and a costly license ($1000+ a year) for those 25 and over (car rental age) who have gone through intense screening and advanced training to own military-style semiautomatic rifles, precision rifles, etc.\.

Magazine capacity would be limited to 20. That's MORE than enough for ANY real-life purpose an American gun owner would ever face. Any magazine over 10 rounds would be taxed 50%. 

Military-style weapons (full-sized combat pistols, high-capacity semi-auto shotguns, precision rifles, AR-15s and AK47s) would also be taxed heavily. .50 cal anti-material rifles would be banned. They're cool and all, but seriously, what the fuck do you need a .50 cal for? The potential for harm greatly outweighs the possible benefits.

Advanced optics (sniper scopes, holosights, aimpoints) would be taxed just a little bit. Basically anything that makes a weapon deadlier and easier to use would be taxed. 

The taxes collected would be used to pay for mental healthcare and to buy back and destroy old, low-quality guns (especially Saturday Night Specials) that aren't of historical value (your vintage K91 or M1 Garand would be safe). 

If the crappiest 1/3rd of guns in America could be bought for $50 each, we could get rid of almost 100,000,000 guns for a mere $5,000,000,000....  which is almost certainly less than the lifetime earnings of all the people who were killed in shootings this year alone. For $100 would could probably get and even larger portion back. I would think having one gun for every 6 or 7 people would be a reasonable goal (currently it's almost 1 for 1).

Getting rid of a huge percentage of cheap guns creates scarcity, which increases the value of high-quality guns that remain. Gun manufacturers make more money selling guns that are worth more, as well as on replacement parts for those in existence.

Gun nuts would also hold on to their collections more tightly, meaning guns would change hands less often, further increasing the  market value of new, high-quality guns.

Because access is down, gun crime goes down, without anyone's rights being infringed in any real sense except for a tax burden. I do not propose a tracking/registration system because that would defeat the purpose of having guns to prevent tyranny (it only makes them easier to confiscate). This is purely a licensing and taxation-based system.

A few more optional rules: 

Gun safes and or locks could be required once low-cost, reliable biometric options are available. Perhaps all by one or two guns should be locked in a safe to mitigate gun thefts.

Ammunition could be taxed, with reloading being tax exempt because it's better for the environment. This would make it harder to stockpile shit-tons of ammo. Hollow-point and lead rounds would be taxed more than environmentally-safe rounds.",-5,0,1444105217,1444716324

People who aren't proficient with firearms CAN'T defend themselves. They are a bigger threat to themselves and others than they are a deterrent for crime. Statistics prove this.

>it helps to at least minimally understand what you are trying to regulate.

I have been shooting since early childhood and I consider myself more knowledgeable about firearms than the majority of the population.

>For starters, there is no difference between a sporting weapon... and a ""precision rifle"" (and many competitions actually REQUIRE military weapons, because, surprise, surprise, they were at least initially ran by the army).

Let me clarify... By sporting weapon I mean ones specifically designed for hunting and target purposes. By precision rifle I mean rifles designed to shoot people at long distances. The competitions you're referring to used low-capacity bolt action and semi-auto battle rifles. These would be protected as relics and curios.

>And, of course, it is completely pointless as almost no homicides are perpetrated using rifles.

In this case difference ""statistically insignificant"" means ""dozens of people every year.""

> It's all handguns, and under 5 rounds fired per crime. The ""black rifles"" everyone is losing their shit over are used only in mass shootings, which are super rare. And even for mass shooting, if you limit access to rifles there, criminals would simply switch to handguns. 

Mass shootings are not rare. One happens nearly every week in the US. Low-capacity handguns are less deadly than high-capacity military-style rifles.

>In Columbine the rifles were AWB compliant.
Secondly, magazines used in Columbine were 10rd. 

Columbine happened back when mass shootings were rare, and happened when neither schools nor the police had response measures in place for active shooter scenarios. If it had happened today with the AWB restrictions still in place, it's possible there would have been fewer causalities. 

>Limiting magazines to any number above 3 makes absolutely no difference - you can always simply carry more magazines.

That is a fallacious argument that I used to use myself. It simply isn't true. There is an absolute limit to how many magazines you can carry yet still have easy access to, and having lower capacity magazines means fewer rounds can be fired per minute. I suggest 20 because it doesn't limit the capacity of any handguns on the market, and doesn't significantly impact the capacity of a military-style rifle, which I still feel has some legitimate national defense purpose. Especially if you're talking about a 7.62. It's only a matter of time before someone uses a bunch of casket mags and kills 100+ people.

>May I ask, what is the point of banning ""anti-material"" rifles (btw, it's spelled anti-materiel, as they have nothing to do with anti-matter)? (Good job on your Battlefield skills, dude!) Have you ever seen one? Have you heard of anyone being killed by one? 

The point is because they're incredibly devastating weapons that could be used for terrorism and assassinations at a great distance with relatively little skill and have little or no value for anyone but the military. To answer your other questions, yes, and yes. The only reason they haven't been used for more crimes is because they're still incredibly expensive. Yes, materiel. I knew that. My mistake.

>Also, killed by rifles with ""advanced optics"", whatever it is, and whatever distinguishes it from a less advanced optics?

Advanced optics in this case means optics designed for combat. High-power sniper scopes, ACOG scopes, military-grade red dot sights, laser sights, etc. They make it easier to kill people. Note that I am not suggesting that they should be regulated, simply that they should be taxed.

>Now, the gun buyback... Where to begin? $50 would be what it would cost to collect, safeguard, sort, and destroy the guns according to BATFE specs.

Fine, I concede that $50 is an overly low estimate.

> The ""crappiest"" 1/3rs of the gun would probably be closer to $200 per, on average. Of course your collection will be somewhat biased towards broken guns, which are pointless to collect in the first place.

Not true. Many guns that aren't in ""fireable"" condition can still be used to kill someone...once. Although they might take the shooter's fingers with it. Something that has effectively been deactivated wouldn't be bought back, because what's the point?


>And of course all of your guns will come from, well, how to say it - non criminals? 

All guns used come from someone who bought it legally at some point. The whole idea is that the ratio of guns to people has become unmanageable, at that access to guns is too easy.

>The people who wouldn't do much harm with them anyway? 

Except for all the suicides and accidents, which shouldn't be ignored.

>Of course, we could also spend these few billion dollars for launching a space mission, but screw that! We're going to blow it on a feel-good measure that would do nothing to violence.

The taxes collected on gun/magazine/ammo sales and licenses could pay for even, even if we ignore the reduced healthcare costs, lost wages, and human costs. Second, gun buyback programs on the national level were proven effective in Australia. At that scale, it's more than simply a feel-good thing.

>Of yes, I given that very large percentage of shooters and shootees are gangsters, the ""almost certainly less than lifetime earnings"" - I wouldn't go as far as that. Gangsters have short lives, and they don't make too much money.

....And they would live longer lives and hopefully have a chance to eventually reform themselves if there was less easy access to guns. There is a strong correlation between gun crime/deaths and access to guns. That's the whole point of my proposal; to reduce access without banning guns.


>The high quality guns that remain, with or without Saturday Night special, already have decent value. After all, they mostly retail for $500-$5000, depending on your definition....

Nope. You can buy a decent used shotgun for as little as $50, and a quality used handgun for less than $200. 

>....so I would venture a guess that you don't need additional incitement for people to have their guns stolen.
Speaking for access. There are 11000 murders in the US every year. You only need at most 11000 gun for that. With 200M guns left over after your collection, the remaining guns will last the criminals for many thousand years.

All of my proposals would likely reduce the availability of illegal guns by 50% of more...  and the available of guns in general to ineligible buyers by probably even more than that. Assuming this was true, it would be fallacious at best to suggest this wouldn't effect the number of gun crime and gun deaths.

>I am not going to go into opining about your reloading as being more ""environmentally friendly"" proposal. I think skills learned playing Battlefield fail you here :-).

Both are, for all practical purposes, banned. RPGs rounds can't be imported by civilians, and aren't made by anyone domestically. It's NOT simply a matter of paying a $200 tax. A legal M60 costs $50,000. Both of these things are true because of legislation that was introduced at some point. Clearly, it has worked.
