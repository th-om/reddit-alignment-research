cvjrmb2,0,t1_cvjmb6r,sje46,"I wouldn't say ""by miles"".  She still has a healthy lead but she's been declining while Sanders has been increasing.  If you take a very naive view of things and extrapolate the lines, then the two lines will definitely intersect before the primaries.  Four months ago Hil was leading 63.6 to Sanders'  8.8.  That's a 54.8 difference.  Now, they are at 40.8 and 27.6, which is only 13.2 difference.  Going by those trends naively means that Sanders will win handily.

Of course, it won't actually be that easy.  There are tons of factors. The biggest one is that Sanders has a perceived ceiling due to the fact he really only appeals to a single demographic--white liberals.  Minorities he does terrible with.  But there are many factors that benefit him as well--Hillary's ongoing email scandal is making her more and more untrustworthy-looking to voters.  Also, what if Biden comes in?  Also Sanders is expected to shine in debates relative to deliberately moderate Clinton.  Expect his polls to jump after them.

Hillary is still favored to win at this point, but I definitely would *not* say Sanders has no chance.  Especially, especially after NH, where he has a very healthy lead, and winning that state gives you a *huge* bump, although not a guaranteed nomination.  There's also the possibility that the pundits and experts may be wrong in their assessment about minority voters--if Sanders spins it well, he could manage to eek out the black vote from Clinton.",0,0,1443647738,1444721502

Sanders has benefited from nobody running against him. He's 100% positive. No negative. Nobody has called him on anything. He can say all the great things he wants and nobody has said anything. Because nobody is paying attention. Once the race actually starts is a different story.

Some of the most interesting and original candidates in years on that side are being drowned out by either the chorus of candidates or the Trump Show. 

Also, we had a very protracted fight in 2008. We did manage to come together after, but it was divisive. A lot of people (including myself) thought we were incredibly lucky to have two heavy hitting, quality candidates running. Many thought it a shame that to get Obama we had to pass on Hillary, so now that she's running this time it's like getting to have both after all. 

As for Bernie, I don't buy for a minute he's being shortchanged. He gets a ton of media exposure. To the extent that people don't know him it's because they don't care about primary politics or aren't very politically engaged. If you pay attention to politics and don't know about Bernie Sanders, that's on you at this point. His biggest problem is that even people who like his policies (like myself) don't want to vote for him as president. I think he's a great Senator but I just don't see him as president. It's like Ron Paul; the Paulites couldn't believe how little support he got and figured it must be the media. But the truth is that outside of reddit and college campuses there aren't many libertarians and there aren't many socialists in the US.

Well, I think HRC won the 2016 nomination in 2008. We had two choices we were pretty smitten with, but you only get one at a time. Obama was a sexier but riskier choice, so I think it was better to run him in a cycle where victory was a slam dunk for the blue team. That's no slight on Mr. Obama who, in my view, is the class of his generation as an electoral politician. I just can't see a man of Kenyan, socialist, Muslim, atheist lineage with bare little experience getting the nod over a conventional Republican in an even election year. Obama won an election the Democrats were supposed to win. That kept Clinton holstered until '16, when a more conventional candidate with a massive machine would be needed to win what will likely be a fairly even election. She's more centrist that Obama, even if only by image, and can broaden the Obama coalition some with whites and women. If the redbros nominate Bush, I think the contrast against Clinton does wonders for the Democrats as well. People are still down on the Bush name, while the Clinton economy is remembered very fondly. If a lot of casual voters operate on the heuristic of ""do I want more Clinton years or Bush years,"" as I expect will happen, that's an easy advantage to Clinton. 

TL;DR. Oama vs. Clinton was a tie. So, we ran the riskier candidate when victory was more assured, and we'll run the more sure bet when victory is less assured. ",7,0,1443631047,1444721519
