True. And many people refuse to acknowledge the role that past racism, poverty, and most importantly law enforcement have had in the inner city. Their culture reflects their environment, which they haven't had much control over. 

Do a thought experiment. Let's say that you have a city. You imprison 10% of the men under 35 in that city. How are the remaining men going to behave? In regards to the remaining women, however the fuck they want to behave. Why? Because there is a huge male scarcity problem. To generalize, they can have a woman without doing any of the shit that white women in America today make their man do. Shit like keep a job, pay the bills, don't commit crimes, don't cheat. The number one reason a white woman leaves her man? Money. The number one reason an African-American woman leaves her man? Cheating. I'm not making that up. Those are true statistics. They can be irresponsible, reprehensible human beings and still get pussy. 

Kidding aside, there is a point behind that. Incarcerating 10% of men that are of the age that they house, feed, clothe, and educate the future generation *will destroy any group and change any culture.* Before the war on drugs, black people had the same, if not slightly better, marriage rate than white people.

[Here](http://prisontime.org/2013/08/12/timeline-black-support-for-the-war-on-drugs/) is a bit of a timeline on the evolution of drug laws:

>1971.  February.  The Congressional Black Caucus founded on a motion by Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY). According to historian Marguerite Ross Barnett, the group quickly made “a transformation from a small, relatively powerless, and ignored group of representatives to a national cynosure.”  Through most of its history, the CBC would advocate actively for tough drug war legislation. 

>1973.  January.  New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, a longtime member of the NAACP with close ties to the black community, rolls out drug laws that would set a new standard for tough sentences, even for low-level non-violent drug offenders. “I have one goal and one objective and that is to stop the pushing of drugs and to protect the innocent victim,” Rockefeller declared, at a press conference. 

So what I am trying to say is whereas the war on drugs is mostly seen as a failure, the deterioration of those communities often preceded the harsh sentences, and are in fact the reason those harsh sentences exist (more accurately, it is ONE of the reason those harsh sentences exist).",4,0,1442605724,1444727046

That they pushed for it isn't relevant to my point at all. I'm talking about cause and effect.

>So what I am trying to say is whereas the war on drugs is mostly seen as a failure, the deterioration of those communities often preceded the harsh sentences, and are in fact the reason those harsh sentences exist (more accurately, it is ONE of the reason those harsh sentences exist).

While that might be true for drug sentencing (or not I don't know), its not true that sentences weren't already getting more harsh.

[From here:](http://www.nber.org/papers/w20283.pdf)

>More than two decades ago, Smith and Welch (1989) used the 1940 through 1980 census files to document important relative black progress. However, recent data indicate that this progress did not continue, at least among men. The growth of incarceration rates among black men in recent decades combined with the sharp drop in black employment rates during the Great Recession have left most black men in a position relative to white men that is really no better than the position they occupied only a few years after the Civil Rights Act of 1965. A move toward more punitive treatment of arrested offenders drove prison growth in recent decades, and this trend is evident among arrested offenders in every major crime category. Changes in the severity of corrections policies have had a much larger impact on black communities than white communities because arrest rates have historically been much greater for blacks than whites.

[And here:](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/18/chart-of-the-week-the-black-white-gap-in-incarceration-rates/)

>But in the U. Chicago study, Neal and Rick concluded that progress on similar measures have sputtered since 1980, in part because of the disproportionately high incarceration rates. They noted, for example, that while employment rates for all men had declined since 1980, “these declines in employment and increases in incarceration have been much more dramatic among black men than white men.” The authors attributed part of this trend to the change in prison policies in the 1970s and 80s.

The harsher sentencing predated crack by a decade. 

To believe that this is culture, you need to come up with a narrative for a cultural change in the black community that started around 1970. Then you need to explain how white incarceration also increased. Was that a change in white culture? Why did both cultures change? If the both changed, is it appropriate to even differentiate based on culture? Or is it more likely that we had changes in prison policies that affected both cohorts?

I mean, I grew up in a state (Arizona) that didn't really have a lot of black people around. I have since lived in Virginia, Michigan, and now Illinois and I have to say a lot what I have seen is shocking. I never really saw people that seemed to embrace the image of being thugged out before I moved from Arizona.

It was weird to me being at a public pool where there was about 50% black people there, and it was all families at this pool. And seeing the black people set up speakers and blasting pretty graphic rap music while 3 and 4 year old girls were twerking to it. It was so inappropriate we had to ask management to change the music. These weren't poor blacks either, but seemingly well to do ones. I think that sort of stuff normalizes behavior and attitudes that are detrimental honestly.

It was weird when I saw several black people punch a white girl in the face and steal her purse, while all the other surrounding black people started cheering. That was crazy to me. 

It was weird when I first moved to the town I live in now, and every time we had black people over something was stolen. 100% of the time we had some people over and there were black people that a friend brought over, something went missing from our house. 100% of the time. Not exaggerating.

I thought it was weird when my friend got jumped by a group of black teenagers. When my friend went to court, it turned out that all of them were from middle class families and they admitted they were just looking for white people to rob out of boredom.

I think it is so strange to see so many black people walking around with their pants around their asses, grills in their mouths smoking blunts on the corner. Do they think someone is gonna hire them when every other word out of their mouth is the n word or some other cuss word?

None of that behavior is forced on them. That is all behavior they have adopted because they think its cool. Therefore, I do believe their culture is by far the largest inhibitor of their own success. I simply don't see poor Asians doing the same thing at all.

Unfortunately, this means that it is also often closely tied to race, socioeconomic status, and levels of education (among other things).

I've been considering how one might change this, and I don't deny that it's been a problematic thought experiment. The most obvious approach is Machiavelli's, in which you ban anything that allows culture to to be passed on (language, calendar), which, naturally, is not a fantastic approach.

The best I've been able to think of so far is to provide sufficient incentives for communities to disperse and mix, at racial and socioeconomic levels. My hope would be that this would disassociate these attributes from cultural identity in later generations, thus greatly lessening the problem.",4,0,1442618217,1444727050

For example, Cedar Rapids Iowa is an oasis of technology in a desert of corn. It is large enough to have 4 high schools yet small enough that almost everyone of all socioeconomic levels attends the same schools. It is large enough to have immigrant and other minority groups yet small enough that a person can walk from one ethnic enclave to another in 20 minutes. There are migrant farm workers and Somali refugees and for some reason a large Czech diaspora contingent.

People fear ""others"" much less when everybody is accustomed to each other. It doesn't mean everyone has to be the same or join a melting pot. It means everyone has to bump elbows often enough that they aren't cultural aliens to each other.

I hosted a number of Russian colleagues in Cedar Rapids. We used to go on long walks talking about politics and education. As a stereotype, Russians love to argue. I lived in the most affluent part of town. We'd walk past homes that the Russians called palaces or Dacha. A mile later, we were in a working class neighborhood. The Russians couldn't believe or more to the point thought it was insane that ""rich"" people would send their children to the same schools as the working class kids.  I expected Russians to have a strong egalitarian impulse, but they were quite elitist in my opinion. [To be fair, I was hosting well educated Russian engineers in the early 90s when only the most politically connected and elite Russians were traveling to the USA.]

There was no issue of unequal school funding in Cedar Rapids. They had open enrollment. Any child could attend any school. It was all one school district within the city, and the two suburbs were so tiny as to not matter.


Edit: Additions

My Russian guests laughed and taunted the sidewalk Socialists in Iowa City who tried to hand out Pravda issues. The Russians said, ""Not even Russians read that.""

If you want to convince a Russian that Capitalism works in ways Socialism doesn't, take them to Cedar Rapids. 

- The farmers are prosperous (by any standard but particularly compared to communal farms in Russia). 

- The poorest residents live in well maintained homes or apartment complexes. 

- Unemployment is low

- Crime is almost non-existent

- Stores are thriving with well stocked shelves and luxury goods.

- Food is high quality and inexpensive

- Schools are some of the best in the nation

- There are arts and cultural venues


All of the above was even more true in the 90s when Russians experienced bread lines even in Moscow, produce was left rotting in the Russian fields, and luxuries like school supplies and soap were nearly impossible to buy for most Russians. The Russians I knew would ridicule Reddit Socialists. ",4,0,1442626320,1444727050

>As far as supply side economics the economic theory is still very much fact based.

No, it's based on a series of assumptions. Assumptions in the absence of data are necessary to forge a hypothesis. Assumptions in the face of facts which contradict them is blind faith.

>Also like I said you may not like the results of supply side economics but you can't argue that the American economy as a whole has benefited using supply side economics. The only way to argue against it would be to use a faith based ideology and ignore the facts of America's growing economy.

No, the American economy has not benefited from supply side economics, as the preponderance of economic data shows this. Supply side economics lead to higher deficits, lower wages, larger consumer debt, and a growth in income inequality. It was a complete failure. The only reason it remains in currency is because it benefits the wealthy -- much like how the ""divine right of kings"", in spite of being absurd, remained relevant well into the early modern era because it benefited Europe's aristocracy. Yet for all that, it was no less laughable and faith-based.

That the US economy grew is not an endorsement of supply-side economics. The US economy also grew -- and grew faster -- in the era before supply-side economics. Secondly, economic growth as measured by GDP does not indicate anything about the wisdom of a particular economic theory, since GDP only indirectly relates to the benefits experienced by the average citizen. [Iran's GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran#/media/File:IRAN_GDP.jpg) has grown healthily over the last few decades, yet this is hardly an endorsement of having a government-controlled economy run by Islamic clerics, is it?",1,0,1442785334,1444727057

I've probably stayed the same as I got older, but that is because I started off fairly conservative and have since loosened my moral stances on things a bit.

It works both ways in that if you start off conservative, experience should give you more empathy and open your eyes to the possibility that everything can't be fixed with conservative ideas. If you start of liberal you should gain awareness that everything can't be fixed with liberal ideas.

I would think the reality is that you become more moderate as you get older, but that society is constantly being pulled left by well thinking but often delusional liberals/progressives and you get left behind and are now considered ""conservative"" for not being liberal enough.

My view on politics is that we NEED conservatives to maintain a balanced and working society based on what has worked in the past to keep us prosperous. But we also NEED liberals to constantly challenge us to do better.

The problem is when we try to do too much, too fast, without real research or disregarding the problem that arise from such massive changes in such short time periods.

Conservatives are good at keeping Progress at a slow and steady  march instead of running us down rabbit trails and off a cliff.

cv6wbhr,1,t3_3lgicv,RationalRattachist,"It doesn't have anything to do with intelligence or emotion, most people shift to the right as they get older because it's in their self interest to vote for them. 

Other examples are people like Peter Hitchens and Melanie Phillips, but they didn't grow a head, their hearts just changed. When reading both of their commentaries, it is undeniable they are based on emotion.",1,0,1442670580,1444727079
cv73qcu,1,t3_3lgicv,its_oliver,"ITT (and on most of reddit): people only talking about social issues to determine one's place on the political spectrum and creating stereotypes of the other side. People need to get through their heads that voters can be socially liberal and economically conservative or vice versa. I realize there is overlap here but we put forth this idea on reddit that all conservatives are religious nuts and or all liberals are naive and unaware of reality. When we fabricate this ingrained picture of the ""others"" it really stops any useful discussion. Maybe my head is in the clouds on this but I think we'd be much better off a nation if we could learn to debate and think critically. ",1,0,1442686038,1444727079
cv7sbq1,1,t3_3lgicv,molotoviphone,"People assume that the ideological orientation of people has to do with age alone. ""Young people are liberals, old people are conservatives."" I hear that often here. 

It's actually based on our daily experiences. Young people who have just started out are more likely to support bills that put them on equal grounds with older people that have been working for years, such as redistribution of wealth from the top class to the middle class. 

Older people have made their money, and there is no reason for them to change their lifestyle. It is in their best interests to be conservative. ",1,0,1442745759,1444727083
cv68fya,1,t3_3lgicv,Foxtrot56,"I was the opposite. I was really conservative, voted for Bush twice and then I realized that what I really cared about wasn't being addressed by Republicans. I realized that all their talk of helping people and helping the little guy was just smoke and mirrors for supporting big business. I am very liberal now, I agree with Bernie Sanders on most things but I think he is too conservative on a few issues. I really like most of what Jill Stein says.",1,0,1442606722,1444727083
