3l4zf1,"In response to ""How would a Sanders agenda get accomplished?"", how would a Clinton agenda get accomplished?",23,zusamenentegen,"Daily reminder that the Republican party has not quite been willing to negotiate on much, even with *significant* concessions from the other side. 

Yes, Sanders is farther left than Clinton. But Clinton is at least putting forward moderate/slight left policies, many of which cost money or are polarizing ideas. 

For the sake of this topic I'll put aside candidacy biases and take her for her word according to her campaign website. Some of her positions include. 

* Expanding social security  
* Expanding medicare  
* Paid family leave 
* investment in infrastructure  
* more gun control  
* defending planned parenthood  
* Obama's free community college plan which she has endorsed  
* paid sick days  

Not exactly resounding Republican policies. So yes, a Sanders presidency would face obstructionism. But I don't see how a Clinton presidency would be any different. Would she be more willing to compromise? My guess is yes, but where exactly? At the very least Sanders has passed a significant bipartisian and passed significant bipartisan amendments that amount to more than naming a post office. 

Putting aside domestic agendas there are other issues we can talk about. But of course the domestic issues are currently the focus.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l4zf1/in_response_to_how_would_a_sanders_agenda_get/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442382576,1444727985
