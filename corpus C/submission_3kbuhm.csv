3kbuhm,What would happen if we lowered the minimum wage?,88,spacemoses,"We are pretty familiar with the frequent discussions of the $15/hr minimum wage increase here on Reddit.  What would be the result of lowering the minimum wage to, say $4/hr?

Some potential thoughts (I do not necessarily believe these myself)

- Minimum wage workers would be more incentivized to get a professional job

- Companies like Walmart could offer unbelievably lower prices for their goods

- Small business owners might flourish
