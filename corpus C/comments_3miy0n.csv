I am not saying the news should stop covering the scandal, it is a legitimate concern, but it would be good if they focus on policy at least as much as they do the scandal.

The media won't go away from talking about a scandal even if it doesn't exist. Right now on the less Circus-like Democratic race, besides Hillary's ""scandal,"" there isn't much to discuss that is going to draw people in at this stage in the cycle. Her view, as well as Bernie's views, are available on their respective websites. Hillary's are very broad in some areas, and mainly maintain the status quo, but she certainly hasn't introduced anything new to the table that would be newsworthy on a daily basis. 

There is a far greater discussion of Sanders because, unlike Hillary, his policies are much more drastic and worth talking about whether you disagree with them or not. All of the GOP candidates SHOULD be in the spotlight as there has been minimal discussion of policy issues of actual importance.

Hillary gets away with it because her policies are honestly pretty much in line with Barack's....there isn't a whole lot to say about them. She's not attacking drugs, immigration, or wanting to put up a wall. ",2,0,1443356010,1444723251
cvfr8g3,1,t3_3miy0n,kingvitaman,"I thought it was pretty telling that Fiorna's first big ad after surging in the polls was a direct response to Trump calling her ugly. ""This face"". Ugh, I thought she would take the high road and try to chip away at Trump by discussing policy, but no. He's made the bed that all of the GOP have to lie in at this point. With Bush hovering around 8% ( a third of Trump) I think the GOP has to really start considering the fact that Trump isn't going anywhere anytime soon. I don't expect him to win, but I think he will drastically shape the approach the GOP has to take in order to take him out. Saying someone is stupid beats a tax plan any day of the week.

Its just a pattern over the last few cycles. Weird candidates look strong and then fade to more mainstream, traditional candidates. Trump has led for longer though, I'll give him that. That's probably a testament to his personality and quick thinking, IMO. He's winning it with contentless debates and interviews.

When Bernie releases policy it is a way of letting you know where he stands, what his opinions are, and what he would like to see in his ideal world.

When Hillary Clinton releases policy it is an actual indication of what changes she will make if elected president.

I am yet to see one policy proposal from Bernie Sanders that has even a remote chance of success. With Hillary I know that if she stakes her name to it, it means something. ",-1,0,1443396496,1444723251
