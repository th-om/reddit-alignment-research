The biggest problem with the modern corporate system is that penalties are largely relegated to fines, and that the fines (while large) are minor compared to the income of the larger organizations.  It essentially turns the consequences of breaking the law into a manageable business expense.

People within corporations commit crimes, but the blame is applied to the fictional entity instead of the flesh and blood people due to how liability is assigned.  There needs to be far more painful deterrents in place for businesses who knowingly and willfully violate the law as part of their business practices, and more of the penalty should be assessed towards upper management (jail-time, direct fine, etc), rather than applied to the fictional entity.",1,0,1443750475,1444720849

cvldw0o,1,t3_3n577d,r_a_g_s,"I can promise you that, at least in places like Canada and the US, Every Single Line of Every Single Regulation was drafted because someone identified A Problem with the way this or that business or person or organization was doing things, and drafted and implemented the regulation to Fix The Problem.

Now, of course, you often end up with side effects and unintended effects and so on.  But a surprisingly high percentage of the time, government regulations are there for good reasons.

As a Canadian who loves hockey and continues to referee it, you see the same thing happen with hockey rules. There are some rules in the rulebook that make you think ""Why in the **heck** did they make up this rule?!""  And then you hear about back in the day when some player or coach took an unfair advantage in a certain situation, and the rule was introduced to prevent it happening again.  Or when some conduct led to more or worse injuries, rules were brought in to reduce the possibility and severity of said injuries.

> Do you think there's a better system out there of holding firms accountable for their actions than our current one?

Well, if firms weren't so narrow-mindedly focussed on profit at the expense of all else, and if they acted holistically in their nations and communities and environment, and if they didn't spend so much time trying to find loopholes in regulations, or lobbying politicians to make more complicated regulations that would exempt their specific industry or company from certain regulations ... well, you get the idea.

No shit - but that's kind of the point.

If you do not have to worry about workplace safety then *of course* you're going to save money.  If you don't have to worry about building facilities that *don't* pollute the environment with industrial waste, then *of course* you're going to save money.  If you don't have to be accountable to people you swindle, then *of course* you're going to save money.

The question is whether doing these things, and enacting and following these regulations, is a net benefit for society and the individuals in it.
