3lgq9a,"My favorite line from the moderators of the CNN debate: ""You didnâ€™t answer my question.""",103,iliveintexas,"Not really a discussion, but I'd like to acknowledge that the moderators on a few occasions were willing to call out that a candidate didn't actually answer their question.

The lack of real answers greatly frustrated me with Fox News' first debate, where Baier, Kelly, and Wallace basically let the candidates say whatever they wanted most of the time. Not to suggest that I had higher expectations for Fox News.

Nonetheless, I appreciate the effort in this debate.",169,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lgq9a/my_favorite_line_from_the_moderators_of_the_cnn/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442601283,1444726928
