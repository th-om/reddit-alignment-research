cuw8d2p,1,t3_3kblie,FlareCorran,"One of the things I realized when I was studying Political Science is that most people have very little idea about how government works, even if they consider themselves informed. Unfortunately, that includes most journalists, so the average person (who doesn't enjoy watching CSPAN) will struggle to get accurate information about what is going on.

As a result, most people's views on government, left or right, is naive. From people who think term limits will increase bipartisanship to people who think that Congresspeople should just stay in their states and vote by video chat, a lot of proposals are clearly based on a horribly flawed view of the government. 

Honestly, it's why I've become less and less of a democrat as time goes on. I don't trust people to make good decisions about their leaders because I don't trust them to even know what the leader does. I certainly don't trust them to vote on issues directly. 

Unfortunately, there's no good way to solve this problem.",12,0,1441844766,1444730949

cuxennh,1,t3_3kblie,PKMKII,"I think a lot of this generally, but especially on Reddit, is the fundamental dismissal or ignorance of the complexity of law and the kind of intelligence needed to effectively master it. It's that common Reddit attitude of ""They aren't smart, they're just lawyers! Lawyers don't find *the truth,* they just know how to argue their position.""

In truth, laws are not this thing where you just say ""it should be this way"" and so it is. Most people find legalese dry and boring, but if you don't word things in just the right way, if you don't recognize what the wording means, then you can end up voting for, or even writing, a law that does the opposite of what you wanted. But most people process their politics like they do their sports, reduced to the most basic us vs. them mentalities and then their eyes glaze over when people start talking about the real mechanisms.",1,0,1441933231,1444730949

cuzs7ys,1,t3_3kblie,Mrs_Frisby,"I think most people here agree with you on some level even if they don't think they do.

You'll notice that there is a lot of anti-Clinton ferver here, but none of it is focused on her ability to get things done.  That is taken as a given.  Instead people try to convince you that her decades of public service have all been a trick - even Bill's terms as president - to set us all up so she can at last screw us over in 2016.  That she will use her competence and effectiveness to do some nebulous Bad Thing(tm) because she is secretly evil and laughing at us.  

Using this argument, the bar is lowered for Bernie to merely holding the line and wielding a veto pen well.  The second part of this argument, after all, is that since the GOP holds the house and Senate it is impossible for good to be done so we need not expect Bernie to accurately accomplish anything should he gain the Big Chair.  

It's a gorgeous double standard.  Bernie's lack of accomplishments thus far doesn't matter because doing anything good is impossible anyway.  And Clinton's far more impressive track record of successfully implementing lefty policy is transformed into a bad thing because she's totally going to use her competence to achieve wicked ends this time ( cause you know how evil people are who .. upon attaining wealth ... immediately give most of it to charity to build schools, provide medical care to the poor, and plant trees like the nefarious Clinton Foundation does).

The contrast between the upbeat attitudes of the Bernistas and the frankly defeatist arguments they wield is a heck of a thing.

cuwb84y,1,t3_3kblie,rwilso7,"So everyone here is pretty sold on the Insiders as the way to go? Their only selling point is there competence, only problem being they're not very competent. I say let the people decide on as much as possible. They will become serious with real power in their hands, and will change minds if they're wrong. Anyway, it's their country to screw up, not the ""Insiders.""",-1,0,1441849834,1444730949
