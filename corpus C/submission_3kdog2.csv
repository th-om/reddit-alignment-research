3kdog2,Kim Davis is multiplying. Three more clerks are now refusing to serve gay people. What's the endgame here? How will this issue be resolved and will it impact the 2016 election?,430,kingvitaman,"I find the issue interesting because in a twisted sort of way these people are all committing civil disobedience ( much like Huckabee said they would, no mistake he's leading the charge) which is often championed by the left as an effective way to bring about change. Except that, with the issue of these clerks who refuse to serve gay people, I'm not sure what their end game is. Do they think they will overturn the Supreme Court decision? Get special treatment because of their religious beliefs? And also, as this progresses, couldn't gay and lesbian couples begin suing the state for civil rights violations at some point?",168,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kdog2/kim_davis_is_multiplying_three_more_clerks_are/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441880663,1444730556
