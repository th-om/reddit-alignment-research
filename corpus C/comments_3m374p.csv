As we speak, Daraprim is being cranked out and sold for pennies by other manufacturers. Unfortunately, Shkreli has been handed an artificial monopoly. It is illegal for people living in America to shop around and import many needed medications from competitors overseas. 

If people could freely choose to fill their prescriptions from the manufacturers offering them the best value, the moron who jacked up the pills for $750 each would be committing economic suicide. Nobody in their right mind is going to pay $750 for a single pill when they could pick up months of medication for a few dollars.

>The problem is that if you completely liberalized drug approval, you could set off a race to the bottom between different national standards, especially with research. 

Its true that without controls on trade its difficult to regulate the quality and safety of medication, but competition is still a crucial part of how consumers influence prices, and exclusive ownership of intellectual property rights eliminates that control on the consumers part, and allows producers to set arbitrary prices, when in theory competitors could be producing this medication at close to a dollar a pill. 

Such occurrences are certainly not a necessary evil of having a free market economy. They're a necessary evil of having intellectual property rights protections. And if people can get the same medication on the black market from a counter fit drug company in India, then it is certainly possible to produce quality medication without allowing wealthy businessmen from assuming legal monopolies. 

The way I see it, using intellectual property rights in order to control the quality of medication is like drug prohibition. It looks good on paper but it doesn't work. And those regulating the trade of legal variants are no more qualified than the drug dealers you'd normally find on the street, except now they're protected by the government. And without competition, the consumer now has no choice but to submit to the corrupted party rather than having the freedom to find legitimate producers that naturally emerge due to selective pressures. 

Markets form and evolve on their own, without regulation. It only becomes a problem when one individual exercises their advantages over others, but the availability of real resources, not intellectual property, introduces its own selective pressures. If one party can produce the same product but at a lower cost, financial or social, they deserve to succeed. No single person should be able to sit on their ass and rake up income because they own an idea, their wealth should be a function of the work they put into it. 

And when it comes to black markets and freedom of information, we have to accept that information can't be controlled. If it costs nothing to produce the product, it should be free. And as a community we should resort to organizing socially and developing technology to influence trade rather than hiding behind laws and regulations. Because as it stands, every idea is owned by someone now. A new class system is in place, and our children will not have the right to manage successful businesses or produce innovative technologies unless they're born into it. 

Wage disparity is not a necessary evil either, its artificially built into the system. And the multi-billionaires the run today's economy would not be able to reach the heights that they have if they weren't protected by the laws that they influence. ",1,0,1443059104,1444724964

That's kind of a key point here. It's not am FDA problem to make your own Pyramethamine and sell it: that's an IP problem.

cvbm5ib,1,t3_3m374p,jstock23,"Well, what is a ""free market""? It means that people or companies can sell and trade property at prices they choose.

So, what is being traded in this market example? It's a manufactured drug. Where can you get this drug? Only from the company that owns the *intellectual property* to produce it exclusively. So, this is actually an example of where one company has a monopoly, the antithesis of ""competition"" in a ""free market"" that is always espoused to be beneficial by those who support a free market.

So, why is a free market normally supported by certain people? This is because if a number of companies offer the same product, they are insensitivized to undercut their competition and offer a superior product. That way, they get more market share and increased profits. They may choose these things for material reasons, but we all agree that lower prices and higher quality is ethical nonetheless. This is a major benefit people attribute to the free market, because it is done ""automatically"", without the need for someone to ""enforce"" it, which is in itself an issue.

Without this ""competition"", due to the exclusive intellectual property rights, the free market offers less benefit. While exorbitant prices will cause less people to purchase the drug at hand, it may still be beneficial, because the profit realized by the higher price may outweigh the lost nominal sales. Furthermore, with competition, only one company out of many is required to be ethical. If there were 100 companies offering this drug, and one was run by someone ethically motivated to sell the drug at a reasonable price to help people, they will gain the vast majority of market share for the product, and the other companies could be reasonably ignored.

So, is there a free market solution? Well, that depends on your definition of ""property"". Can the selling of a certain molecule be an exclusive property, just as someone with a tractor can use it how they feel, and then sell the corn they grow with it for any price they choose? Well, if you have a decent amount of money, you can hire engineers to build a new tractor, essentially from scratch, that does the job of a tractor. But in this case, you are barred from producing the molecules in the drug, in any way, even if it is done from scratch, because molecules are unique patterns found in the universe.

Intellectual property also applies to things like novels. You can't just take someone's book and print it out, then sell it. But nothing is stopping you from just writing your own book, maybe better, and then selling that. Both are books, perhaps in the same genre, with similar symbolism, characters, etc.

But you can't just make a similar AIDS drug, it's unique and any changes probably render it useless. So, the question I think should be asked is this: ""Is the idea that a certain molecule can be patented and deemed exclusive proper?""

On the one hand, it is argued that because these molecules are difficult to devise, the exclusive rights allow companies to make back their large investments in the discovery process. Without the ability to sell these drugs exclusively, someone else could just make the drug and sell it for a bit cheaper, so why would someone put in the time?

So, it all boils down to two paths: is a molecule fair game for intellectual property rights, or is it acceptable that certain types of investments can't be made back via the selling of an exclusive product? The latter idea would prevent this problem from happening, but then again, maybe it would have hindered the discovery process so the drug wouldn't be available in the first place.

Perhaps a compromise would be to shorten the copyright duration. This would mean that initial investors could, for a time, sell an exclusive product, making back the investment required to discover the chemical process and the molecule, and test it, etc. But then, after a time, they would lose that right and it would be open to others to produce in a free market, requiring just one single ethical company for the product to be offered at a reasonable price. I don't know the current duration of such things, but it may be reasonable to shorten it, if the public so decides.

In fact, one might argue that because other companies *aren't allowed* to make and sell the drug, that it isn't actually a free market. Governments restrict via force who can and can't make a product. A company could buy the raw materials, equipment, personnel, and testing to make the drug, without stealing any of these things, but once they put them together in a special way, the people at that company could be incarcerated. ""Property"" is a fairly interesting subject, because on the one hand you have ""physical property"", which the stealing of is widely agreed to be unethical. Physical property takes time and effort to gather or transport and store, whether it be from a mine or grown like cotton, but on the other hand you have ""intellectual property"", which is an abstract infinite resource. If you use physical property it diminishes, but if you use intellectual property it is unchanged.

However nothing will likely change soon, because these things take a while, but in the mean time, we still have tools, and arguably the most important tools. While the aforementioned issues are to do with Government and Public policy, we still have the tools of Society. We can agree that a certain act is unethical and do things like boycott a product, or publicly shame individuals. I don't mean to say that the following is desirable in the least amount, but if someone were to refuse to pay the ridiculous price of the AIDS drug and were to die from this, that would certainly do *something* on a societal level and pressure certain individuals with a conscience, or at least an interest in their business. The social aspect of humanity is often overlooked, and people instead fall back on using the force of government to accomplish their goals. Boycotting bus systems during segregation financially hurt the bus providers, was completely legal, and very effective.

Typically, a 'functional' free market requires two main elements. The first is that competitors are free to enter a market and innovate new, better business models. The second is that consumers are the ones making cost-value decisions.

The first criteria fails because the health care industry has been and continues to be one of the [most tightly and most complexly regulated industries in the US.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730786/) Note, I am not saying whether that should or should not be the case, I am simply stating that it is the case.

The second criteria fails on two fronts. First is the pervasiveness of third-party payer insurance (that just happens to be artificially tied to your work through tax incentives.) Considering what third-party payer insurance would do the [food industry is a worthwhile thought experiment.](https://mises.org/library/suppose-there-were-food-insurance)

The other way the second criteria fails is because individual consumers, paying either out of pocket or with insurance, [only make up about half of the health care market.](http://mercatus.org/publication/health-care-spending-united-states-affordable-care-act). Government spending through various programs accounts for the other half.

So as you can see, The healthcare market as a whole in the US fails to meet any criteria of a free market. So it's baseless to use the current failures of that market as arguments claiming that 'free market principles do not work in health care.'

Interestingly, there is a specific section of the health-care market that does satisfy those criteria: cosmetic surgery, [which has seen both improvements in quality and relative reductions in cost over the past decades.](http://healthblog.ncpa.org/why-cant-the-market-for-medical-care-work-like-cosmetic-surgery/)",5,0,1443033049,1444724992

It's actually a question of how the overseas distributor is handling its legal risks with reference to the mails. If they send it _as_  prescription medication they need to be registered with the FDA. If they send it as TOTALLY NOT MEDICATION FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION or whatever, they just need to follow state and federal law about poison control. 

So if an overseas company is telling you 'we can't mail this overseas' it's because they a.) don't want to shell out for a DEA certification b.) don't want to relabel everything as alternative medicine or c.) both. It's not because the DEA is directly coercing them. 

And if the mail isn't involved, what you do in a foreign country is your business. People travel abroad for medical care for reasons ranging from unjustifiabl eoversights (like when gender reassignment surgery wasn't available in the US) to the banal (cheap generics in Tiajuana) to the appalling (getting organs harvested from Chinese political prisoners).

The reason a *truly* free market would be important is that it would have price information that is set by the supply of and demand for a product instead of this information being manipulated or set arbitrarily by a bureaucrat. With accurate price information, proper economic planning can take place. The tricky thing any economy has to deal with is figuring out what the most economical use of goods is, how to make the most out of the least possible. Free market prices allow this to happen. If resources are demanded by consumers in one part of the economy more than the other, that part of the economy bids up the price, taking it away from other parts of the economy where it would be wasted on less highly valued ends. Free market prices allow businesses to figure out what their expenses and revenue are in the terms of the same good (money), which means they can figure out if they're making a profit or taking a loss. This is *extremely* important because it's only thanks to this profit and loss test that we're able to figure out if we're wasting resources or not. Without it, we'd be inefficient, left groping in the dark to try and find the right way.

If it's true what people say and free market principles cannot be applied to the medical industry, then this is a terrible thing. This means that the medical industry will be doomed to wastefulness, that it will be literally impossible to figure out what the best use of resources would be in this industry. Advancement would only be able to come, if it comes at all, by constantly banging our heads against the wall with constant uncertainty about whether we're making the right decisions, and in an industry where lives literally hang in the balance, I can't think of a more terrible fate.

Thankfully, there's no reason to think that free market principles can't apply. Medicine and medical plans can and are bought and sold just like all other goods in the economy. If this is capable of being bought and sold, which it clearly is even in our vastly manipulated market economy, then free market principles are capable of applying. 

Let's consider this case as if it had happened in a free market though. Either this new price is too high, too low, or just right. Presumably the belief right now is that it's too high. What does that mean?

If this price is too high, then the producer is really just shooting himself in the foot. If he's really just trying to make an extreme profit by putting the price of his goods at $1,000,000,000 per tablet, then the obvious outcome is that people *won't buy it*, or at least not buy it as much. He would actually make more money if he lowered his price down to a more reasonable level. Your revenue isn't just determined by your price, but price times quantity. A higher price means lower demand which means less quantity which means less profit.

But let's suppose this is an especially stupid man and doesn't realize that he's hurting himself. Then that just means that he's just *begging* other producers to undercut him. Entrepreneurs on the market are always out to look for ways to make money, and if there's a discrepancy as outrageous this appears to be, then it's just *begging* for other, smarter people to enter the market to compete with him and take up that profit for themselves. And like everywhere else on the market, more producers will mean a higher supply of this drug and a lower price. Again, seems like a good outcome to me.

So if it really is too high, the only outcomes are either that the market will naturally punish him for it, fining him for his outrageous tactic in proportion to how outrageous his price was, until he fixes it or someone else does.

If it's too low, which we find unlikely, he would again be hurting himself since he could be making more money at a higher price. A similar process would occur as we see above.

But let's take the other worry, that this is the genuine market price that we'll just be stuck with. In this case, yes, the high price would just be a necessary evil, and in the long run we'll do better with this than we would have by trying to ""fix"" it. This price would be so high only because either no one wants to buy this product in the first place, giving it a low demand, or the resources needed for producing it are even more desperately needed elsewhere in the economy, which means we're better off not wasting it by making more of this pill.

So while this is not an example of a free market system, if it were, we'd still be better off leaving it alone.",1,0,1443043903,1444725016

This article claims its not unusual, but calls it purchasing ""the rights"" which suggests a lack of market somehow.

Ok, I think I understand.
Drugs require FDA approval, even generics, getting that approval is expensive and time consuming, while getting approval for a generic version of an already used drug is faster and cheaper, the cost is still non-zero.

So, a company buys the rights to produce the approved drug without any currently approved generics (or buys the rights to all approved generics too) giving them a temporary, **government created** monopoly.

Finally, they (allegedly) claim the drug is really quite dangerous (sometimes true) and restrict access, claiming it is about reducing harm, critics claim it is about keeping generic drug makers from getting a sample so they can show the FDA their drug and this one is the same. (REMS has something to do with the FDA, but I am done researching this for tonight)


**It's not** an example of the evils of the free market, more one of how businesses dont hate government regulation because it restricts competition and raises profit margins. Or maybe how the private market can exploit the inefficiencies of government to make crazy profits.
