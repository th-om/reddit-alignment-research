3nlle9,Democrats: do you think your party should abandon or at least downplay gun control in the upcoming Presidential election?,89,littlebitsoffluff,"It is generally agreed upon, at least in certain circles (maybe not here), that gun control loses elections. Not all the time, but very often. This is because a great number of Democrats own guns, in addition to Republicans. 

Hillary has decided to touch the third rail, and in the last couple days has come out with new proposals to restrict gun ownership. Conservatives are overjoyed, because this tends to pull the pro-gunners together, since they are typically single-issue voters (much as the abortion issue is for the left). I know people who have already sent in donations to the NRA because of her statement.

Some might call Hillary's decision to ""go all in"" as unwise, but obviously she is playing to her base at this point, putting distance between herself and Sanders, who has a record somewhat more gun-rights friendly than Hillary. 

However, this simultaneously solidifies and reinforces opposition against her. She has given liberal/progressive gun owners who were thinking of voting for her--and yes, there are plenty of gun owners of that persuasion--a reason to stay home or vote for Sanders (though he's not been very gun-friendly recently either).

I've heard Democrats (and I used to be one, before the politics of gun control led me to leave the party) suggest that they'd wish that the gun control plank would be at least made less prominent during election cycles. It's a lost battle, they say, and continually pushing the issue just drives supporters aways, as the wedge issue it is. 

Democrats: do you agree or disagree with that assessment? Why or why not? Do you think it's possible that the Presidential election will turn one way or another on the topic of gun control? Is it a third rail that should be avoided?

EDIT: There are three planks in Hilary's recently proposed plan. One of them is to roll back laws disallowing gun manufactures to be sued; another is to make the three-day background check period a mandatory ""deny"" if the feds don't get back to the gun dealer before the time expires (which by the way was a compromise come up with to allow The Brady Act to pass, the rescinding of which would be seen as a betrayal of said compromise in gun owners' eyes), and a vague declaration to ban ""military type"" weapons.

I can assure you that each one of these three points is anathema to any gun rights proponents that are paying attention. It has nothing to do with ""taking away guns""; the three points above are plenty inflammatory enough.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nlle9/democrats_do_you_think_your_party_should_abandon/,PoliticalDiscussion,1444066989,1444717768
