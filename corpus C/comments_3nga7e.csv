Of course, if you actually analyze it, you could argue that he would not in fact do that, but nonetheless I think it's a good campaign slogan.

Bernie's, however, has nothing to do with Bernie.  It has no substance at all.

cvo70eb,0,t1_cvo4vnm,McSchwartz,">Opponents of the FTT often cite the negative experience of the Swedish transaction tax on equities that was in effect from 1984 to 1991 as proof that FTTs do not work. However, the existence of successful FTTs in many other countries proves that the Swedish experience is the exception and not the rule. It is now widely acknowledged that the problems with the Swedish FTT were related to design flaws, not the general concept of financial transactions taxes.

>A report by the International Monetary Fund to the G20 in September 2010 highlighted two major problems.

>1. The equities tax was only levied on trades conducted through registered Swedish brokers, making this tax easily avoided by using non-Swedish brokers. As a result, much of the trading of Swedish stocks moved to British brokers. In contrast, the UK Stamp Duty falls on the purchase of shares in UK-registered companies wherever they are traded in the world, because it’s payment is connected to the legal transfer of ownership, and can therefore not be avoided. Most investors are willing to pay a modest tax to ensure legal title to their asset.

>2. The tax on fixed-income trading activity, in effect from 1989-1990, resulted in a shift to other financial instruments that were not subject to the tax, such as corporate loans and swaps.

>The IMF’s conclusion from the Swedish experience was not that FTTs should be rejected, rather they advise that the tax base “should be set as comprehensively as possible in order to deter avoidance, and should also take advantage of legal and administrative handles ... to ensure compliance.”
