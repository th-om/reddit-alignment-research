>We live under a government that was specifically set up with a separation of powers and a branch that is not elected by the people, in part to protect minority rights and prevent tyranny of majority.

Roberts had this to say in his dissent

*Although the policy arguments for extending marriage to same-sex couples may be compelling, the legal arguments for requiring such an extension are not. The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a State change its definition of marriage. And a State’s decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational.*

*[T]his Court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us. Under the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be. The people who ratified the Constitution authorized courts to exercise “neither force nor will but merely judgment.*

Again, note that the right to marry was not restricted by any referendum, however the definition of what a a state may recognize as marriage was instead clearly defined. Many of the states that defined ""marriage"" in the traditional sense also had laws that allowed for the exact same rights through recognized civil unions of same sex couples.

This is a distinction without meaning. There are 1,138 statutory provisions in which marital status determines benefits, rights, and privileges. When you define marriage, you are excluding those who do not meet that definition of marriage from these benefits, rights, and privileges.

So by defining marriage as between one man and one woman, the states were effectively limiting the rights of same-sex couples.

> What makes restrictions on marrying someone of the same sex any different than these other restrictions?

A compelling government interest is the difference. A same-sex marriage ban could theoretically be constitutional if the state can demonstrate a compelling government interest to do so. In *Obergefell v. Hodges*, they failed to do that.

> Many of the states that defined ""marriage"" in the traditional sense also had laws that allowed for the exact same rights through recognized civil unions of same sex couples.

I'm not sure if you're intentionally trying to distort the truth, or you're ignorant. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume the latter.

* Civil unions in many cases did not grant the exact same rights as marriages. For example, civil unions in Wisconsin, Maine, and Colorado provided limited recognition of same-sex marriage, with limited rights.

* Only a handful of states offered civil unions. A little less than a third. All of them were blue or purple states. Conservative states (i.e. Texas) would not permit even the semblance of marriage in the form of civil unions.

> So why the need for lawsuits and a supreme court ruling that essentially overturns the ""will of the people"" in over 60% of the states ?

Because the ""will of the people"" is not the be-all and end-all of our constitutional republic. If the ""will of the people"" is in violation of the U.S. Constitution, it should be overturned.

As an aside, if it were truly the ""will of the people"" to ban gay marriage in the U.S., then it should be relatively easy to pass an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that defines marriage to that effect.

What a silly statement. Of course it was won by lawyers; it was argued by lawyers just like any other Supreme Court case. It was also won on the basis of law, specifically the 14th Amendment. 

The 14th amendment provides that state governments must not A) ""deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process,"" and B) ""deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law."" The Supreme Court found that same-sex marriage bans violated both the liberty and equality of same-sex couples. 

When deciding cases involving the infringement of a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, the state's actions must generally pass some form of heightened scrutiny. One of the requirements of this increased scrutiny is to establish that the action is justified by a legitimate government interest. In *Obergefell v. Hodges*, the states attempted to do that by claiming that same-sex marriages harmed traditional marriage by severing the link between procreation and marriage. The Supreme Court rejected that argument as ""counterintuitive"" and ""unrealistic."" Therefore, the states were not able to establish a legitimate state interest that allowed them to overrule the 14th Amendment rights of gay couples.

> Let's take this further...what compelling interest does the government have in restricting marriage to two people? What compelling interest does the government have in restricting marriage between a brother and sister?

I don't have firm positions on either of these issues. I would like to see the arguments of both sides of the issue. In particular, I would like to see what state interests can be used to justify these bans. 

One state interest I can come up with off the top of my head in regards to incest is an interest in protecting the genetic diversity of the population. Inbreeding has negative results on the health of a population such as: increased genetic disorders, higher infant mortality, lower birth rate, depression of growth rate, and loss of immune system function.

>However, you're trying to draw a false equivalency between same-sex marriage, polygamy, and incest. They are not all the same.

They are exactly the same in regards to ""equal protection"", and to suggest otherwise is a rationalization to justify a specific opinion. Even the dissenting opinions pointed this fact out. You could even make arguments in favor of ""age of consent"" laws as well, considering science on when we are fully capable of making ""adult"" decisions is subjective and that our bodies are generally capable of reproduction by the age of 14.

The people have the right to decide their own laws **within the bounds of the U.S. Constitution.** The Supreme Court stripped them of nothing. I will reiterate once again that just because a majority wants something doesn't make it constitutionally valid.

> I am sure that it was only a matter of time before most states made same sex marriage legal anyways because of the trends of popular opinion changing

I will quote Kennedy's opinion because I cannot put it in better words:

""The dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right...This is why 'fundamental rights may not be submitted to 
a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.' It is of no moment whether advocates of same-sex marriage now enjoy or lack momentum in the democratic process...Although 
Bowers was eventually repudiated in Lawrence, men and women were harmed in the interim, and the substantial effects of these injuries no doubt lingered long after Bowers was overruled. Dignitary wounds cannot always be healed with the stroke of a pen...Were the Court to stay its hand to allow slower, case-by-case determination of the required availability of specific public benefits to same-sex couples, it still would deny gays and lesbians many rights and responsibilities intertwined with marriage.""
