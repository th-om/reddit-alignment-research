For the smaller arsenals: There is no way in hell North Korea, Israel, India or Pakistan is going to dismantle their arsenals and give up the threat of annihilation on their regional rivals.

The UK is in a unique position. No country near it is threatening war, and it's protected by the US arsenal from the Russian nuclear threat.

Russia: aspire to be a world power again on par with the US, even if it's achievable.

China: also aspire to be a world power on par with US. Political discourse is also not exactly varied in China.

Pakistan and India: as long as one has nuclear weapons the other will.

North Korea: makes the country unpredictable and makes the US less likely to invade. Political discourse is also a tad one sided there.

Israel: they view nukes as key to their survival due to history of being invaded by others.

France does, France as on multiple occasions made it very clear they want to be treated as a great power, I think they might even want to claim superpower. Nuclear weapons put a state in a very exclusive club and get you taken seriously. The P5 aren't just the winners of WWII they also happen to be the main nuclear states (of course this wasn't planned). 

Of the other states with weapons. US is responsible for a nuclear umbrella of most of the planet. Russia can rely on its arsenal to ensure it won't ever be invaded. China's push to be a superpower is underwritten with nuclear weapons, and security from Obama.  

In addition you have the China-India-Pakistan triad where they each hate each other and aren't going to disarm as long as their enemy is armed. Of course you can also construct a US-Russia-China triad as well. ",3,0,1443904382,1444719573

There are still dozens of US-based disarmament activist groups including that time [five protesters including a nun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Gilbert) broke into an actual Minuteman silo in Colorado.

There was also considerable support by the Obama administration for [Global Zero's position](http://www.globalzero.org/get-the-facts/us-nuclear-strategy) culminating in a disarmament treaty with Russia that would have deactivated thousands of warheads but recent events have shelved a good part of that agenda.  (Russia has also been experimenting with kinetic weapons that pack a considerate kiloton payload with none of the radiation allegedly in violation of previous treaties.)

I can't speak as to the other countries especially India and Pakistan but it has been a come-and-go issue on the national agenda in America; many voters here might well presume that the threat of a nuclear war has dropped since 1991 but near misses and other horrible possibilities still present themselves.

Note that Israel still has yet to actually acknowledge its painfully obvious stockpile so we don't even know if it's increased or reduced; its leadership has gone with Patriot and Iron Dome missiles instead for deterrence of high volume dumbfire missiles used by Hamas and Hezbollah anyway with its only real regional threat on the brink of total disarmament.
