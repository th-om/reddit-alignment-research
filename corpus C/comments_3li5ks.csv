The government is entirely in charge of and responsible for every aspect of the private prisons it contracts with. The government has just as much responsibility to monitor and supervise private prison corporations, as it does to monitor and supervise government employees who operate state-owned prisons. 

Government pays a warden who runs a prison, or government pays a corporation which pays a CEO who runs a prison. In terms of government oversight, there's no difference at all.

cv6pybd,1,t3_3li5ks,tuna_HP,"I would say the argument against privately run prisons *could be* negated by really strong and thorough contracts (but isn't). 

People are concerned about perverse incentives, like that privately run prisons are rewarded for keeping people in prison as long as possible and having as many inmates as possible continue to commit crimes and get sent back to jail. It creates corporations that have an incentive to contribute to politicians to create stricter laws. Many people are uncomfortable with there being a profit motive at all, because there would be all these temptations. 

I think in some other countries where there isn't as much money in politics and where politicians are better held accountable, they produce the types of strong sophisticated contracts that could hold a private company to doing a good job running a prison. Like rewarding prisons for converting criminals to law abiding citizens. For example, people think of public transportation in America being a government run agency, like your local subway and Amtrak, but in Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, and many other places they actually outsource day-to-day operations to private companies.

Prisoners rights don't have nearly the same public support.

On the other hand, what the government is doing is legal, but are these private prisons also low-balling for contracts? I assume it's their business model.

That is incorrect.  A for-profit prison wants less unless they want more prisons.  The ""more"" comes from overburdening public prisons so that they turn to private ones to make up the costs.

Perhaps you are unclear of how they work.  They don't build facilities and hope people show up.  They either sign a contract with a county or state to build a facility or take one over from the state.

The terms of the contracts vary wildly by state, some states require cost savings others do not.  Most require a charge a minimum 90% occupancy whether there is one prisoner or 90%.  from 90%-100% will be billed regularly.  It is in their favor to have a prison with one prisoner in it.  Then they need less guards, less food, less medicine, less everything while still getting paid as if the prison was at 90% capacity.

They jockey for new laws and bills not to fill their prisons, but so the public prison system gets overburdened with prisoners.  Then they can come sweeping in and save the day.
