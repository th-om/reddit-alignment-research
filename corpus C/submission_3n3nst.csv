* [A rapidly growing population](http://www.limitstogrowth.org/WEB-Graphics/CaliforniaPopulation1900-2010-PPIC.png) (e.g. washing, lawns, consumption)

* Industry (the jobs the people work at)

* [Farming](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/06/california-drought-water-produce-fruit-vegetables) (jobs, healthy food (e.g. fruits and vegetables) that people eat throughout the country)

* [Environmentalist Needs](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/apr/17/sacramento-drought-california-environment-water/) (e.g. stop pumping from a river and allow the water to go into the Pacific so a fish species in the river does not die due to water levels being too low)

Droughts in California are predicted to become worse as global climate change advances.  This means that the current drought will not be the worst, but that worst is still to come.

People need food (farming), jobs (industry, farming), and water for personal use (e.g. car washes, showers).  The environment is important too.
