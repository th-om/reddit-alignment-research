cvhuxl6,0,t1_cvhb6du,Big_sumo,"Lots of them did.  They just always supported universal coverage through a private system, and democrats always supported single payer.   Reddit is full of people who were barely alive before the Obama era, and most other people have a short memory.  Truth is it was often supported by republicans until Obama did it.  Not all republicans but many, including nearly all the leaders of the party.  Bob Dole did.  Newt Gingrich did.   I get downvoted everytime I point this out, but its true.  Even more recently Romney supported it as recently as 2009 when he specifically argued for a universal coverage with an individual mandate http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/mitt-romneys-advice-for-obamacare-look-at-romney#.tdZ2E9Xbq
