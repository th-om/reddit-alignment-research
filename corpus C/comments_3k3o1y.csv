Not to say that makes it wrong in any means, but of course they're going to talk about Trump being a much stronger candidate that Clinton, even though [ only one poll to says so.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/president/)",12,0,1441727295,1444731568
cuv1hp1,0,t1_cuui8uk,hatramroany,"Plus it's a poll. With a 3.3% margin of error so the reality could be Clinton 43.3, Trump 41.7 (I think that's how errors work, it's been a few years) plus the 15% undecideds. Lets say they break 2:1 in favor of Clinton for the sake of the argument. She wins 53.3 to 46.7 based on this poll. This is why we don't trust single polls as the bible.",1,0,1441757840,1444731568

They'd support just about anyone or any thing over Clinton.  They'd trumpet the virtues of a jar of mayonnaise over Clinton if it were leading the polls.",-1,0,1441808248,1444731568
cuvlsrv,0,t1_cuvlb9v,evanb_,"That's absolutely not true. Have you even read the National Review? It's conservative, not Republican.

If Trump won the nomination, they would certainly refuse to endorse a candidate as they did in 1960 and 2012. They even went against the incumbent Nixon in '72 by endorsing Ashbrook.",1,0,1441809083,1444731568

cuuihlf,1,t3_3k3o1y,bit99,"this survey uSA poll is reliant upon landlines and coming up with some odd numbers. For example the 25% of black vote (and 31% of Hispanics) just seems made up. Trump's completely underwater with Hispanics according to Gallup and while he is a different type of candidate, blacks have voted for the last 4 GOP candidates in the single digits.
