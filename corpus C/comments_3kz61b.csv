cv1s3gh,1,t3_3kz61b,houinator,"Most terrorist groups are eventually defeated not by (solely) military force, but by being brought into the political process.  The truth is the Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria have legitimate grievances against their respective governments, and even if you killed every ISIS member today, those regions would still be hotbeds of insurgency tomorrow.  

Iraq has a chance at a diplomatic resolution, as Prime Minister Abadi is making moves to distance Iraq from being a pure Iranian client state.  However its a slow process, which will obviously be impacted by what is going on in Syria.  If Abadi is successful though, he may win over the core of ex-Baathists that make up ISIS's most effective tactical commanders, as they are not fully invested in the ISIS ideology.

Syria on the other hand will have an insurgency of some sort for the foreseeable future (whether they call it ISIS or something else), as Assad has made it clear that the only negotiations he is interested in are ones where he concedes nothing substantial (as has Iran).  With the recent Russian intervention, the EU's fears about the migrant crisis, and Iran's increased funding under the JCPOA, his cards have only been strengthened, so he is unlikely to change course.  The Russian/Iranian/Syrian plan has been one of using ethnic cleansing to preserve the vital areas of Syria, and to some extent that has been pretty successful; but to end the insurgency completely would require mass slaughter on a scale that even the EU would eventually balk at.

And then you have to consider that even if ISIS is driven completely from Iraq and Syria, they are now a global organization like Al Qaida, with subordinate groups throughout Africa and Asia, so the leadership will have places to retreat to even if their birthplace is no longer a viable base of operations.

It may have been that way a few years back when groups like ISIS were more reliant on the locals to provide them support under the table, but now they are controlling and governing territory and calling the shots. 

>but to end the insurgency completely would require mass slaughter on a scale that even the EU would eventually balk at.

I'm wondering how much of this Putin has in mind, now that he's moving significant forces into Syria. Do you see the Russian intervention as something the U.S. should ride out and go along with, or are there bigger dominoes in play here beyond support for Assad that we should be concerned about?",1,0,1442298009,1444728782

Yes, but wasn't that due to the fact that Saddam Hussein (a Sunni) was in power in Iraq up to 2003?

> There are also religious considerations, the Shia in Iraq largely don't take their marching orders from Khamenei.

Don't you mean *ethnic* considerations, though? After all, it's the *ethnic* differences which separate Iraqi *Arab* Shiites from *Iranian* Shiites.

Also, though, here is an interesting question for you (and for the other people here)--if I was an ex-Baathist who is currently working for ISIS, then wouldn't it be to my advantage to demand that *the entire* ""ISIS Caliphate"" be incorporated into Iraq (as a part of a loose Iraqi federation and perhaps with a right of secession after 50 or 100 years (after most or all of Iraq's oil will run out))? After all, this will allow the Iraqi Sunnis to get a share of Iraq's oil revenues *and also* strengthen their position in Iraq by significantly increasing Iraq's Sunni Arab population. (Plus, this might give them the opportunity to secede from Iraq after most or all of Iraq's oil reserves will run out.)

Any thoughts on this?",1,0,1442278405,1444728782

No, I was mostly thinking of the influence of Sistani, and to a lesser extent Muqtada al Sadr (Who has been pushing back against the Iranians more and more lately).

OK; also, thanks for clarifying this part. :)

Would you have said back in 2000 that there is a realistic scenario in which the U.S. would have invaded both Afghanistan and Iraq, though?",1,0,1442279511,1444728782
cv1rs0e,1,t3_3kz61b,only_your_opinion,"Decades?  Anyone tells you anything of what it will look like decades from now are flat out guessing.  That is way too hard to predict in a region that is:

a) unstable
b) valuable to the Western world for a variety of reasons

Typically I would consider ISIS a warlord type structure, which could go on for decades if left unchecked.  But already that has not happened.  (see reason B)  

Plus, there are really too many variables.  

What happens if Iran becomes moderate, or decides to be lord protector of the region?

What happens if or when Syria collapses creating yet another power vacuum?

What would happen if Turkey feels threatened and decides to put it's full weight into fighting ISIS?

What if Israel feels threatened?

Fair question, but for a decades question we are just honestly making shit up at that point.
