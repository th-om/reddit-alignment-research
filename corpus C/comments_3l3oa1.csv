If Romney won 71% of the Latino vote, he would have still lost. If just 4% more whites voted, he would have won. Latinos are only about 8% of registered voters, concentrated in non-swing states such as Texas, California, and New York.

Democrats don't even have the young white vote; a majority of white male and female millennials voted for Romney in 2012.
