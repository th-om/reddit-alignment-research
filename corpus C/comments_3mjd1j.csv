That's a funny article. Let me quote [Nate Silvers from 2007](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/12/06/418493/-National-Polls-Don-t-Matter-Here-s-the-Proof#):

>> New Hampshire polls are a leading indicator to national polls.  Voters are more engaged and more informed in New Hampshire than they are nationally.   As the primary season progresses, voters continue to become better engaged and informed, until the actual voting takes place, when the voters are presumably as informed as they ever will be.

>> In other words, if a candidate is doing better in New Hampshire polls than he is in national polls, that suggests that as voters become more informed, they will continue to slide toward that candidate.  At so the candidate will do well in the voting booth, at which point all voters are highly informed (relatively speaking, at least).  On the other hand, if a candidate is doing better nationally than he is in New Hampshire, that suggests that the candidate may not hold up to scrutiny, that he may be trading primarily on name recognition, etc.  His support is superficial.  

>> The litmus test of this then becomes Iowa.  If a candidate is doing better in New Hampshire polls than he is in national polls, and that candidate does well in Iowa, that provides very powerful evidence that this increase in information works to the benefit of that candidate. 

Strange how, now that it's not 2007 and Nate Silvers is editing rather than writing, 538 is drawing almost exactly the opposite conclusion of what Nate Silvers concluded in 2007.

Also, Bernie Sanders is winning or competitive in a bunch more states than those two.",-2,0,1443365899,1444723219

So, what are his predictions for the results of each state primary? If he'll post his analysis and methodology for that the way he has for so many other topics (like the post I linked, which actually included regression analysis, for example), I'll take it seriously.

Simply pointing out that the first two primary/caucus states - where he has focused most of his efforts, to date - are both white and liberal, isn't serious analysis. Hell, his ""Bernie could lose everywhere else"" article even acknowledged that there is another interpretation - the one Silver himself advanced in 2007:

>> One theory to explain these numbers is that Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats are early adopters of Sanders’s populist-left message. It isn’t a bad theory. 

But he doesn't actually provide any reason to accept the analysis he pushes in the article over his own alternative explanation.

>  just like the data is currently showing

At this point in 2007, the data showed Hillary Clinton beating Barack Obama (indeed, by more than she's beating Sanders by today).

At this point in 2007, the data showed Fred Thompson and Rudy Giuliani fighting over the lead in the Republican nomination.

At this point in 2011, the most recent polls which had been released had Rick Perry winning.

You *can* try to predict the outcome of races using only the current polling data from the September before, but if you do, you're likely to end up looking like a fool.

cvfyv7i,0,t1_cvfxzg1,NonHomogenized,"> Good, we agree he has pretty much no chance

I don't agree he has ""pretty much no chance"", though. 

First, I gave him ""little"" chance of winning a month ago, and quantified it at somewhere between 10-20% back in late July, and I don't agree that even 10% is ""pretty much no chance"": it's fundamentally different from someone like Lawrence Lessig or Martin O'Malley, who really *don't* have any real chance of winning (I would put the odds of *either* of them winning well below 1%).

Moreover, those were statements I made a month ago, and I revise my views in light of new evidence. When I quantified his chances at 10-20%, he was polling nationwide at 17%, and Hillary at 56%: today those numbers are more like 27% and 43%, and there are still 4 months (and all of the debates) before the first primaries, and basically 5 months until the first ones Bernie isn't currently competitive or winning in. The situation has changed, and I'd be a fool to leave the odds where I set them a month or two ago. If I had to guess today, I'd say he's still more likely than not to lose... but he's followed basically the same overall nationwide trajectory as Obama so far (though with different demographics, to date). I'd say that even the lowest reasonable estimate has got to put his chances at 20% now, and somewhere north of 1 in 3 would seem pretty reasonable to me: I feel like 40% is pushing the bounds of a reasonable upper estimate, but maybe not by much. And I *certainly* wouldn't call that ""pretty much no chance"": I'd call it a pretty decent, but not (yet) great, chance.
