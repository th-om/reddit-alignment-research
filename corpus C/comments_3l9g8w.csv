His approach to politics is possible because his policies are not moderate and are already limited in their appeal.  A moderate who approaches politics the way Sanders does just doesn't come across very well.  They offend enough of both sides' bases to prevent the forming of a coalition of voters capable of winning an election.  They can hold a strong middle 20% of the electorate, and some have in the past.  But, that's not enough when a more extreme candidate can start with the far left or right 40% and still siphon off a couple of points from you.

Hahahaha, I love this.  This is why many people think reformists are a joke, and honestly I agree.

But the only alternative to a reformist is a revolutionary, so they wouldn't participate in politics.

Theres actually 2 ways a leftist could do it... One is try to humanize the current shstem enough and push for eventual abolishment of capitalism, or they could increase the number of contradictions in capitalism and purposely let it run rampant so there is a pro socialist movement.


Positions that I think they would hold:
Anti imperialist: restrict foreign intervention and support non imperialist societies such as Palestine and the Kurds

Nationalization and collectivization:  This is still possible in a capitalist framework.  Try to create 'commons' for the people and operate some things through the state for those people

Pro worker:  set of policies that are pro worker, worker cooperatives (Mondragon) restrictment on how much money goes to capitalists, etc

Wage adjustments:  policies that try to get workers to be paid for how much they work as opposed to being exploited for labor.  Not necessarily minimum wage increase but that helps.  Restrict capitalist salary

Support factions:  aid domestic and foreign factions that are socialist or are helpful to socialist interests.  A far left politician would try to spread ideology across the globe

Race and sex biased policies: Affirmative action type positions, scholarships based on race and sex, benefits based on this.  

Class biased policies:  Like the above, except based on socioeconomic class.  

Pro Environmental regulations: self explanatory

Anti fascist/reactionary: ensure that fascist groups get little power attention or representation. Contain its spread.

Guns: generally socialists are pro guns, but I don't think this is a big deal if determining if someone is left

Anti austerity: self explanatory

Reduce military: self explanatory

Anti big business: break up big businesses and their options

cv4j70j,0,t1_cv4i4fc,DevonWeeks,"Alright, that's a good start.  I mean, I'm not a socialist, not even close.  So I obviously would disagree with doing this stuff.  But, at least I understand better what you mean.  This part puzzles me, though...

>restrictment on how much money goes to capitalists
  
>Restrict capitalist salary
  
Who is a capitalist?  Are you defining capitalist as anyone with the resources to start a business or own a certain amount of assets?  

And...

>ensure that fascist groups get little power attention or representation. Contain its spread.
  
I'm also not a fascist, so it doesn't turn my stomach to think of stopping its spread.  But, are you talking about active political persecution?  That's where things get fuzzy, because it sounds like that's precisely what you're after, the active political persecution and oppression of groups based on class and political ideology.  People frequently associate, rightly or wrongly, violent oppression with the concepts of socialism and communism, and when you outline these sorts of policies it's kind of hard to imagine any explanation that would ease those fears.  You've essentially said, ""I want to isolate people based on ideology and assets and eliminate their political influence.""

Just keep an eye on Trump. Outside of immigration his policies are very moderate. He should be releasing his tax plan soon. Based on everything he's said so far expect lower taxes for poor and middle class and higher taxes on the rich and/or eliminating loopholes for the rich.
