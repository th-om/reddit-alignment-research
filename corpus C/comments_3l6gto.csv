> Such as Ellen Pao (this is not anti-Pao circlejerk and I would love for people to keep their opinion of her work at Reddit out of the conversation), where she claimed that Kleiner Perkins discriminated against her due to her gender. This was a case where many on the left, mostly feminists, proclaimed that this was a slam dunk and it represented women in professional settings. After discovery, it came to light that she had grossly exaggerated her contributions to the firm and had several years of very low performance reviews with a material amount of personal conflicts with a large number of coworkers, subordinates, and managers. 

You know you just made that all up to start an anti-Ellen Pao circlejerk, right?

In reality, Pao was highly regarded at the firm and had excellent performance reviews there.  She proved in court that the firm discriminated against her.  She proved in court that the firm had bad attitudes towards women in general.  What she didn't prove by a preponderance of the evidence was that the firm discriminated specifically against her specifically because she was a woman.  If her lawsuit had been ""meritless"" her lawyers would have been legally required not to take it on and the judge would have thrown it out at the beginning rather than proceeding to the end.

Actually, I wanted to end either response about Ellen Pao so it would be a discussion beyond Reddit.

None of this is supported by fact.  If you wish to continue this, you need to prove legitimate sources to these statements.  ",-2,0,1442433585,1444727887

I am not slandering anyone.  

The jury specifically stated that they came to the outcome based on her slipping performance reviews.

[After the verdict, three jurors told Reuters they had focused on Pao's increasingly negative performance reviews, which undermined her argument that she deserved to be promoted.](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/23/kleiner-lawsuit-idUSL1N0XK2K720150423)

You know, despite the fact that violent attacks on police are the lowest they have ever been.  They don't say that, though... instead they play up the one or two attacks on police they can find, bring in cops to talk about how scary the world is, and let the ignorant bastards watching draw their own (completely fucking wrong) conclusions.

And when Fox does it, what they are really opposing is reform that would protect citizens from police.  So I have to wonder, what is the real agenda of the person posting this?",8,0,1442418373,1444727887

I was asking a question if anyone feels that the recent wave of meritless high profile sexual discrimination lawsuits will hamper the feminist movement (or at least the perception of the movement) or discourage legitimate sexual discrimination lawsuits.   That is it.

There is a degree of gender discrimination that can be addressed, but that degree if far less than the feminist movement claims. They seem to think we are still living in the 50s and 60s, and the hyper reactionary combative nature of the movement (including being overly eager to push stories like the ones you reference) is not something people like. When feminism can learn to approach their problems rationally, they will see that causing change effectively will be much easier.

As for future lawsuits, I imagine they will still be taken seriously enough.  The public might show a degree of skepticism, but if women have legitimate complaints I don't think there is anything that would stop them from being considered seriously.

cv3vkwn,0,t1_cv3jwbf,Huey_McDuck,"I agree almost entirely. 

Its very disheartening to see high profile cases that proclaim victory before the trial really starts and turns out to be an employee with no basis looking for money.   

The Jefferies case is interesting to me because she refused to contact HR, her boss, or their hotline on the subject and rather decided to herself that the alleged situation wouldn't be resolved.  So she quit.  Then more than a year later she sued, with no specifics save one that already has been proven to not be valid (*ski trip*).   

I would hope that instead of proclaiming victory, feminist groups would instead use this as an opportunity to explain how to reasonably and intellectually resolve the situation without legal action - such as telling the offending parties that they are being offensive, then discussing the alleged situation with a manager/boss, filing complaint with HR, etc.    ",0,0,1442433895,1444727887
