3mpwt2,Aggregate national polling paints a dismal picture for Hillary Clinton's trajectory. Are people (here and in the media) overestimating her strength in the Democratic primary?,35,Miskellaneousness,"Disclosure off the bat: I'm a Bernie supporter, but this post is not intended to argue that Bernie will win based on Hillary's performance (I think he remains a long-shot), but instead that Hillary is weaker than many think in the Democratic race.

I've seen many argue (on this forum and in the media) that while Hillary has had a rough summer, her position is still incredible strong based on prediction markers such as national endorsements, money raised, and national polling. Further, some see Sanders as too liberal to be electable, and thus see Hillary as essentially running against herself unless Biden jumps in.

No one can dispute that she has the money and the endorsements, and is generally well positioned as there is no establishment candidate like Obama in 2008 that she could lose to.

But holy moly. Look at the trajectory of her aggregate national polling:

Her numbers are steadily and rapidly falling. Obviously there's a floor to this...somewhere. But she'll probably break into the 30s in early or mid-October. If her support continues to decline, isn't it likely that endorsements will slow down, money will slow down, etc? And is there any reason to believe her support will level out any day now as more email news comes out?

I think the money and endorsements she earned by virtue of being an incredibly strong candidate at the beginning of the summer belie her current strength.

Am I wrong?

TL;DR - Hillary is leading on nearly all 'prediction markers', but she is almost freefalling in the polls. Based on her polling trajectory, are the prediction markers off the mark?",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mpwt2/aggregate_national_polling_paints_a_dismal/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443459202,1444722841
