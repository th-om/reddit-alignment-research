The college said they had the requisite pledges, but in fact one of the pledges was actually a bequeath, which is technically different. According to Mrs sanders, she thought it was a pledge, but again, it was a bequeath (whatever that means).

She included bequeathed funds in pledged funds.  Before reading this article, could you have described the difference between these two?

The school didn't default on the loan, it instead sold off some of the real estate to pay off the loan.

$200k isn't a golden parachute.  It was a severance package deal reached between her and the school in order for their joint breaking of her contract.

Also, I tend to avoid putting much weight to news stories from publications using sources who say ""I know that for a fact because I’m friends with a member of the board who was on the board at the time.""
