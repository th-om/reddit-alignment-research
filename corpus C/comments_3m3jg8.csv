cvbnlnj,0,t1_cvbnbzj,lollersauce914,"Yeah, but I was thinking about this plan vs. other ways of representing DC in the federal government. This one isn't better than, say, straight up DC statehood, in part because it (unlike DC statehood) undermines the independence of the capital. 

Obviously, yeah, some people would prefer DC to not be represented at all, lol.",3,0,1443034152,1444724882

cvborcr,1,t3_3m3jg8,FacelessBureaucrat,"Honestly, because Maryland doesn't want them.

cvc3bc9,1,t3_3m3jg8,Eroticawriter4,I don't think it would really solve anything. It would cause the same political problems as admitting DC as a state. The same people (mostly) who fight against DC statehood would fight against that just as much.,1,0,1443058923,1444724886
cvcf5h1,1,t3_3m3jg8,avatoin,"How does this make since? DC is not Maryland. It's like saying why not just have Puerto Rico represented by Florida? Or why not just recombinant West Virginia with Virginia, that State as existed independent of Virginia for less time than DC has existed. 

DC is not Maryland, DC residents don't consider themselves a part of Maryland, and Maryland doesn't consider it as owners of DC. People seem to get hung up on the idea that DC's land once existed as part of Maryland, that makes it practically Maryland. 

Parts of Maryland and northern Virginia are more practically a part of DC than vice versus. DC has such an influence in this area because a large portion of the population lives there as a suburb of DC. 

So I say seed parts of Virginia and Maryland to DC and make that a State. It'd at least make more scene. ",1,0,1443092169,1444724886

Imagine if you wanted to increase funding to the local public library. Everyone in your town agrees its a good idea and they're all willing to use their taxes to fund it.
