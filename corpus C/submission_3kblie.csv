3kblie,"On reddit there is this huge thing about the fact that ""insiders"" are not to be trusted as president or as a congressperson, or that full time politicians are bad. I feel this opinion is very naive.",12,AMatterofTrust,"   I would in fact say you **want** seasoned or ""career"" politicians in congress and the white house. People on this subreddit and others seem to have a liking for Florina, Carson, and while people criticize Trump, any liking they take to him is because Trump is a non-insider. Which basically boils down to, we like, or maybe not agree with but at least sympathize with, these people **because they are not experienced.**


   Jimmy Carter advocated as an outsider. Jimmy Carter was a very weak president. While his economic crisis dates back to Nixon era price and wage controls (many economic crisis really stem from actions presidents made decades ago), the economic crisis was predicted and yet still Jimmy Cater did not know how to stop it. He was weak on foreign policy, his attitude towards ""a foreign policy run by morals"" sounds good but we now know that that was incredibly naive statement considering we were in the middle of the cold war.  


   And yet I do not deny, nor should anyone deny, he was a good person. He is an exemplary individual, evidenced by his post presidency work. And yet he was a weak president. And while Barack Obama has slightly more experience and time in public office, he too did not work with congress well at all, his failure to build relations among republicans led to the republicans being obstructionist and made compromise politically impossible, and his failure to build relations among democrats led to them breaking away from Obama, as evidenced by the whole trade deal fiasco and what is happening now with the Iran deal. While he succeeded in both these measures, it was a lot harder politically to impact change than it used to be, in every other case with trade deals the party always fell in line, and now it did not. 


   And I do not doubt that Obama is a great person. But part of being a great president is being able to maneuver the system well, which as shown people with a little bit of experience simply cannot do, and thus people with no experience will do even worse. It is not only having good ideas it is impacting change. Undoubtedly Hilary would be much better at impacting change than Bernie Sanders, that's not to say he should not be president, but that burden should fall on Sanders, not on Clinton by disparaging her with complaints of connections. 


   Additionally the rel world is not the idealized fiction that every person, whether he be Sanders, Bush, Rubio, Obama, or Clinton runs on. And most of the time the real world demands a more complex understanding of the world than they present in their fiction. [Case in point](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/10/01/9-attempts-to-explain-the-crazy-complexity-of-the-middle-east/). Economic writing from academic journals, not blogs. A well developed understanding of the bureaucracy of government, which is often extremely complex. Public officials are not expected to know all this, but they should have a basic understanding in order to be able to translate what advisers say into a proper bill. 


   The 113th congress passed 296 laws. And that was the least productive congress ever. This also ignores agency imposed regulation, executive actions and orders, and a bunch of other things. While it was the least productive congress, **it was 296 bills.** And while a few were naming post offices, the rest were all solutions to problems. It is not enough to have an opinion on each of those 296 bills. One has to come up with the solution presented in the bill. And because of the partisanship of the 113th congress, these bills were uncontroversial, meaning the solution was non-obvious and agreeable by all. When Obama issues an executive order, he mentions a few things that we understand, but others we don't. And while advisers write this and help the president out, the president still has to know a lot about the subject matter and has to be willing to look at reality as a basis for his decisions.


   So a president needs to be able to maneuver the system well, have a working knowledge of both conflicts we know and don't know, to which advisers can build upon, and he/she needs to be able to understand the massive bureaucracy the government is in. 

   What I feel most people do not understand is that governing is about *far* more than having an opinion. Governing means managing the day to day affairs of the government. Most of what a representative from the house does is helping citizens do things, like filling out tax forms, ect... A senator meets with various groups regarding policy in their state and the country. Presidents manage the many organizations under them. After all, being a president is a full time job, and they don't pass laws every day. 


   So should you make an outsider president? Or a senator? They may claim that they know the plight of the American citizen, but can they impact change? Do they really believe that they know it better than seasoned economists, and are they willing to listen to those economists, as Rubio and Clinton have done? Do they understand the bureaucracy of the government, and can they physically manage the government, not just have an opinion on certain laws. 


   I would argue that experience is very important, and that to a certain extent it trumps policy. I would also argue that career politicians are not bad, but can be good, and that the arguments disparaging politicians for their ""connections"" in government are completely misguided. I would also argue that far from wanting an outsider, you should want a seasoned politician, you should want an insider.
