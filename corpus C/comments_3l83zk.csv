cv408bj,1,t3_3l83zk,houinator,"Well you are asking this on Reddit, and a lot of redditors on the political subs agree with those talking points (though the complete non-interventionist stance has lost some popularity with the rise of ISIS).

What I would ask is, are there any indications that Sanders support for Corbyn has to do with his foreign policy views?  I know Sanders has a very different stance on Israel for example.",4,0,1442440725,1444727798

cv42hqq,1,t3_3l83zk,ForeignPolicyHawk,Jeremy Corbyn is an actual Socialist - and he's the type of person Americans associate with that word. That's why Bernie Sanders can't win. ,3,0,1442444495,1444727798

cv4494q,0,t1_cv42hqq,Captainobvvious,"That's what people don't get. 

He's been running incredibly hard without Clinton really running yet AND without anyone attacking him. 

Every gain he has made has been while running unopposed basically with nobody attacking him. 

In the face of well funded and active competition and getting actually attacked it would be a different game.

cv481d8,0,t1_cv44z2y,ForeignPolicyHawk,Yeah but Corbyn is a real socialist and it sets up an easy comparison. You can't call yourself something and not expect a comparison. ,3,0,1442454167,1444727798

cv40nm0,1,t3_3l83zk,muirmoffatt,"Honestly if this story gains traction and sticks I think it could really hurt Bernie.  But the if is huge because i guarantee 90% of Americans have never heard of Corbyn let alone know anything about him.  But if there is one things Americans hate is people from other countries telling us how wrong we are, sometimes even when we agree with them. Bernie showing support will definitely annoy many center-left democrats if they get word, don't even get me started with republicans.",1,0,1442441418,1444727798
cv417qa,1,t3_3l83zk,Zep_Rocko,Bernie Sanders is an economic leftist first and foremost. It doesn't seem unreasonable that he would support someone with similar views.,-1,0,1442442337,1444727798
