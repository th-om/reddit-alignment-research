What's happening is that as the situation has changed from where it was in 2012 when Assad was the least-liked target in Syria to now when that position is occupied by ISIS. The U.S. is slowly realizing that they can't remove Assad without giving ground to ISIS so they are continuing to let things play out while focusing military efforts against ISIS.

That is what the administration [wanted](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/31/president-obama-says-us-must-act-on-syria/) to do. In fact ISIS very conveniently got going and powerful just as soon as the US leaders realized it didn't have political support for direct war against Assad and suddenly *poof* there is a comic book villain enemy named ISIS.


Its just too convenient. I expect that going to [war](http://news.yahoo.com/obama-hopes-finesse-controversy-over-ground-troops-070606377.html) against ISIS will be the excuse to remove Assad and start Iraq part 2.",-6,0,1442251122,1444728970

You realize that nothing in that link indicates any sort of interest in an alliance with ISIS, right? 

ISIS was always fighting in the Syrian civil war as a growing presence, as a new form of AQI coming over the border. Guess you just weren't paying attention at the time. 

Ridiculous claims about the U.S. supporting ISIS will remain ridiculous until some modicum of evidence is presented. ",13,0,1442253263,1444728970
cv1dii8,0,t1_cv1d9qx,Ben_Afflock,">Ridiculous claims about the U.S. supporting ISIS will remain ridiculous until some modicum of evidence is presented. 

You are intentionally misinterpreting what I said.

* The US leaders want war against Bashar Assad, leader of Syria
* US doesn't have political support for another ground war
* Suddenly ISIS gets US weapons, and vehicles after taking it from northern Iraq; which is an outright violation of the ordinary practice of scuttling and destroying munitions before enemies get them

* Suddenly very fake looking videos start coming out with western and Hollywood in particular filming style. Middle Eastern film style is usually less intricate than Western style and these ISIS videos are hilariously high budget involving multiple moving cameras. Simply put they were produced by westerners knowledgeable with deep intricacies of modern production not usually seen in the Middle East

* It is not hard to imagine the administration would ask for war against ISIS of some kind, and its just too convenient that they might get to take out Bashar Assad as well.",-4,0,1442253637,1444728970
cv1f63u,0,t1_cv1dii8,thatoneguy82101,"In regards to your third point, it's completely laughable. They captured tons of equipment from the Iraqi military because the Iraqis just left, often without even consulting their higher ups or having any real orders to retreat. The first thing on their minds was their own survival, not destroying all of their equipment. 

Your fourth point is also ridiculous. Your claim is essentially ""Middle Easterners do not know how to make high quality videos"". Which is too inane to even bother arguing against.",4,0,1442256178,1444728970
cv1e9yd,0,t1_cv1dii8,thatnameagain,"Well if I'm misinterpreting what you said then I guess I don't know what kind of conclusion you are trying to imply here. It's not some mystery why ISIS was able to capture weapons in Iraq or why they have access to mid-level consumer grade video equipment (that's all it takes to make those videos, it's really not that fancy. I don't know why terrorist videos previously were all shot on what appears to be 90's camcorders).

The administration has already asked for war against ISIS, we're already fighting it. Thousands of bombing missions so far against ISIS, not a single one against Assad. Yes, sure, the U.S. wishes it could take out Assad as well but they're no longer oblivious to the power vacuum problem. ",4,0,1442254807,1444728974

cv20c6u,1,t3_3kxei5,CUDawg30,Honestly the United States is in a weakened state in foreign affairs right now. We have sold out our allies in the Syrian Civil War. We are not fully supporting the Kurds that have been very loyal to American policy in Iraq and the only true fighting force that has battled ISIS on the regular.
