cvg18fn,1,t3_3mlor9,ScoobiusMaximus,"He would probably be in the top 5 candidates but that doesn't mean much. He would pull the support from Bush and kasich, possibly even force kasich out. Someone would be kicked out of the top 10 candidates, probably Christie since Romney also pulls support from him. 

Trump or Fiorina might see a small drop because he takes some of their supporters who like CEO experience but would prefer a more moderate or establishment candidate, but he won't hurt them like he does Bush, Kasich or christie. I doubt he would win the primary but he could make it farther than most others.",6,0,1443379847,1444723185

cvgceik,1,t3_3mlor9,Cutlasss,He'd probably win the nomination. And then lose the election. None of the other candidates are really well liked within the party as a whole. ,1,0,1443397896,1444723189
cvgehgr,1,t3_3mlor9,NarrowLightbulb,"No way he can be popular in this atmosphere. Jeb and Rubio (maybe even Kasich, its still early) already have the establishment ticket locked and Romney has no chance getting support from anywhere else with people like Trump, Carson, Cruz, etc competing. If he did happen to join in I can see him around the middle of the pack poll at best.",1,0,1443401864,1444723189

cvgholb,0,t1_cvghbr0,Foxtrot56,If you don't think that negatively impacted him than you are far out of touch with reality.
