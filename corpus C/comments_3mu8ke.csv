I however lose no sleep at night over the concept of a Pell Grant, considering it's such a tiny portion of the overall budget and even the Department of Education budget which has ballooned since 2009.

With regards to student loans, it's been rather unfortunate to millions of students who were granted loans to study subjects that will never be able to pay the loans back in any reasonable timeframe. In my estimation it's a rather disgusting money grab that's been perpetrated against millions. But when people don't sit down and think about things like 'do I need this degree for $60k?'

3: in my own state is vote for, shifting all grant funding into programs that show a high likelihood of its graduates attaining a private sector job in a related field. Everyone else, loans that you can declare bankruptcy on.

Also I'd expand a scholarship program supported by private investment portfolios, so it actually grows over time. It can be co managed by multiple local banks in conjunction with the university.
