3niovu,Would Cities Be So Liberal If They Were States?,18,GodOfTime,"Most cities in the United States seem to be pretty liberal. New York, Chicago, LA, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and most other major cities lean pretty far to the left. 

Something else they seem to have in common is that they don't tend to identify with the state they're in. As a Chicagoan, I don't identify as an Illinoisan, but I have a lot of pride in my city, and I've seen the same of people in other cities with their states.

Conservatism tends to revolve around the idea of states rights. Places where state-pride is pretty big, like Texas, are all for states rights. Big cities though? Not so much.

I'm thinking that state pride is linked to supporting states rights, and as a result, conservatism. If cities were recognized as their own states, city livers who already take pride in their cities would suddenly be taking pride in their state. City dwellers would then have the same  kind of desire to maintain the sovereignty of their states that other people already have for their states.

Following this chain of logic, if cities were to become their own states, they wouldn't be as liberal as they currently tend to be.

Edit: When I say more ""conservative,"" I don't mean more conservative in terms of spending or social issues like gay marriage. I merely meant liberal in terms of the size of the federal government. And also, I wasn't advocating for the idea of state's rights, was just thinking about possible connections between pride in one's own state and opposition the federal government.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3niovu/would_cities_be_so_liberal_if_they_were_states/,PoliticalDiscussion,1444007156,1444718628
