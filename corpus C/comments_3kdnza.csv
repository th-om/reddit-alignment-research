First of all, what period of time are we living in again? I know that for a long time outsiders were considered less than human by the people on the ""inside"" of some groups. A great example is how Indians were seen as below the colonizing Europeans, which made it fine to steal their land and kill them and whatever else. More recently the nazis obviously had a similar views about a number of groups. In the year 2015 though I would hope we would realize that just because someone with a syrian passport is suffering that doesnt make it more ok than someone with an American passport. Obama's foreign policy is not fine just because other peoples are being killed. Those people are just as worthwhile as any other random american. Yes obama needs to focus on Americans, but he can not be President in 2015 with only the goal of ""well, lets try to keep the killing away from Americans"" Its frankly barbaric. Its a global community now and concern must always be given to the welfare of that community. 

If such silly things as life or death still don't bother you though, theres a more realpolitik argument to why this thinking is bad.

I don't necessarily buy that argument completely, but I definitely think its a valid one with some basis is facts.

cuwwcts,1,t3_3kdnza,thatnameagain,"> Given that the documents redact who exactly was shipping the weapons to Syria, do you see a potential for another Iran-Contra type situation?

No, republicans have criticized Obama for not supporting the rebels enough, so if it turns out that this was the CIA sending them weapons I don't see how they could say they opposed it. Democrats aren't particularly vocal about opposition to the U.S.'s actions in Syria either so I don't see who could credibly shame the administration for doing this.

The worst thing I think these documents reveal the extent to which the CIA can overrule the presidency on foreign issues. It's been established by numerous Republican investigations into the issue that it was the CIA who provided the incorrect information to the administration in press talking points. The common implication seems to be that this was them trying to keep their presence there under wraps, and these documents would seem to confirm that, and that the Obama administration went along with them for the sake of what they perceived to be national security. So again, it seems like the extent of the scandal here is that the CIA wanted to keep it's intel and operations secret and the Obama administration refused to throw them under the bus by revealing the truth about the attack (which wouldn't have made a difference on anything). So again it seems like confirmation of what we already knew, and undercuts the view that there was anything nefarious going on other than a CIA-led operation to support Syrian rebels. Unless the Republicans are going to turn anti-CIA all of a sudden, I'm not sure how this fits with their narrative.

I'm not really sure how you can say that given the amount of training, money and equipment we were giving to Iraq at the time, which of course was done with the goal of trying to keep their shaky government stable. If that's ""nothing"" then it's certainly a whole lot of nothing.

Being an incredibly corrupt government despite a decade of U.S. efforts to get them to clean up their mess, Iraq unsurprisingly squandered the help we provided.

Some people might say that the Obama administration could have just ""done something"" to make that reality disappear and make everything permanently invincible in Iraq, which always leaves me scratching my head as to what they mean. 

But hey, I'm not opposed to saying that Obama tried to do something here and it didn't work. U.S. policy oftentimes fails to achieve it's goals, but in this case I'm not seeing it as unconcernedness of incompetence. The two alternatives where either doing nothing / pulling back, or sending in significant military forces simultaneously to Iraq, Libya and Syria. It's anyone's guess what would have happened in either case, but as far as putting in more troops I think it's safe to say that we had no reasons whatsoever to think that it would have been any more successful, given the results of literally everywhere else we've made firm military commitments against Islamic insurgencies. There's not some no-brainer policy decision being revealed here. If anything it shows the uncertainty and complexity of the situation.

> The Republicans were divided nearly in half on the issue of providing weapons to the rebels.

This is true enough, but we all know which side was the more vocal and more ready to try and hold Obama's feet to the fire. Honestly I don't trust most Republicans this side of Rand Paul when they put on their non-interventionist hats; to me it usually seems like a position of convenience taken just to oppose Obama. Meanwhile the pro-war Republicans were dusting off the old ""Obama is weak"" one-liners. The standard line from the Right nowadays is that Obama should have taken more, not less, military action in Syria earlier.

cuxbjxp,0,t1_cux8hwe,thatnameagain,"> But didn't Petraeus' ""surge"" work? Wasn't there a significant decrease in sectarian violence as well as violence against US and Iraqi troops after we made the serious commitment?

It worked to a certain extent, though the decrease in Sectarian violence owed a lot too the fact that the Shias consolidated their political hold on Baghdad by that point, and communities had re-sorted to be more segregated. Additionally the Anbar awakening, which was temporary, was as big a factor as the surge (if not bigger) in pushing AQI back in Northern Iraq. And after all that, the violence level was still quite high. 

Violence in increased in Iraq again once there was spillover from the Syrian Civil war, so, leaving aside the status of forces agreement, if we had kept more troops in Iraq longer then the difference would be that U.S. troops would once again be doing major fighting like the height of the Iraq insurgency again, only now against ISIS. Our casualties in Iraq would mount, and ISIS would have a safe haven in Syria like today, so then we would have to debate bombing or invading Syria like Cambodia in the Vietnam war. So then we're either invading and going up against Russian-backed Syrian troops as well as ISIS, or basically doing what we're doing now by bombing them in Syria, except that we'd be taking casualties in Iraq as well, essentially anchoring us in a sand trap.

Best case scenario is that we would then be occupying all of Syria and trying to keep the peace in Iraq again, basically back to where we were in 2004 only with more territory to have to police. 

> Seems like that all fell apart when Obama was elected. 

>It absolutely amazes me that we could help rebuild Germany and Japan into world powers yet we are powerless to have any effect on what essentially are third world countries.

That's because Germans and Japanese weren't forming well-funded militias to try and constantly kill Americans and fellow countrymen after the invasion was complete. German and Japanese society wasn't broken before we got there, Iraq's certainly was.
