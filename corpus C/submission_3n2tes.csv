3n2tes,Could the email controversy blow up in the GOP's face?,287,Aumah,"An increasing amount of talk about this: the Benghazi committee being a witch hunt. If that narrative starts to take hold it would be a real boon to Hillary, and make the GOP look *REALLY* bad. Hillary becomes the victim; the GOP becomes the guys who used dead Americans as political cover so they could dig up dirt.

Could the Benghazi committee become a victim of its own success? Did they overplay their hand?
