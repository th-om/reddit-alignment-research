Land, a home, a car, food, and enough money to quit working and retire on for thirty years while sending their kids to college is not nothing.

>those who sit on housing and buildings and make others pay them for eh ability to use them, essentially over-capturing the past paid-off risks are taking from everyone else. As inequity gets larger, the leverage those in class 3 have over everyone else in class 2 and the quickly growing class 1 continues to expand.

I am almost positive that the concept of 'rent' has existed ever since there has been money, possibly even before that.

>dramatically increased transparency of money, moving toward no private money

Because we'd all like to go back to bartering and trading pigs and chickens for services??

Because this has been shown to work *quite* well in the past.

This is basically the conclusion of Marxism and this line of philosophy has being around for 150 years

>>death sentences for corporate entities no longer serving the needs of the population

Who defines what the ""needs of the population is?"" Is Apple and the iphone ""serving the needs of the population"" or does it need to be eliminated?

>>Elimination of public debt, entirely - no governance without funds raised for purpose

In reality though you are just eliminating flexibility of government budgets and probably fucking over poor people who are on welfare in the process.

Public debt is one of the great innovations of the last 300 years or so and one of the things which allows the modern state to function.

>>Elimination of laws as the primary means of governing, in favor of a mix of laws for forbidden behaviors and a set of norms and principles that are group enforced as part of society

This isn't all that different from how things are ran today actually

>elimination of remote ownership in a variety of contexts, essentially eliminating absentee landlords and stock ownership

So who owns companies then? The Marxist answer is 'the workers"" so I'm kinda wondering if you are also getting this part from them too.

I mean you are pretty much just reiterating the conclusions of Marxism and the slogans of Socialist parties of the early 20th century",1,0,1443056886,1444724828
cvc2jjx,0,t1_cvc249p,jmdugan,"> ""needs of the population is?""

this is threaded together with the challenges with extremely simple models for property.  there's no simple answer defined in the norms of current culture.  essentially the state now enables and encourages groupings of people to conduct trade, but it's an advantage, and the role of any state, the one most powerful group in the civilization needs to be the betterment of all the people, not just the owners.  somewhere between when the king of england stated handing out favors to make the first companies and now (probably near to the santa clara decision) we lost the whole point of companies.

interesting take on it.  I see fundamental differences, clearly have not expressed them well.  do not see Marxism as the solutions to the world's problems.

> one of the things which allows the modern state to function

reason enough to see the need to eliminate it.  make consent real and then start taking money ""we all"" owe to someone holding sovereign debt.

Why not?

I get it that everybody ""understands"" that Marxism doesn't work, but you are pretty much repeating Marxist talking points without realizing it.

>choosing to take resources, and make others pay for the rights to rent and use those resources to help other growth occur. Why?

Because the world doesn't run on the honor system and never will? Ever hear about all the people renting through AirBnB that trash people's houses? Imagine a world where there are fewer repercussions for doing that.
