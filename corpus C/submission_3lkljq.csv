3lkljq,Will it ever be possible to elect politicians based on merit rather than popularity?,27,safety_jam,"As Churchill said, ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried."" 

Do you think that a system based on merit could ever be reasonable? For example, there could be a national round of nominations where every can cast a vote for a leader they support. Then the top x # of candidates could be chosen and then tested on intelligence, empathy, economics, military strategy, problem solving skills, etc., and the best candidates would be chosen to serve terms in government. 

Could such a system ever be implemented in our societies?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lkljq/will_it_ever_be_possible_to_elect_politicians/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442679875,1444726520
