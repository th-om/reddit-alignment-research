At some point the man made comments that were deemed racist, something to the liking of ""I almost wonder if blacks were better under (slavery or segregation, I forget)."" He was talking about how modern blacks are subject to much cultural decay - broken families, fatherless households, etc. I also believe he used the term ""negro/s"" (he was an old dude). This obviously caused a huge shitstorm with people calling him a racist, because his way of making an analogy to how bad blacks have it now was rather extreme.

However he then went on to say, paraphrasing, that it was disgusting and abhorrent how blacks abort their children more than any other group.

It would be costly, yes. But my point is that it's not impractical. We absolutely have the means to do it - and to do it humanely - at our immediate disposal.

>Not to mention the fact that most ""native citizens"" don't want to work menial agricultural jobs in places like California where nearly 10% of the state's workforce is undocumented.

Most urban liberals don't want to work agricultural jobs where they might have to exert their frail bodies and potentially even sweat in the hot sun, but there are plenty of unemployed men in the South whose families have worked on farms for generations and who would be happy to work an agricultural job themselves if there were any available and paying a decent wage.

No, the real problem here is the owners who want to pay a slave wage to illegal workers, and whose profit margins will be wrecked by having to pay the minimum wage to legal workers. The economic effect of this would probably be severe, I imagine. Perhaps the cost of food would increase; I imagine that might be likely.

>Amnesty, on the other hand, would provide huge economic benefits in the form of raised wages for all workers, new jobs created, and additional tax revenue generated.

Raised wages? For the foreign workers who are currently payed a slave wage, maybe. But that'll cut into profit margins just the same as if they were deported and replaced with native workers.

New jobs created? That's simply ridiculous and can be disproved using basic arithmetic. These illegal immigrants aren't job creators, they're job occupants.

Additional tax revenue? Yeah, that's true. Can't argue with that. Probably wouldn't be a huge increase, but it would be an increase. The problem is that I don't care.

>Nice try, but you really don't seem to be very informed on this matter...

I'm as informed as you are. You seem to think I care about what establishment, business ""conservatives"" want; or that I care primarily about profit margins and government revenue; or that I think mass deportation would be easy. I think none of these things. Establishment, business ""conservatives"" can drop dead, profit margins and government revenue can be dealt with as necessary, and mass deportation will not be easy but it is *necessary*.

Above that, what are we going to do? This would create 11 million new criminals in the system where at 2.2 million people incarcerated, its already considered over-capacity. You can't keep them in prisons. We'd have to round them up into camps. 

Its not like theyre going to be deported right away. They'd likley have to wait around for one reason or another, so there would be entire families in camps for long periods of time.

After this, what is the guarantee that countries like Mexico are going to *accept* millions of new people over the course of 2 years? The would actually be disastrous for smaller countires in Central America with weaker economies, how are they supposed to provide for those new people?

This would be a human rights catastrophe. Millions of people arrested for a **nonviolent crime** (which there's already a movement to decriminalize drugs like marijuana because of that) rounded up most likely based on their ethnicity, sent to camps to await deportation, and *IF* these counties accept that many new people over the course of 2 years, they may very well have no way to provide for them.

At the risk of invoking Godwins law, even after Nazi Germany started discriminating against Jews, out of 522,000 living there in 1933, 214,000 stayed behind by the start of WW2.

Okay, lets talk for a second. Mexico is one of the our greatest allies in the region. it absolutely matters how it handles it. Our relations with other countries in our own hemisphere matters greatly.

And the fact that this would massively hurt smaller countries economies as well as the *people we deport* matters as well.

Even *if* considerably more people left on their own than actually would, you would still need camps. Like I said in my previous comment, at 2.2 million prisoners, our prison system is considered over capacity and has problems treating prisoners humanely.

Immigration is one of those cases where I may not agree with him, but I don't see anything ""wrong"" with his position.

If immigration is generally a bad thing, then we *should* crack down on immigration laws. But if our immigration laws are messed up and punish people for just living their life and harming nobody, then it's weird to make cracking down on immigration a top priority. For instance, even though pot is legalized in Colorado, it's still against federal law. Even though, in general, the law should be followed and enforced, what would you think about a candidate who prioritized taking extreme measures to punish any person who smoked pot in Colorado?

I think our drug laws are bad, but our immigration laws are even worse. Imagine that it was, by default, illegal for a white person to hire a black person or sell/rent property to them. It was only allowed after a black person went through a long, uncertain process to get a license approving them for hire by white people. Clearly many people would break this law. And politicians who were primarily interested in stepping up enforcement of this law would, in my opinion, be evil racists.
