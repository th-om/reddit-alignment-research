Now imagine what would happened if they tried to ""deal"" with Pakistan - civil war perhaps, a Taliban style take over?  Pakistan is a massive country with 180 million people the US neither has the manpower nor the political will to invade and any forced government change would likely make things worse.

I mean seriously what do you imagine happening?  I'm sure you are naive and young but you seems to know the sum total of F all about the country you are proposing ""dealing with""",1,0,1442171823,1444729352

This is the problem.  Idiots not understanding the point of war.  You don't just go in and destabilize countries.   All it does is make money for the defense industry and lower regional and possibly global security.",0,0,1442219711,1444729356
