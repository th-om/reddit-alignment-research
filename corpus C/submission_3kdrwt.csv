3kdrwt,"Being intolerant of intolerance, an issue the left needs to figure out.",311,slam7211,"Unless you have been living under a rock you know about the Kim Davis issue, and the small but growing tide of people using civil disobedience to defy the SCOTUS ruling on gay marriage. A lot of people on reddit (myself included) think these people are wrong, intolerant, and on the wrong side of history. The problem here can be summarized by a 2 step philosophy from the left.

1) be tolerant of people and lifestyles that do not harm others.

2) except people who do not believe in 1), fuck those people.

The problem with this ideology beyond its obvious hypocracy is that a lot of people on the left, especially on reddit, do not think of offending religious beliefs as harm. ""After all it is just BS hocus pocus that people should just move beyond right?""

Obviously the fact that Kim Davis is a government employee makes this a little more cut and dry, but in a broader perspective I feel like the clash between the pseudo tolerant left and the ""backwards"" (from the left perspective) social conservatives will grow as the left pushes the boundaries of what needs to be tolerated (more protections for gays, specifically trans people will cause a whole 'nother crisis mark my words). Is there some kind of middle ground here that the left and right could meet on, or is this going to be the issue of our generation where the federal government consistently overturns state laws and ""infringes"" on their sovereignty causing perpetual conservative backlash?  

To what extent should people be tolerant of intolerance and bigotry in this country?",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kdrwt/being_intolerant_of_intolerance_an_issue_the_left/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441882818,1444730468
