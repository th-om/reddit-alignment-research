Boehner is the former. The latter do not like him and have attempted to undermine his own plans for things. His job has been to try and corral these members into supporting his plans. They've scuttled plans, threatened backbencher revolts, and generally been difficult. His job is not made easier with the fact that American parties are quite weak, and IIRC they've attempted to eliminate pork spending which is a lovely way of getting members on board. 

With another shutdown fight looming he's resigning in an attempt to try and avert it. And, given he's resigning his seat to, I'd guess he may just be tired and exhausted of the fight. ",13,0,1443214384,1444723673

cveim8t,0,t1_cvei3a2,Lews-Therin-Telamon,"Lol, I was never arguing that Boehner telling the Tea Party to go fuck itself would hurt his employment potential. I'm sure it would be just fine for him.

I was saying that there are few issues where you can credibly call the Republican party not 'the party of big business', which would by association make the Democratic party 'the party of big business' on that issue. 

Here we are several comments later, and you have edited in one issue that you think is a good example despite snarling that there is an incredibly diverse and obvious stockpile of these issues where the Republican establishment sides with against big business (and by extension the Democrats are 'the party of big business' on that issue).",1,0,1443240237,1444723676
cve780c,1,t3_3mdovu,AMatterofTrust,"The speaker of the house is simply the leader of the house of representatives. He decides committee placements, brings bills to the floor, and controls legislative activity, (when x is debated, how long, when is it voted on). The republican congress has two factions in the GOP party. Moderate republicans, who once made the entirely of the GOP, and Tea Party Members. Tea party members do not have a majority in congress, however, they are a pain in the neck for Boehner. 

The speaker is the leader of the party he belongs to. After all, he sets the agenda, puts bills to the floor, and he obviously does so in a way to pass bills suiting his, and his parties, agenda. However, with the rise of the Tea Party, that has become hard. For example, most republicans, including Boehner, and all the democrats, want to pass the export-import bank. However, a minority but significant number of conservatives do not. He needs to keep the party together. 

There are 435 members of congress. Half belong to one party, but they are all different people, they all have their own agenda. And a house position has less standing than a senator, the people in the house are good at writing legislation, but nobody is an expert on everything. Most don't know what these bills mean (some of them, some they understand) they only know what experts are saying, what party leaders are saying, and what their constituency wants. So people like Boehner, Paul Ryan, ect. are critical in uniting them in support for a bill. There is no purpose in a majority if the party cannot vote together. Boehner job as leader of his party is to ensure that his party falls in line. People like Paul Ryan decide what the house is going to do in terms of the economy. Setting the agenda, what is the party going to talk about, what are they going to focus on, and what their exact position is (more than a yes/no as members of the house do, but actual nuanced viewpoints, is what Bohener, Ryan, and others are responsible for. 

Another important point. Boehner must compromise. If he brings a bill that does not fit with the republican agenda exactly, he must convince his members to fall in line. That is the essence of compromise. **No one** can reliably expect over 230 members of congress to vote ""yes"" on a bill they disagree with, but is necessary to further compromise. Unless however, someone is prodding them along. Boehner convinces his fellow party members on were to stand for their ideals and where to betray them, as does Pelosi, so a bill can pass all areas of government. Here is an example. For the TPP, congress must pass fast track. However, senate democrats will not give up their filibuster unless they had the TAA, trade adjustment assistance. Republicans do not support the TAA, but passing it was necessary to further republican agenda. And thus, Boehner is tasked with not only creating this deal, but convincing his party to vote yes to TAA, even though they disagree, because it best furthers their interests.

Parties are broad tents. They have differing viewpoints among them. Recently, the tea party gained a sizable portion on the house. While Boehner can pursue his legislation without them, they have combined into a group, a solid group, willing to set its own agenda. In essence, they want to decide what to talk about, they decide what to debate, what bills to bring to the floor. Boehner initially ignored them. 

However, he needed them. Trade or instance. Many ea party members come from manufacturing districts, while they agree that free trade is good, their constituency does not. 

However, it is more than just issues. Their is agreement, after all, between the tea party and moderates, it is why the tea party is republican. **However, their idea of the process to go about their views is radically different than Boehner.** Boehner has compromised. Tea Party members don't like compromise. So when Boehner says they are going to vote on a resolution for disapproval for the Iran deal, the tea party wants them to vote for a resolution of approval, and let it fail. 

What the tea party does not understand is that this sort of deal-making is necessary to pursue your interests. That convincing your party to vote no on a bill they agree with or the opposite is part of compromise. Instead the tea party seeks more radical solutions, shut down the government, they already did it once against Boehner's interests, and now they want to do it again. Boehner has lost control of his party, so he is resigning. 

The tea party does not want to sacrifice the ideals the Bohener is sacrificing for in his opinion the betterment of the country. 

So there is differences on positions, but more than that there is difference on how to pursue a set of common interests. Boehner has compromised his way, in that is convincing your party to rally around their leader and vote with their leader, compromising their ideals when necessary, to pursue their interests. Democrats do this as well, but obviously the democrats are not in power. Because nobody has the white house and both houses of congress, compromise is essential. However, the tea party has sought to use radical measures instead to pursue their interests. 

Note this is not unique to the the republicans. The progressive coalition does act like the tea party as well, but the progressive coalition is pretty much irrelevant, they do not have enough seats (so Bernie Sanders disagrees with how his party sacrifices ideals to pursue their aims. He does ... what?) However, the tea party is in power, so we are where we are today. ",7,0,1443216733,1444723676

I'd argue that he is a more moderate politician, but he has to be careful, because a vocal part of the GOP is much more extreme. However, he needs their support to pursue his own, more moderate agenda. This makes compromising with Democrats or his own standards difficult. This makes the job taxing--you have to be a compromiser, while not compromising the principles of the far right. Compromise is absolutely necessary for a functioning government.

Recently, there has been issues over Planned Parenthood, and Boehner is unwilling to go through another shutdown over this--others are willing to. In addition, Boehner lacks enough GOP votes for re-election, and would need Democratic votes.",6,0,1443214128,1444723676

Boehner was just a sensible guy compared to the illogical Tea Party. The idea that you could repeal Obamacare, the 4 year President's biggest effort which took a year to pass, because the GOP won a midterm with less than half of the population voting is an absurdity.
