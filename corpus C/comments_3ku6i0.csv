#3 Identification of enemies/ scapegoats The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our ""leaders"" can't say no!

Sexism: [""A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously.""](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/29/410606045/the-bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-explained)

More sexism: [""Sexual adjustment seemed to be very poor in those with cancer of the cervix.""](http://www.mediaite.com/online/bernie-sanders-once-blamed-cervical-cancer-on-a-lack-of-orgasms/)

Corporate power is protected: [Bernie's firmly in bed with the sugar industry's lobbyists.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredmeyer/2015/08/25/sanders-rubio-support-costly-sugar-subsidies/)

Nationalism: [Bernie bellows that he remembers a time when you could walk into a department store and ""buy things made in the U.S.A.""](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421369/bernie-sanders-national-socialism)

Scapegoating: This is just too easy.  He can't go two sentences without blaming something on the rich, the 1%, or the oligarchy.

Militarism/National Security: [He (Bernie) sends out mailings to veterans that supports the US having ""the strongest military in the world,"" while praising our sacrifices as veterans ""for the freedom of Americans.""](http://www.libertyunionparty.org/?page_id=363)

Disdain for Human Rights: [Bernie thinks you can delegate rights you don't have.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBIKP4W50-I)

Your second to last link was about the gulf war. A war my father fought in and was one of the few truly just wars we have ever engaged in. Iraq invaded another country, which incidentally is what Trump wants to do to Iraq right now. His idea of how to handle ISIS is to capture Iraq's oil fields and create military bases around them. This would not only condemn those soldiers to being massacred. It would also violate Iraqs national sovereignty by waging an aggressive war against them for our national economic gain. I mean I am pretty sure that a previous historical figure made it a practice to wage aggressive wars, and that ended fine for him right?

Onto the corporate power is protected I hardly think that 20,000 in the last 2 election cycles is in bed with. Also we are talking about the farm bill here which has a vast impact on American society. This is not just about the sugar lobby. 

As for your first article if you had bothered to read the full thing you might just might have caught on that this was supposed to be dark satire from 43 years ago. What has the Sanders campaign said?
The Sanders campaign quickly tried to distance itself — and the candidate — from the 43-year-old essay. Campaign spokesman Michael Briggs called the essay a ""dumb attempt at dark satire in an alternative publication"" in an interview with CNN, adding that it ""in no way reflects his views or record on women."" He added, ""It was intended to attack gender stereotypes of the '70s, but it looks as stupid today as it was then.""

Trump on the other hand often makes blatantly sexist/ racist remarks that are just out of left field. 

Trump also has risen to power by deceiving his investors time and time again. How can you trust this person politically, when it has been his life's work to lie and cheat his way to the top.

As for your Scapegoating b.s. the fact is we are becoming a plutocracy. Especially after citizens united. So who is to blame for the rich having a disproportionate control over this country's politics. I suppose you could do the typical knee jerk right thing, and blame the poor. I mean after all if they just had the strength they could have been rich too. The ironic thing is you probably will not see what is wrong with that statement. The truly ironic thing is it is that level of out of touchness that makes the poor really hate the rich. It always reminds me of that douchebag who said let them eat cake, and was summarily truly surprised when the executioners axe came down on her head.

cv1jup2,0,t1_cv11nfp,ThisisClambake,All that effort you just put in to defending Bernie's remarks - and I'm not saying you are wrong for doing so by the way - but all that effort could be used to justify the same things you pointed out for Trump. Especially the sexism stuff. You just like Bernie and you don't like Trump. No need to try to turn him into the devil.,2,0,1442263276,1444729326
