3kjbfk,I'm a bit surprised we're not hearing more talk about Bernie Sanders advanced age,93,The_Juggler17,"Just a thought - I've heard very little criticism of Sanders for being so elderly. Seems like something that would be talked about a little more. 

Sure I'm a Sanders supporter too, but this guy is 74. If elected, what kind of health problems might he have? Is he even going to live 4 more years? Morbid to think about, but it's a consideration to be made - puts a lot of pressure on his choice of a running mate. 

. 

I just remember this was a big deal when John McCain was running against Obama. A lot of critics brought up how old he is, and said we're potentially electing his vice president (Sarah Palin) because it's a strong possibility that he'll die in office or have very bad health. 

So I'm surprised we're not seeing similar attacks from the right against Sanders. ",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kjbfk/im_a_bit_surprised_were_not_hearing_more_talk/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441975655,1444730082
