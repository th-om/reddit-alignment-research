cv06soe,1,t3_3ksyxv,Enturk,"I fear you'll get different answers based on what commenters think is ""balanced"" or not biased. The truth is that we are all biased. Even computers are biased.

Having said that, Dan Carlin is pretty respected, and has a podcast called [Common Sense](http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/). Others that try to stick with facts as much as possible often must fall back to statistical or economic data, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. [Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) and [NPR's Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money) podcast seem to fit those bills. That's all I have off the top of my head.",3,0,1442165680,1444729358
cv0cg98,1,t3_3ksyxv,Swolemageddonfour,It depends what you mean by balanced?  I would argue that there is no such thing there is only what is supported by evidence and what is not.  The sooner we treat government like science better,2,0,1442174011,1444729358
cv1812y,1,t3_3ksyxv,avariciousPUMPKIN,"Vox is probably your best bet.  

Nate Silver's blog is great but it's a lot of things other then the news and politics.  Ezra Klein takes Silver's data driven analysis and applies it to the news and politics in general.  It's far less ""I believe ..."" and more ""data proves ..."". 

ConReps believe it has a liberal slant but it's just the data confirming liberals are correct about things.

It's important to remember being ""balanced"" or non-partisan doesn't mean one party is good and the other bad.  Too many people seem to think unless Sarah Palin has a soapbox it's proof of bias. ",2,0,1442245098,1444729358

The New York Times is pretty centrist IIRC. The National Review is right-leaning, and Salon/Slate and Mother Jones are all left-leaning sites IIRC.

cv0f4xn,1,t3_3ksyxv,prinzplagueorange,"The concepts ""bias"" and ""balance"" are severely confused.  ""Balanced"" is not the same thing as factually accurate.  Almost any major news sources (and many obscure news sources) will do a reasonable job of being factually accurate (of describing ""who did what"" in accordance with physical reality).  The problem is that every news source is also inescapably ""ideological"" (in other words, it imposes order on the events, explaining why they happen and which events are important, i.e. ""newsworthy"").  If ""balanced"" is taken to mean ""both sides of the story,"" the difficulty is that there are a lot more than two ideologies in contemporary society and different ideologies often cannot agree on which events are newsworthy to begin with.  Mainstream journalists try to dodge this problem by defining their job as accurately repeating what the Democrats, Republicans, and various government spokespeople say, but this this itself just produces a mishmash of the Republican and Democratic Parties' ideologies, which, in turn, ultimately just amount to power's side of the story.  My advice is to read either the NY Times or the Washington Post because they are the two major American news outlets that everyone else (journalists included) take seriously (though, as a Marxist I will tell you that they are both biased as hell in favor of the capitalist class and the U.S. military).  Then figure out what your political convictions are (what you think a just world would look like) and try to find some politically committed news outlets that honestly and thoughtfully engage with those issues.",1,0,1442177937,1444729358
cv0n1nx,1,t3_3ksyxv,FLSun,"Unfortunately it's hard to find a News source that is truly unbiased. What I did is set my homepage to www.news.google.com Sign in and set as your homepage. Then when you see a story that you would like to learn more about you click on 2 or 3 different sources. For example, say there is a story about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. You click on a link like Al Jazeera and  link from an Israeli news source and perhaps a link like the BBC or one from Australia. This way you get more than one side of the story and you are able to decide for yourself. 

You can personalize the page to have more of the topics you want to see such as Politics and less of the stuff you don't want to see, like Entertainment. You can also minimize sources that are not reputable, like Fox News. ",1,0,1442191684,1444729358
