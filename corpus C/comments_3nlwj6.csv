> One way to read the essay is that Sanders was doing (in a supremely ham-handed way) what journalists do every day: draw the reader in with an attention-getting lede, then get to the meat of the article in the middle.

And from the right-wing National Review's Charles Cooke (emphasis mine):

> Nobody honestly believes that Bernie Sanders is a sexual pervert or that he is a misogynist or that he intends to do women any harm. Nobody suspects that he harbors a secret desire to pass intrusive legislation or to cut gang rapists a break. **Really, there is only one reason that anyone would make hay of this story, and that is to damage the man politically.** Perhaps I’m old-fashioned. Perhaps I’m hopelessly idealistic. But until I see any sign of actual wrongdoing I’d much prefer to slam Sanders for his dangerous and ridiculous politics than to delve back into his past and embarrass him with a long-forgotten opinion. I certainly hope that my fellow conservatives will feel the same way, even if they do not enjoy the same courtesy from their adversaries.",7,0,1444072005,1444717167
cvpink7,1,t3_3nlwj6,Mrs_Frisby,"You should be more worried that he is a firm believer in, and champion of, alternative medicine and is scared of nuclear power.  

As in, when everyone else was trying to get the ACA passed [he was trying to get amendments to it to make insurers cover yoga and acupuncture (see section 5)](http://theintegratorblog.com/?option=com_content&task=view&id=658&Itemid=189).  He was a key player in [getting ""naturopaths"" licensed to practice medicine unsupervised in Vermont](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/legislative-alchemy-revisited-naturopathy-in-vermont-and-colloidal-silver/) ... these are people who believe that injecting people with colloidal silver cures cancer etc and Bernie thinks they should be empowered to write prescriptions.  He's so enthusiastic about it he [spends time on the Hill telling his coworkers how great they are](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/sanders-remarks-on-complementary-and-alternative-health-care) and Alternative medicine advocates love him while [science based publications oppose his stances](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/integrative-medicine-invades-the-u-s-military-part-one/).  Remember that sham of a congressional hearing where a bunch of priests testified about whether women need access to birth control but Sandra Fluke was denied entrance?  Bernie orchestrated something similar with a panel full of chiropractors but no actual doctors.  

He's a flake.  A nice flake.  A caring flake.  A good person.  But still a flake and fundamentally anti-science.  Anti-science isn't shorthand for climate denier.  It just means someone who says science is great when science agrees with them and is wrong when it disagrees with them.  So he is a medical science denier.  One of my aunt's is the same way, esp with anti-vax and wishful thinking medicine.  I love her dearly but I wouldn't put her in charge of the country.  They both have short attention spans and poor abilities to prioritize.  

Also he did a full 180 from ""lets have no gun restriction at all!"" to ""Lets ban all guns outside of hunting rifles!"" **managing to simultaneously piss off both the pro and anti-gun lobbies**.  The anti's don't believe his new rhetoric after 25 years of doing stupid shit like voting to allow guns on amtrak and voting against even the most basic background checks and the 2A-4-Lyfe folks are flipping their shit at his shiny new ""GUNS BAD!  RAWR!!!"" rhetoric while simultaneously disproving the claim that he is a ""different"" kind of politician that doesn't pander but rather bases his positions on internal principles.  

And if that isn't enough coffin nails for you he also has a history of being a jackass about immigration and voting against immigration bills that hispanic leaders supported on the stated grounds that the immigrants are taking away jobs that are rightfully american jobs.  Also after ferguson *[in a video he is still hosting on his own website](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/video-audio/ferguson)* he stated that he didn't think giving the police all these military toys was the problem, and that if the kids in ferguson had jobs they wouldn't be so criminal that the police were so afraid of them that ferguson happened.  Note:  Ferguson did not have high unemployment or high crime.  What it had was a white police force terrorizing a black populace.  Black and hispanic voters are base democrat voters and shitting on their problems is a bad, bad move.  Both morally and politically.  

He's like Sarah Palin in that he has never in his life been vetted, he got a lot of promotion out of nowhere, a lot of people are projecting what they want him to be onto him, and the image is falling apart because in the big leagues you get put under a magnifying glass and if you have crazy shit to dig up, it will be dug up.  And he's got *lots* of crazy shit to dig up.  Reddit is currently sticking its fingers in its ears going ""LALALALALA"" whenever this is pointed out but its true.
