cv4tvm5,1,t3_3lbdcu,ThreeCranes,I think the issue is that Walker is dropping in the polls (because he has no charisma) and they're giving him less time because of that.,3,0,1442507597,1444727416

cv4vi8a,0,t1_cv4u1gk,cjdeck1,"Debate lasted for close to 3 hours.

If each person were granted equal time, Walker ought to have had close to double the amount of time granted.

Of course, CNN wants to put more of that time on the front runners  (notably Trump)",2,0,1442510054,1444727416

cv4vgij,1,t3_3lbdcu,CrapNeck5000,"It seemed clear to me that CNN was content to let any candidate jump in at almost any time on any topic they wanted.  Plenty of people chimed in on questions that weren't asked of them and in instances where their names weren't brought up.  

So I would blame Walker for that.  ",1,0,1442509985,1444727420

So he was the candidate with the least time, but I wouldn't blame CNN.  The candidates were fighting for air time, and Walker just didn't fight hard enough. I'm just thinking about how they all just kept talking, even when the moderator or other candidates tried to interrupt them. ",1,0,1442512475,1444727420
cv4xyku,0,t1_cv4x4ru,garfangle,"There was a long stretch in the middle 2nd hour where Walker wasn't called upon either directly or in reference by another candidate so I'm sure Walker wanted to get in, but he didn't want to shout over the other candidates and thus look foolish.
