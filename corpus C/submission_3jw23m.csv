3jw23m,How long should Kim Davis stay in Jail?,21,robert9712000," Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with her decision, there is another issue that i think needs addressed.

From what i read Bunning ordered her to go to jail for disobedience of the law and that she is to remain there until she agrees to issue the marriage license. I understand that she can only be removed by impeachment and with a conservative Kentucky legislature that seems unlikely.

 For now the length is in her hands. If she refuses to comply however should there be a limit to her incarceration or is there a scenario where she could spend life in prison for taking a stand for her religious convictions?

 I understand separation of church and state but any extended jail sentence for deciding to practice your religious convictions seems to go against one of the core reasons our country was founded.
