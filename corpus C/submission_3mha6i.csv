3mha6i,Newt Gingrich for Speaker,25,danhOIUY,"I'd like to put out the idea of bringing Newt Gingrich back for Speaker of the House. Note that there is no requirement for the Speaker to be a former or current Representative... so he's technically eligible.

His qualifications? He's done it before and he actually got stuff done with a Democrat President (who in the end claimed the achievement for the stuff Gignrich's Congress pushed).

His style in some respects overlaps with Trump's. Commanding. Direct. Forceful. Clearly the best GOP debater back in 2011/2012:

I wouldn't be surprised if Trump prepared for his campaign by watching Youtube clips of Newt from that time.

He's actually much more polished than Trump: makes brilliant, coherent points, backed with facts. Really hard to argue with him logically.

Newt actually had significant backing in the primary before Rove/Romney's/media (i.e. WS establishment) forces piled on him while the majority GOP primary electorate was scrambling to look for its anti-Romney candidate. There is some level of appeal and trust from conservative voters; not enough to put him into the Oval Office but enough to represent them in Government.

He's somehow managed to have one foot in the establishment and one foot in the rank and file section and I think he can successfully navigate the wants of the voters and the realities of the Washington politics.

I know many will cite some flip-flopping on some pretty big items as why you can't trust him as a conservative. AGW, universal health care, etc. I'm willing to forgive playing with technocrat ideas because in the end he's one of the few politicians that understands and can articulate individual and state sovereignty.

His ""open marriage"" revelation? Does anyone really care? Actually now that it's out in the open does that not make him less susceptible to blackmail? Who knows what they had on Boehner. (Hastert?)

I'm open to hearing arguments for and against Newt for Speaker. I probably won't respond if it's simply bashing him on the basis that he's a Republican.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mha6i/newt_gingrich_for_speaker/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443285156,1444723388
