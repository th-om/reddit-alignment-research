Great!   Now you realize that the only reason you dislike GMO's is because of your *opinion*, not the facts.

This is why the FDA should handle labeling, not the states.   The FDA deals in facts, not feelings or opinions.   Your claim about 'questionable business practices' would cause a label to appear on Rainbow Papaya, Squash from Syngenta, and non-browning Apples.   You literally assigned labels to those products for no reason other than the fact you dislike a breeding method and an unrelated company.

"" NAFTA supporters frequently tout the benefits of exports while remaining silent on the effects of rapid import growth (Scott 2000). Former President George H.W. Bush, whose administration negotiated NAFTA, recently claimed that “two million NAFTA-related jobs have been created in the United States since 1993″ (Bush 2002). But any evaluation of the impact of trade on the domestic economy must include the impact of both imports and exports. If the United States exports 1,000 cars to Mexico, many American workers are employed in their production. If, however, the United States imports 1,000 cars from Mexico rather than building them domestically, then a similar number of Americans who would have otherwise been employed in the auto industry will have to find other work.

Another critically important promise made by the promoters of NAFTA was that the United States would benefit because of increased exports to a large and growing consumer market in Mexico. This market, in turn, was to be based on an expansion of the middle class that, it was claimed, would grow rapidly due to the wealth created in Mexico by NAFTA. Thus, most U.S. exports were predicted to be consumer products destined for consumption in Mexico.

In fact, most U.S. exports to Mexico are parts and components that are shipped to Mexico and assembled into final products that are then returned to the United States. The number of products that Mexico assembles and exports—such as refrigerators, TVs, automobiles, and computers—has mushroomed under the NAFTA agreement. Many of these products are produced in the Maquiladora export processing zones in Mexico, where parts enter duty free and are re-exported to the United States in assembled products, with duties paid only on the value added in Mexico. The share of total U.S. exports to Mexico that is represented by Maquiladora imports has risen from 39% of U.S. exports in 1993 to 61% in 2002.2 The number of such plants increased from 2,114 in 1993 to 3,251 in 2002 (INEGI 2003a, 2003b).""",1,0,1442929029,1444725964

cv9y9kv,0,t1_cv9rihk,syncopator,"I think you and I have gotten off on the wrong foot.  Probably my fault.  This is the very first time I have found myself anywhere near this side of the argument, and it ain't easy.  Feel free to browse my post history and you will find me supporting the 2A time and time again.

Let's suspend for a moment the details of what Sanders did and didn't say, and instead share some common ground.  We both agree that gun control won't work, right?  I'll bet we both agree that it won't work because criminals by definition don't give a fuck about the law.

There is a problem.  Denying that will in the long term ensure our rights are taken away.  Maybe it is time we become part of the solution.

I will again bet that we agree the vast majority of gun violence in the US is drug/gang related.  The school/mall/theatre shootings are a different (and much smaller statistically) category all together.  One is socio-economic and the other is a mental health issue.

First, the drug/gang crime problem.  The War on Drugs has failed, and so has locking up a higher percentage of our population than any developed country in the world.  Why?  Because if you are born into a situation where the only people who have any real ""quality of life"" are the ones who use guns to take it from others, that is what you learn to respect.  But, truth be told, while gun violence in this segment of society accounts for probably 75% of the total, nobody gives a fuck because it's in the ghetto.  The only time it counts is when it gets added in to the statistics.

The mental health shootings are the ones that make the headlines, and subsequently trumpet the calls for more laws to make it go away.  Of course in every case, no one can specify what new laws would have prevented anything but there must be something to make us feel better, right?

Our country is getting more urban every day.  That isn't going to change.  At the same time, the pressures of society are getting so weird we are starting to act like rats in overpopulated cages.  That isn't going to change either.  The idea that we can simply stand up and shout ""Second Amendment!"" towards anyone who says ""gun control"" is going to become antiquated by circumstances.  It will work until about two-thirds of the population wants to ban all the guns, and the Second Amendment will simply go away.

The reality is that we need to solve the problems.  You and I agree that the problems aren't guns, the problems are the people using them.

If we end the War on Drugs, we drain the profitability of using guns to defend drug territory.  A lot of people got shot over moonshine about a hundred years ago, but the idea seems ridiculous now.  

If we make mental health care easy to find for people who need it, we might actually stand a chance of stopping people from doing seriously crazy shit.  It's obvious that just making crazy shit (like shooting up movie theaters) illegal doesn't work.

Now back to the man in question.  Sanders is the only candidate who wants to do both these things.  He is the only one who wants to actually solve the problems that you and I agree are at the root causes of the issue.  Hillary sure as fuck doesn't want to.  Her donors won't stand for it.  Trump wants to solve a lot of things, but these two issues definitely aren't among them.  The rest of the field isn't really worth mentioning.

If we don't start coming up with solutions to the problem, we *will* eventually be subject to someone else's solution.  And have no doubt about it, the ""pry it from my cold dead hands"" approach is not going to work.

It's become really popular - especially in more liberal areas - to make GMO foods out to be scarier or worse than they really are by using dubious studies, weak correlations, and bad science to try and tie GMOs to things like cancer and autism - and then to call it 'science'. See [Mamavation](http://www.mamavation.com/) for an example of this. Without even attempting to cite refute every single example, there is no established or accredited study that shows that GMO foods are less healthy, or more harmful, than non-GMO foods. I'm not saying its not possible, either: its just that the proof hasn't come out yet. 

I also don't like Bernie's official stance (and a popular stance taken by advocates of non-GMO foods) that we should add non-GMO labeling to all packaged foods, because its in the best interest of consumers, and its something consumers should know. Why bother adding it, if not for an implicit accusation that there is something about GMO foods that would give you cause not to buy them? Everything that we require food producers include on their labeling is there because of a direct and specific health and safety consideration: things like nutritional value and ingredients have direct and specific health risks. Even in states like mine (WA), where we have added calories counts to restaurant menus, was made because of an established public health concern (battling obesity rates). GMO foods have no such safety or health concern  (none recognized by any federal, state, or local government entity), and until any such organization does publicly cite an official declaration of a health and safety concern about GMO foods, then there is no credible reason to require food producers to add such labeling.

Swap a 3rd time for a 20in barrel and scope setup to hunt groundhogs or coyotes.

Yes, anti-gun people do want to ban all guns. A vast majority of firearms are semi-automatic and automatics are already very heavily restricted (look up the NFA). Besides, they are not going after full autos at all, just semi autos that look like full autos.

>So the AR-15 is something you can have now that would be an assault weapon, right? Do people want AR-15s for self-defense? Doesn't seem like something I'd shoot inside my house at an intruder.

Its actually a perfectly acceptable firearm for home defense, It fires a very small bullet for a rifle (Same size as a .22 LR bullet, just a lot more powder behind it). Its the type of round that when using hollow points, has a good chance to get stuck in a wall and not go through it. People often look at it and think the AR15 is a powerful gun, but its not, in fact the reason its illegal to hunt game like deer in most states is because the 5.56x45 round is too weak to reliably kill a deer without perfect aim. TOO WEAK, granted you can get them chambered in other rounds like .308/7.62x51 which is a full rifle round and perfectly fine to hunt deer with along with just about every bullet that exists on earth as AR15s are lego guns that can take many different uppers, the standard configuration is 5.56x45, and that is a weak bullet for a rifle.

Do tell, I don't hear of many drive by baynoettings.

Funconality, there is nothing on a 'military style' weapon that improves its lethality. Leathality of a firearm comes down to the round it fires and the workings of its action.

One could argue a bolt action rifle chambered in .338 Lapua is much more lethal than a AR15, even if the AR15's magazine is 6 times the size, because of how powerful .338 Lapua is.

sure, the AR15 is a cheap, light weight rifle that shoots a small bullet and has a recoil system that takes most of the 'bite' off the recoil, all while being a lego gun that can literally be made into anything you want, even a .50bmg bolt action rifle. Its not because the fact that the M16 is its sister weapon, its just a (arguably) great rifle design over all (I say arguably, as people will tell us its jamtastic and that AK pattern rifles are better, both I don't necessarily agree with).

No, the difference between a handgun and a rifle being more popular for crime is due to size. You can't easily stuff a AR15 down your pants like you can with a pistol. Concealability trumps accuracy and ammo count for criminal use. Rifles are definitely more deadly as it comes to actual use, they are more accurate and rifle rounds, even the small .223, have more power behind them than a 9mm luger round. It really does just come down to the fact that a 9mm glock can be stuffed in your pants while a AR15 would be hard to do while not sticking out like a sour thumb.


So, what do your people want? If you keep going after 'assault weapons' I will keep calling you fools. If you go after pistols, I won't  call you a fool as that is what criminals use, but I won't go with you eaither because I believe we have the right to defend ourselves, and carrying a pistol goes along with that. If your side keeps advocating for shitty laws that don't even try to stop criminals yet try to stop law abiding people from owning firearms and make it more of a hassle for us (Like the last try to pass universal background checks, the way that law was written would not have effected criminals at all while forcing law abiding people to go to an FFL and pay a $50 background check 'tax' in order to do anything, even just passing a firearm to a friend or family temporarily).

There is a lot of miscommunication between both sides of the debate. The pro-control people misunderstand guns and therefore can't properly articulate their position. The media further exaggerates and distorts the issue.

The AR-15's you can buy at the store are semi-automatic. You pull the trigger, one bullet comes out. You pull it again, you get another bullet. You can't hold down the trigger and spray bullets everywhere. That's what an automatic weapon does. Full-auto weapons are highly regulated already.

I would go so far as to say our current process is fine, the problem won't be fixed with more laws as we have 20,000 in place right now, but the enforcement of laws and prosecuting straw buyers, the 'law abiding' people that criminals get most of their guns from. You can add more and more regulations all day and it won't stop a thug's girlfriend, who has no criminal record and legally is allowed to own a gun, from buying a gun and giving it to her boyfriend.

> I'd even go so far as to say I might be for allowing automatic rifles, as long as sufficient restrictions were in place to prevent them from getting in the wrong hands.

Full autos are legal, there is a lenghty process to get one (AKA the NFA act of 1934) and owning one requires the owner to have a valid tax stamp. The guns have just become so expensive (A M16 rifle costs about $25k) because they stopped the ability to add more to the registry in 1986, something I want to have removed as I am overall OK with the NFA process for full autos. That said SBRs and suppressors should be taken off the NFA completely.

This is correct, which is why people like having lots of ammo on tap. Remember in home defense you are most likely poorly dressed, and what ever is in the gun is all you have.

AR-15s are about the same size as a shotgun, and are easier to handle in close quarters since they can be tucked under your arm and controlled with one hand.

Free Trade:

I think there is a difference between someone who says we should not have free trade, and someone who says they do not like current trade agreements. You phrase it as though Sanders is saying we should not trade with other countries. That is not his position. He appears to be sensitive to issues of human rights, currency manipulation, and the integrity of our trade partners. I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing. He did put legislation years back professing what he would want to see in trade agreements related to human rights, so he isn't just speaking platitudes about what it would take to get him to sign off.

Nuclear Power:
   
I could not find anything specifically on Nuclear Power, other than some statements he made about subsidies for the Nuclear Power industry. It doesn't ""bother"" me, if he is against subsidies to the nuclear power industry. If we are talking about public research into nuclear power techniques, than I'm all for it. If we are talking about public support to public nuclear power plants, I'm for it. If we are talking about specific subsidies to private nuclear power plants, I'm not sure why we do that. This doesn't appear to be a major issue for him.
  
Anti-GMO:
  
I'm not well read enough on GMOs to know all the politics about the industry and its practices. The idea of GMO foods does not scare me. I know he was on a food labeling kick. It seems like a stupid campaign. However, this is not one of his platform issues. He isn't going around giving campaign speeches about GMOs. You have to dig pretty far into the issues to pull this out and ask whether I'd pause my support for him because of it.
  
Anti-gun:
  
Full stop. The only way you are ""anti-gun"", is if you do not want them to be legal. It's all in the phrasing. He wants gun control. That isn't anti-gun. It's anti-""do anything you want with any gun, anytime, anywhere"".

1. Labeling is an attempt to ban GM products, it is not to educate. Many anti-GMO activists state this explicitly. http://files.vkk.me/images/44218639cd7ad0c686050a38c3913bed2c7caf3a.png

2. The decades old scientific consensus is that there is no difference in health or safety between GM and non-GM crops. http://i.imgur.com/Dj0MLX1.jpg

3. 'Non-GMO' and 'USDA Organic' labels already exist. 

4. There is no compelling reason to mandate a 'life-style label'. Consider religious groups mandating all non-halal or non-kosher foods be labeled instead of the other way around.

5. Given there is no compelling scientific reason for a mandatory label, such laws run afoul (ironically) of free speech. This is the primary reason the law will be struck down in court. 

6. Labeling laws (as stated so far) would cause serious logistical issues, because it would require completely separate handling and storage of different varietals, a chain of custody would be required from farmer to processing plant. A state passing such a law would be in effect legislating across state boundaries and be struck down under the commerce clause. This is a secondary reason the law it will be struck down in court.

7. Adding to the expense of food with no compelling reason is dumb. You don't see anti-GMO activists trying to label mutagentic hybrids or pesticide use, why do you think that is? Hint, because organic producers use both. 

8. There is no well defined definition of what constitutes a GMO. Everything from artificial selection to transgentics are genetically modified in one sense and only activists seem to confuse Genetically Engineered with Genetically modified. This is another reason the law will be struck down in court. 

9. Most GM crops are animal feed or are processed to the point that there is nothing ""GM"" about the product. Maybe you can point to the ""GM"" part of a sugar molecule. How can such a thing be meaningfully labeled or enforced? This is another reason the law will be struck down in court.

I'm fine with his stance on free trade - I think free trade is predicated on outdated assumptions and its supporters focus too single mindedly on efficiencies that really only benefit a very small class of people. Finance and commerce have moved beyond the assumptions that validate free trade as unassailable.

Interesting argument.  I should read the book.  However, it seems pretty clear that Sanders is the 21st century (less-socialist) version of Eugene Debs.  And, indeed, I would argue that if our system basically stays the same in the 22nd century, we will have another Debs, Sanders, etc. 

>We live in a world where cooperation between states is much more incentivized than every before in history.

""Cooperation between states"" says absolutely nothing about the class aspects of each state that is supposed to be cooperating.  In fact, this should be more aptly named ""cooperation between the elites of states,"" meaning that it isn't the average American that is somehow cooperating with someone in China, it means that the average *capitalist* is cooperating with another Chinese capitalist.  At best, for the average American, cooperation means a consumer buys a T-shirt made by a Chinese guy making $2 an hour while the American company profits and the Chinese manufacturing company profits.  That is good cooperation for some people, but not for others.  How does having a globalized world somehow remove class agitations between a countries capitalist class and the labor class?

>economists don't stand up for the poor because that means you have no fucking idea conclusions experts in the field have come up with

Okay mate, you're right that I don't know every single conclusion by every single economics professor.  But in reality, those conclusions (I'll run with the premise that they are all beneficial toward the working class) have absolutely zero meaning if those policies are *never implemented*.  What I see in most Western countries (e.g. US, UK, Aus) are neoliberal economics that mostly benefit the elite classes while giving some marginal benefits (better benefits in UK and Aus compared to US) that help the ""pressure pot"" so to speak of class agitations.  But we must admit that in each of those countries capitalists wield enormous power in politics, education, media, etc. 

>are actively willing to dismiss all evidence that are contrarian to your priors.

Really? I don't believe we've had a discussion before.  How can you say this if we have not even discussed any papers in the first place?  You would be right if you said I was skeptical and my reasons for being skeptical lie in the phenomena that most wealth increases in the US go to a certain class of people that just happen to be the richest class.  And how does their wealth continue to grow if not for policies that politicians implement *that are recommended by economists* advising them?

>but that those wages are higher in the long term.

Higher for whom?  Upper middle class and the wealthy class? Sure.  Middle class and lower? I can't agree with that.  The argument against mine is that there have been increases in benefits, but certainly not wages, and it is arguable that these increased benefits are mostly going to certain sectors that can afford them (e.g. tech, Si Valley, etc.) and remain the same in other sectors (service sector).

It also doesn't matter in relative terms within a nation like the US - poor in the US has a car, a big screen TV, an iPhone and three meals a day.   Its not poor like sub-Sahara Africa.

cv9wftn,1,t3_3lty3f,KabIoski,"Sanders' positions on what you've mentioned are a lot more moderate than just being, say, anti-GMO. Not being 100% for something isn't the same as being against it. 


Guns: guns are something of a blind spot for Dems, they end up sounding like they want to ban all guns eventually, which hurts them with a lot of people. Bernie is more moderate on firearms than most Democrats, and even supported a bill to shield gun manufacturers from lawsuits.  On the other side, he voted for the assault weapons ban, but that's a pretty populist position, with just under 60% of Americans in favor of it.

Nuclear power: He's for increased regulation and inspections, and allowing states the freedom to get rid of aging power plants in favor of other renewables. I'd be worried if he wanted to ban them, because nuclear power is a hell of a lot better than coal, and more feasible than solar or wind at the moment, but being in favor of heavy regulation is appropriate in an industry that can be very dangerous if problems occur. He's not as anti-nuke as he is pro-oversight. 

GMOs: he wants to label them, not ban them. Most scientists agree that they don't pose a threat at all, so I'm not terribly concerned about them. I also don't see the harm in labeling them. If people knew how much of the stuff they already eat is GMO, that would get rid of a lot of the stigma around what is increasingly necessary given how much food the world needs.

Free trade: NAFTA, and CAFTA were pretty bad for working class people, and there are serious problems with the TPP, so that doesn't bug me. We should make trade agreements, but they should be engineered to benefit all Americans, not just shareholders. ",0,0,1442898290,1444726035

Why bring up evolution? Evolution, true or not, doesn't answer any meaningful questions, just kicks them down the road. Now that is a politician's behavior!

The people of Vermont, Sanders' constituents, are if not anti-gmo, then in favor of labeling. Labeling is misrepresented as being anti- by the gmo lobbies. At any rate, public information as to what goes into our bodies is a thing almost everyone can get behind.

Nuclear - Vt Yankee has been going strong since 1972. Growing up, we were told it was supposed to shut down for overhaul in the 90s, but it never did. In 2012 it's operating license expired and was continued for another 20 years. Then the owners shut it down voluntarily. They say 'due to economic factors'.

Like GMOs.   There's positive ways of using GMO technology,  and there are anti-productive ways, such as creating crops that use more endocrine disrupting pesticides and herbicides, rather than less, and that make all the crops infertile, thereby locking farmers into buying new seeds yearly from a monopoly.
