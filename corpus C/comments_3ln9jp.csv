Which economic theory does Trump support, you nor I know this since he hasn't released a position paper on the subject. You assume he doesn't know and he won't consult anyone on it, this is just your assumption.

No, I never have stated that, I am just using that as a allegory, which you do not seem to understand the concept of. I do believe that Trump is incredibly ignorant in Foreign Policy matters and have clearly stated that.  I have also dismissed his claims of being the successful businessman like he claims.  No doubt that he would have advisers helping him make these policy decisions, but not knowing sufficient information about these policies, would make him unqualified in any other position of power.  I can have a great team of advisers, yet I will admit I would be more horrible CEO than Elon Musk because of my lack of knowledge in battery and solar technology, the same set of logic applies to the Donald now matter what Limbaugh and Savage tell you.  Donald Trump is the most unqualified presidential candidate we have by a long shot.  ",0,0,1442798247,1444726468

cv7o1as,1,t3_3ln9jp,snacksinhats,"If the redditors over at /r/politics listened to his policy issues during the recent GOP debate instead of just circlejerking over him, they would probably love him. It should surprise no one that he was a lifelong Democrat. After all, he supports higher taxes (particularly higher taxes on the wealthy), increased financial regulations, a foreign policy of ""talking to Putin, to China,"" and used to love universal health care.

Which all falls in line with my personal philosophy of ""whatever /r/politics believes or supports, run in the opposite direction."" Trump has been disastrous, he is disastrous, and he will continue to be disastrous.",-3,0,1442727475,1444726468

Well I'm confused. /r/politics dislikes Trump. You run in the opposite direction. Yet you say Trump is disastrous. ",4,0,1442733192,1444726468
cv7q0ft,0,t1_cv7pp23,snacksinhats,"Poor phrasing on my part. 

I don't like Trump, and neither does /r/politics. I think he's an embarrasment to the GOP and a complete RINO. Trump's contemporary and historical policy positions clearly show why he was a life-long Democrat. /r/politics would probably *love* Trump considering his stance on taxes and universal health care, if only he *stayed* a Democrat. It's hilarious.",0,0,1442734519,1444726468
cv7q35c,0,t1_cv7q0ft,matts2,So your real position is to make fun of /r/politics for not having the wrong position *you* think they should have. How about they don't like Trump because he is an arrogant dishonest racist? ,5,0,1442734839,1444726468
