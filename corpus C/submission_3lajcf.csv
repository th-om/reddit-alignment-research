3lajcf,Is Bernie popular and not talked about? Or is it just my community?,31,Drummer886,"Everyone I know seems to be supporting Bernie, based on Facebook, bumper stickers around town, etc, but he wasn't mentioned once in the debate last night and it doesn't seem that this support is as strong in the bigger picture. I thought I read that he is ahead of Hillary in at least one poll...is he just being ignored by the media or am I just living in a pro-Bernie bubble?

Disclaimer: I live in a college town in the north east.
