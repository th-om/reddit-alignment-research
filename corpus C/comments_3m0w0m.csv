cvbpiwj,0,t1_cvbbk3m,ClockOfTheLongNow,"I'm saying that price gouging isn't a thing that actually occurs.  Pricing exists based on what the market can bear (absent government rules regarding price floors/ceilings and other regulatory situations).

If there's a natural disaster, and everyone is looking for bottled water, and I have a pallet of it, it's not gouging to price it at $50 when I'd otherwise price it at $3.  It instead sends a signal that the resource is scarce and/or difficult to produce, and thus becomes something that only those who truly need it will pay.",0,0,1443036836,1444725195

I believe that the argument is that, in a truly free market, it's justifiable to price products according to what the market will bear. 

Pricing at an artificially low level will create an imbalance on the demand side, resulting in a shortage of the product. Pricing above the constraints of demand will result in the product not selling at all. 

So companies are free to price their products how they wish, regardless of any human or environmental considerations. 

The problem is that it isn't a truly free market because the government allows pharmaceutical companies to patent drugs, which gives them the license to artificially restrict the supply. Also, the federal government invests heavily in the research that goes into developing these drugs. So we're paying for the research. But the corporations are getting the return. Quite a racket. 

If you want truly free markets, eliminate government funding medical research and get rid of patent protections. ",0,0,1443022114,1444725195

Bernie is always first. 

Bernie took seniors across the Canadian border so that they could have affordable drugs. 

He's not just been talking on it - he's been acting on it for the good of his constituency. 

Whether you like sanders or not - whether you support his candidacy or not - he's done a lot more than change his profile picture on social media in the real world for a lot of causes. ",-1,0,1443042404,1444725195
