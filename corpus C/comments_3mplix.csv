cvh08e1,1,t3_3mplix,syncopator,"1. The Clinton Foundation swapping spit with the State Department, namely the Secretary of State.

2. Multiple violations of the FOIA and Federal Records Act.

3. Mishandling of classified material.

Highly unlikely anything that will earn her a conviction, let alone jail time.  *Possibly* number 3, but I don't think anyone but the full-on crazies think she was actually selling/providing foreign actors with classified info.

Taking in all the facts we know right now, I think the most accurate observations go something like this:

* Upon being named pending Secretary of State, Clinton and her team have an overall desire for information control.  Ironically, it's most likely they were more concerned about her *not quite* work-related emails than her actual official correspondence.

* While it may or may not have been her original intention to specifically dodge FOIA, her continued assertion that she purposefully fulfilled those requirements by emailing other government officials on *their* .gov accounts would necessitate that she was aware of the requirements and was avoiding the herself.

* Her confidence, along with that of her top aide, that these communications were under the radar led her to engage in some conversations that she wouldn't have had on a .gov account.  These are the emails she doesn't want anyone to see.  These are the ones that prompted this reply yesterday on *Meet the Press*:

>CHUCK TODD: Can you say with 100% certainty that the deleted emails that the F.B.I.'s not going to find anything in there that's going to cause you to have to explain again?

>HILLARY CLINTON: All I can tell you is that when my attorneys conducted this exhaustive process, I did not participate.

I think it's very clear there is something in those emails she doesn't want exposed.  Maybe it's personal (health? marriage?), maybe it's not.  As it starts to seem more and more likely whatever it is will actually come out, she is getting more and more lawerly with her answers.",2,0,1443457363,1444722859
cvh22rr,0,t1_cvh08e1,jetboyterp,One of the main things she doesn't want exposed is what she really knew about Benghazi.  Nobody gives a rat's arse about her health or marital issues.  ,1,0,1443460105,1444722859
cvh2i4t,0,t1_cvh22rr,syncopator,"What is it that you think she knew about Benghazi, and why do you think she would have kept any such information in her email?

Whether or not anyone gives a rat's ass about her health or personal issues, it's entirely possible that these are the sorts of emails she wanted to make sure and keep private.  More power to her for that.

Make no mistake, I'm sure there is more to the email story than she is addressing and I think whatever is at the bottom of it is stinking worse every day.",1,0,1443460752,1444722863
