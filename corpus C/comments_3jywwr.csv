Edit: Sources

It appears that 4 emails sent to her were classified, but weren't marked classified which shows incompetence on the part of the State Department and the Intelligence Community:

[""Andrea Williams, a spokeswoman for the inspector general for the Intelligence Community, told NPR's Carrie Johnson that at least four emails that were sent through Clinton's private email network ""were classified when they were sent and are classified now."" On the face of it that seems like a simple statement, but the inspector general also found that all of the emails were not marked as classified. That raises questions about how the State Department and the Intelligence Community handled sensitive information.""](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/24/425839486/report-officials-seek-criminal-inquiry-over-clintons-use-of-private-email)

As for the emails she's sent that are classified they weren't classified when she sent them:

[""That's despite 125 of those emails -- which weren't classified at the time -- being retroactively classified before they were released. All or portions of some unclassified emails are redacted, too. The emails show Clinton was a little obsessed with criticism from Fox News, once closely tracked a trade dispute involving gefilte fish and was eager to check out NBC's ""Parks and Recreation"" and CBS' ""The Good Wife.""](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/31/politics/hillary-clinton-classified-emails/)

In almost any source you can find on the topic it clearly states that the emails that are deemed classified that Clinton sent were not classified when she sent them, but then they go on to ask posing questions that have already been answered like ""Will this embarrassed Clinton since she said she sent no classified information?"" Uhhhhh no, it won't embarrass her and it shouldn't. You clearly just stated that they weren't classified when she sent them . They're just trying to frame it in a certain way. 

If this email situation weren't in the news there'd be a lack of scandals surrounding Hillary and since people are sick of Benghazi that's why this is being drug out the way it is. 

[""Washington (AFP) - Around 150 more of the emails that former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton kept on a private server have been retroactively deemed classified, the State Department said.......... But, in a revelation that will embarrass Clinton as she campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination, officials said many of these mails have now been ruled classified.""](http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-scores-more-clinton-emails-retroactively-classified-2015-8#ixzz3l4YR2fQo)

And for the record I'm a Sander's supporter. I'm going to vote for him, but I don't like when shit like this is flaunted as a ""scandal"" when there isn't one. It detracts from the topic at hand.

So if you're in a technical field and you have specific system performance specs for a weapon system like Tomahawk, that would probably be marked as secret. If you are trained in proper classification marking and handling and came across that information you would know that it should be marked ""secret"". If an enemy country had those performance specs they could use it to develop counter weapons and strategies which would damage the United State's ability to perform war. Or if we came across information that says ""The United States intentionally helped Putin and his efforts in Ukraine"". This would be marked ""Top Secret"" as it would be severely damaging to the United States and its interests. Clinton was trained and would know this.

""They did it too"" is no defense. Is Trey Gowdy even cleared to review and handled classified information? Has he gone through background checks? Has he been briefed on the proper handling and disposal of classified information? Can he originate classification data? Has he signed non-disclosure documents?

I would guess that he hardly expected classified information to be present on a personal email server, it's that crazy.

Classification guidelines exist.

She was an originating authority (meaning she was trained and authorized to mark information/emails with the correct classification). 

Claiming that since the emails were unmarked and had to be ""retroactively"" classified shows the ignorance of how government deals with classification. The fact that Clinton did not mark classification on information that any 5 year old could tell was sensitive information is wrong conduct for any person who has deal with classified information before. On top of that she went through and deleted thousands of emails (which violates the rules for correct disposal of classified material). Ignorance is never a defense for classified spillage, especially someone of her position that clearly knows better.

In short information is classified even without markings as guidelines already exist that specify what is sensitive unclassified, confidential, secret, and top secret. It is *highly* unlikely that information at that time wasn't at least sensitive and later was escalated to secret.

""Nonetheless, Dan Metcalfe, who was the head of the Justice Department's Office of Information and Privacy from 1981 to 2007, blasted Clinton in an op-ed in Politico. He said what was ""**unprecedented**"" actually was Clinton's exclusive use of private email and her own Internet service provider in lieu of an official account ""so that the records of her email account would reside solely within her personal control at home.""

That means ""she managed successfully to insulate her official emails, categorically, from the FOIA, both during her tenure at State and long after her departure from it — perhaps forever."" He called that ""a blatant circumvention of the FOIA by someone who unquestionably knows better.""""

>It was not illegal

""It would be illegal for anyone to store classified information in an unauthorized way, like, say, on an unauthorized personal email server.""

And because she perfectly isolated her emails from the outside, we have no idea if she stored classified information or committed this illegal act or not because she was the filter when deciding what is non-work related and what is work related. 

""The law was amended in late 2014 to require that personal emails be transferred to government servers within 20 days. But that was after Clinton left office. Watchdog groups conceded that she may not have violated the text of the law, but they argue she violated the spirit of it.""

Do we know how safe her email server is and if any information has been hijacked by other nations' intelligence departments, not fully, because she had exclusive access. That is why what she did was wrong.

Let's recap...

* [""The Arkansas Project""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Project): The Arkansas Project was a series of investigations (mostly funded by conservative businessman Richard Mellon Scaife) that were initiated, as some believe, with the intent of damaging the reputation of President Bill Clinton.[1] Scaife spent nearly $2 million on this anti-Clinton project.[2]

* [That was followed up with a 6 year,  $50 million, tax-payer funded Republican investigation.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/whitewater-case-closed/)

* [Then, when she ran in 2008,  there was the infamous Koch-backed group ""Citizens United"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_\(organization\)) (We tend to remember the court case, but forget that the group was an anti-Hillary swiftboat group, trying to run an anti-Clinton movie on TV)


* And now there is the 15 month long, taxpayer-funded $4 million dollar Republican investigation into Benghazi, which by the time it's over (just before the  2016 election ""coincidently"") [will be the longest running congressional investigation in American history](http://y5vrc2wvk3a38jbuh4dvzsqnt4.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/unnamed2.png).

Having a private server would allow her to do just that.  

  Having a private server would allow her a far larger degree of control than having to submit to Gov ""NIPR"" rules and regulations.  

My mother was a prior secret service member and explained to me that Hillary was in fact like that even before Bill's little (ahem) problem.

Additionally, she could work on her campaign and do government work from the same server.  I'm not certain but I'm pretty sure she wouldn't be allowed to do so if it was a gov server.  It's simply more efficient for her.


Additionally, it's no secret that she's only nice in public.  Having a private server allows he more freedom to be her self when chastising subordinates as there's less chance that someone monitoring the server would steal the info  and use it for political gain.

Anecdotally, I has a coworker who used to work at [WHCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Agency) when she was in the Army, and claims that the Clintons would avoid using the (DOD-run) Switchboard whenever possible because they thought that the military was ""out to get them"".  That's the level of paranoia we're dealing with here.

Not saying that they are right or are sane to use a personal server for government business based on their paranoia(In fact, I think the US Attorny should have filed charges awhile ago), but that's the reasonable, non-conspiracy reason.  The Clintons are paranoid.",1,0,1441685139,1444731928

So far there has been no evidence that this is the case. HRC is not an idiot and she's not a villain. She is a seasoned diplomat that's been running for president. Why would she break the law like this? It serves little purpose and could permanently damage her campaign

I can't for the life of me see the conspiracy in that and while it's not a reasonable reason to actually have your own server (such as security, convenience etc), it is for sure a reasonable reason for as to why she might decide to have her own server, which is how I interpret OPs question.

It doesn't necessarily mean that they have broken the law, just that they have that level of arrogance.

As for whether it's conspiracy, maybe we just have different understandings of what it means. Going by the [dictionary definition](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conspiracy?s=t), it would for a start require more than one person to be in on it, so the answer of ""Hillary is arrogant enough to think she should have her own server"" would not be a conspiracy.
