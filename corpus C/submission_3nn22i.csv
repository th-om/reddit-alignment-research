3nn22i,Why has the country moved to the right on gun control?,114,tyzad,"Political discourse on gun control in the US has shifted to the right in recent years. Liberals have typically favored stricter regulations, and conservatives have typically opposed them, but in the 1980s and 1990s, there was much more of a slant in favor of gun control compared with what appears now to be a slant against it.

As evidence, Ronald Reagan wrote a letter to Congress in 1994 urging them to support a ban of assault weapons, something which would probably be political suicide for a Republican candidate today. The 1994 Assault Weapons ban easily passed Congress and was signed into law. 7 Senate Republicans crossed party lines to support the legislation in 1994. Conversely, the 2013 Assault Weapons Ban failed by a significant margin, with 15 Senate Democrats crossing party lines to oppose the legislation. Not even background check legislation has been able to make it into the House.

Why the complete shift in discourse? Is it simply because gun control has been proven ineffective, and legislators have been responsive to that? Or is it because of the increasing power of the gun lobby?
