Lawyers are required to make motions that aren't likely to succeed and do so all the time.

For example.  The Clinton's didn't abuse their office to line their pockets when Bill was president, were sued constantly while in office, spent over 8 million dollars of their own money defending against bullshit lawsuits, and as a result managed to leave office *6 million dollars in debt*.  At this point neither was employed and they were, again, *6 million dollars in debt*.  The speaking gigs weren't a thing yet so they had no idea how they were going to pay this off.

The highest their combined net worth had been up to that point was 2 million dollars, so they now owed three times more than the largest amount of money they'd ever had.  Both were born to middle class families, not wealthy ones, so they couldn't pull a Romney and ask their parents for help.

But at that time they were unemployed and in extreme debt, considering bankruptcy.

Even with Bernie Sanders on her heels, he still trails her across the country by more than 20%. His support is only strong among white liberals, who only make up about 33% of the democratic party's voting block.

It was one thing when Obama won as an incumbent: they could then claim the narrative ""well, Incumbents always win, and we taught him a lesson anyways, see how his numbers are down?"".

It's Bill Clinton talking about the movie ""The Hunting of The President"".  Not only is he an amazing speaker, but he says something very similar about the 'southern strategy', the evangelical vote, and how the GOP had assumed they had a magic formula to keep the white house in their hands for the forseeable future.

He thinks THAT is what drove the animosity to him. He broke the spell of Reagan. The American public rejected the GOP.  And he was punished for that.",8,0,1442119982,1444729741

cuzqzau,1,t3_3kq70o,,"I think it's really important to understand three psychologies when trying to understand the Clinton scandal ""thing"".

One is the Republican congressional narrative through the Obama administration. The whole birther movement was this idea that they could build a case against Obama built on insinuation and innuendo and unprovable suggestion and that they could push an atmosphere of what I call low threshold facts. This persisted as the main political mechanism of rallying their constituency and framing political dialog as they made fallacious or sensationalistic arguments against everything from the Iraq withdrawal to Obamacare to Iran. They know they don't win on numbers using coherent argument, so they've carefully crafted an entire vocabulary of obstructionist, half-truth, false outrage. This is the new Republican strategy in total. 

Benghazi was originally brought up in the manner it was using these sorts of rhetorical vehicles - suggesting Clinton was lying and covering up some willful or negligent ignorance of the precipitating events around Benghazi and was therefor responsible. Again, we see innuendo, insinuation and low-threshold accusation which was repeatedly rejected, refuted, and turned down by the American people as insubstantive. But, that's not relevant. The burden of consequence one would normally associate with poor argument and falsehood doesn't apply to the Republican rhetorical machine, because there's no meaningful, functional consequence for error. Misrepresentation is picked up on a Monday, at the start of a news cycle, it's used to fuel a few days of contextualized anger and outrage in the media and by pundits, it's disproven or shown irrelevant, and quietly put down on Friday - with no review, with no expectation of change, with no consequence. And the next week it happens again. The ""Clinton is hiding something"" concept started there. That she knew what the intelligence was saying and somehow she (or others in the Obama administration...so...she) misrepresented the intelligence somehow. That amorphous idea of duplicity is sewn in the Republican faithful, and now they just need to redirect it to faux scandal after faux scandal for low-risk, high-reward public opinion influence.

The second psychology I would call out here is the Occupy subset of the left. They generally view the Sanders/Warren argument of ""white privileged entitlement is actively dismantling and destroying everything...and the answer is to be as polarized as possible"". They don't just resent Clinton as a member of the establishment, but they also resent the idea that there could be a set of answers which don't paint the political landscape in such stark, us vs them terms. That's where most of the distaste for her comes from on a site like this. They have a tared state in which they view Clinton negatively, and really, they've just taken up this issue as a way to confirm their bias. But at the end of the day, as much as they might like to wave around this ""Clinton is untrustworthy"" idea, they are coming from a fundamentally divergent political stance, and I'd argue that's a much larger mechanism.

The third, obviously, is the media. The media latches on like a parasite to anything they think will get page views or viewer shares. If it's the Kardashians, they'll play that. If it's MH-whatever, they'll play that. They don't really care. And more importantly, they don't really have anything to gain by flatly or coherently defining the terms of the issues which come up - they desperately try to milk any scent of scandal they can from issues. 

So, all that said, I'm not ""defending"" her use of a private email server. But I think the weight of the issue is misdefined. The state department email servers (which are for non-classified information) are, along with the rest of the government's servers, regularly hacked. The best argument is that ""politicians should use public servers to control the evidence chain""...but there's nothing scandalous about that (unless people want there to be). It's just a policy shift which is slowly happening in government. And given the witch-hunt mentality of the right, I think it's just as possible (given that there's literally 0 proof that Hillary was hiding anything - specifically the smoking gun on Benghazi which isn't there and started this whole thing) that she deleted the servers to make sure information release happened through the State Department, and not some overzealous republican hacker.",9,0,1442120343,1444729741

To me, Sanders cannot, and will not work across the aisle. He will go as far as going against his views to do exactly opposite of the Republican party. Clinton, from her past, would actually work with the other side, and make compromises that both sides can agree upon. 

To me, being able to work with the opposition is probably the most important thing in government to me. Both sides want something, and rather than getting everything, and pissing half the population off, or getting nothing, and pissing the other half off, someone who can bridge the gap is I think the most important trait for a President.

Sanders has shown to me that he cannot and will not work with the other side, often going against his deeply held views to make a show that he is against Republicans. Clinton to me would be better than Sanders in this fact.

While I won't vote for either, and this is no endorsement for either, but if for some reason I was forced to vote for either one, I would definitely vote for Clinton over Sanders.
