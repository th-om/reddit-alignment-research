3lnheb,How does black on black crime invalidate #blacklivesmatter?,205,maxgarzo,"It's something I constantly see used as a rebuttal to dismiss the core message of #blacklivesmatter, the use of black on black crime to suggest ""If you think your lives matter, why do you kill each other?""

This seems to assume that blacks killing other blacks is some sort of tacit implication that blacks don't care about other blacks, and I have serious problems with this.  The first, most obvious and frequently referred to notion is that **(1) we are not a monolith**, just as other cultures are not a hive-minded megalith of people who despite a shared heritage, they do enjoy diversity of thoughts, ideals and attitudes about the world they inhabit; black people are no different.  We are individuals, we may in some cases share a strong social and cultural root system, but at the end we are still individuals and we should be treated as such.  Positing black on black crimes as a dismissal of the #blacklivesmatter movement strips us of our agency and individuality.

What's more, and even more frustrating is that **(2) arguments that bring up 'black on black crimes' make the faulty assumption that blacks killing other blacks is somehow a unique phenomenon of western culture or is otherwise more reprehensible than the norm**.  Whites kill other Whites, Latinos the same, as have Asian-Americans; I can't reconcile in my mind how a statement against gun-control such as ""guns don't kill people, *people* kill people"" can exist in the same societal sphere where the notion of using violence against blacks delivered *by* blacks ignores crime statistics within other racial groups.

Lastly, usage of the 'black on black' posit **(3) wholly ignores what is at the core of #blacklivesmatter, which is an outcry that extends well beyond the presumed social-boundaries of Black America**.  To reinforce this, I go no further than [a New York Times Editorial on the topic](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/opinion/the-truth-of-black-lives-matter.html?partner=socialflow&smid=tw-nytnational&smtyp=cur):

>Demonstrators who chant the phrase are making the same declaration that voting rights and civil rights activists made a half-century ago. They are not asserting that black lives are more precious than white lives. They are underlining an indisputable fact â€” that the lives of black citizens in this country historically have not mattered, and have been discounted and devalued. 

I'm a black guy, and I remain of the people I know one of the strongest supporters of the #blacklivesmatter movement and the most dedicated to being willing to engage with detractors of the movement to affect hearts and minds. I don't like closing people out or stripping them of their agency to have an opinion, but this is one tactic I'm left eating crow on, and I cannot understand how one rationalizes it.

So, I'd like to hear what some of you have to say, if you believe it to be the case-why, or if not, but maybe you have an opinion on why others may think it's the case, share that too.  I'm here with an open mind and I want to learn something.",55,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lnheb/how_does_black_on_black_crime_invalidate/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442731851,1444726376
