cvf4zje,1,t3_3mi1mn,ndimoro,It will *not* be Chuck Schumer. After he pulled support for the Iran deal that sealed his fate. ,9,0,1443300669,1444723376
cvfuc7m,0,t1_cvf4zje,fgsgeneg,"Chuck Schumer has other problems than just being the Senator from Israel. He has a tendency to jump the gun on issues rather than deliberate and then act. We call him ""There oughtta be a law Chuck"" in my household because of his propensity to try to outlaw stupid, a decidedly losing battle. When someone attempts the Darwin Award his first reaction is to make that activity illegal. There's more than enough that's illegal already.",2,0,1443368485,1444723376
cvfudz0,0,t1_cvfuc7m,ndimoro,"Yup. That's New York politics in a nutshell. Schumer also spoke at my commencement, ruining and otherwise uplifting and positive day for me. :(",1,0,1443368578,1444723376

The far-left will want Warren/Sanders, but their support will be limited to reddit/FB/twitter. The next leader will be Durbin.",3,0,1443299280,1444723380
cvfjr6s,0,t1_cvf47r6,evanb_,It doesn't even matter who has public support. Leadership positions are usually ignored by most Americans and determined by party confidence.,1,0,1443331749,1444723380

cvffhs7,1,t3_3mi1mn,Debageldond,"Everyone was saying Schumer, but I think opposing the Iran deal likely shifted it to Durbin, who took to the media to make a point about how much he supported it.

cvg2qop,1,t3_3mi1mn,rikross22,"There will be a fight between schumer and durbin for it. It will happen behind closed doors, they will lobby for votes, durbin will try to leverage the Iran deal. I'm not sure who will end up winning out. ",1,0,1443382021,1444723380
cvgtu7s,1,t3_3mi1mn,brucejoel99,"Reid has already endorsed Chuck Schumer to succeed him after he retires at the end of 2016.

""I think Schumer should be able to succeed me,"" is what Reid said when he announced his retirement.

He even predicted that Schumer, the No. 3 Senate Democrat in leadership and a close friend, would win the Democratic leader post without opposition. He said that the other likely contender, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (the No. 2 Senate Democrat in the leadership), would stand down for Schumer.",1,0,1443446004,1444723380
