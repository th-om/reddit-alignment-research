The government is also turning a $40 billion annual profit on the student loan industry - effectively a tax on students trying to move up from lower income levels to higher ones (not something we should punish/discourage).

Restrictions include:

* A 20-week ban
* Stripping Planned Parenthood of $1.4 million
* Requiring a medically unnecessary ultrasound be performed and a script read to patients
* Prohibiting public hospitals from entering into ""transfer agreements,"" which abortion providers need to operate (similar to admitting privileges in Texas, Alabama, etc). This directly caused the closure of 5 clinics.
* Related to the above, Kasich's most recent budget required that the transfer hospital be within 30 miles of the clinic, which targets clinics like the one in Toledo who has an agreement with a hospital approx 50 miles away (Ann Arbor)
* A provision that forbids state-funded rape crisis centers from discussing abortion

Kasich would rebuttal saying he is a jackass and to not look and negotiate is jackassery.

I am not a woman and I do believe that at some point, while still in the womb, a fetus is a baby and is alive. That said, abortion is a real option. It should be a last resort after education and birth preventatives but it is an option nevertheless.

I agree that there should be a certain term ban (with provisions such as medically required) but I personally feel like the there should be a cut off on the free choice to do it without it being medically necessary. When should that date be? Well I'm not a woman or a doctor or ever had a kid so I don't know.",1,0,1443110210,1444724782
cvcyox6,0,t1_cvcnxtc,DarthGinger,"You and I share some similar stances. It's a thorny issue where you have to balance the woman's right to bodily autonomy and the life of the fetus. In my opinion, the point of viability is the tipping point. Prior to viability, the mother's right to bodily autonomy prevails. Once the fetus is viable, its life become more important than the mother's bodily autonomy.

I'm actually mostly fine with a 20-week ban. The earliest a baby has been born and survived is 21 weeks and 5 days. I think 20 weeks might be a little early, but it's acceptable in my mind. And obviously, there needs to be exceptions for medical necessity.

What I'm not alright with is the absurd restrictions that some states are putting on abortion providers under the pretext of ""protecting women's health."" They are thinly veiled attempts to deny access to a constitutional right, and that is unacceptable.

cvcis76,1,t3_3m5ocm,RedErin,"For those saying that you don't think abortion is an issue because you don't think RvW will be overturned. Please read this comment about what states are doing to limit abortion providers. 

>They aren't trying to be medically correct, but to prevent those who arguably most need abortions from being able to legally access them.
The earliest most fetal illnesses or deformities are diagnosed is typically around 18 weeks, but many women may not get that ultrasound until 20 weeks or even later. Even if a woman has the ultrasound at exactly 18 weeks, by the time she's referred for a more advanced one, and sees specialists, the state's 20 week abortion limit has come and gone.

>Now she either has to travel out of state to obtain an abortion at thousands of dollars of personal cost, or she is forced to carry the pregnancy through even if she and her doctors believe it is not in the best interests of the fetus to do so.
That's if her doctor chooses not to lie to her about her fetuses' health, which Arizona is making legal to prevent abortions.[1]
Let's say she manages to make it under the 20-week limit after being diagnosed with a fetal illness:

>If she's poor and relies on state health insurance or charity services to receive prenatal care, it's illegal for those organizations to even refer her for an abortion or suggest it. The state is just looking out for her by making sure abortion is her decision, and that her doctors and others can't influence her by mentioning a safe and (barely) still legal medical procedure.
But let's say that her doctor doesn't exercise their legal right to lie to her about the health of her fetus, and that she has enough money to be privately insured or she seeks out information about abortion on her own, and she still wants that abortion:

>She'll have to wait at least 24 hours to obtain her abortion after first seeking one out per the law, and she'll have to be counseled on state-mandated topics such as the anatomical features of her fetus, details about her abortion procedure, the risks as defined by the state, and her ""alternatives"" including resources for parenting and child support.


>Which of course is all horrible to be subject to if you're seeking an abortion for medical reasons like fetal health as most women getting an abortion that late in pregnancy do (not that it isn't horrible always), but the state is just saving lives, not sparing emotions here.

>And if she comes in under the ""20 week"" limit, she'll need permission from a parent if she's under 18. 17 is old enough to be the teenage mother of a sick child, or the parent of a child who dies, but it isn't old enough to seek out an abortion on your own. You can go to court for a judicial waiver... but there's that time limit to make it almost impossible for you to make it. And if you don't get the judge to agree in time, remember that they're currently trying to make it illegal for anyone but your parent to transport you across state lines to procure an abortion.
If you're a university student whose university has a hospital, the state protects you by requiring you to travel elsewhere for your abortion: she'll have to go to a different hospital or abortion facility, as university hospitals can't legally perform one except to save your life.

>These abortions also cost a lot more money than first trimester abortions done for non-medical reasons. The state also protects her from not ""choosing life"" by making it illegal for her insurance to pay for the abortion, even if they believe it is medically justified, unless she had previously opted to purchase abortion insurance for that rainy day or the abortion would save her life. Exceptions for fetal health? Why bother.

>But let's just say that this woman finally shows up at her doctor's office (after a different doctor didn't exercise their legal right to lie to her to prevent an abortion, or in some cases their legal obligation not to discuss abortion with her), who happens to be a doctor who complies with Arizona's excessive and targeted counseling and record-keeping requirements not imposed on other medical providers, and she makes it in before 20 weeks (or late 19 weeks, really, don't forget about the waiting period) and she can somehow pay for her care out of pocket or get help paying for it, and she's an adult or has parental permission, and her doctor chooses to ignore the fact that Arizona never repealed their unconstitutional ban on all abortions except those to save a woman's life with a penalty of 2-5 years imprisonment,[2] and she gets counseled about the life her sick fetus could never have because the state gave the doctor a script they must read, and she finally gets up on the table to have her procedure after the mandatory 24 hour waiting period.

>The state's there to protect her too, by outlawing certain abortion procedures even if the doctor believes they are the safest and most appropriate for that woman.
Laws that limit abortion to 20 weeks or sooner do nothing to reduce voluntary first trimester abortions, and they definitely do nothing to reduce the need for voluntary abortions. They do however impose extreme burdens on parents in horrible situations and on the doctors providing care for them, and provide a political win for the cause of ""saving babies.""
It isn't about how a doctor would calculate gestation at all. It's just one more step on the state's (and country's) agenda to make abortion increasingly stigmatized and increasingly inaccessible.",1,0,1443101898,1444724794
