""Today our concern must be with that future. For the world is changing. The old era is ending. The old ways will not do.  Abroad, the balance of power is shifting. .... Communist influence has penetrated further into Asia, stood astride the Middle East and now festers some ninety miles off the coast of Florida. Friends have slipped into neutrality--and neutrals into hostility....

Here at home, the changing face of the future is equally revolutionary. The New Deal and the Fair Deal were bold measures for their generations--but this is a new generation. ....

A peaceful revolution for human rights--demanding an end to racial discrimination in all parts of our community life--has strained at the leashes imposed by timid executive leadership.... 

Are we up to the task--are we equal to the challenge? Are we willing to match the Russian sacrifice of the present for the future--or must we sacrifice our future in order to enjoy the present? ....

So to alleviate your deep sense of sorrow for American troops, they changed the policy to avoid direct contact with the enemy.

It was justified to invade even without the bin Laden link.  We largely eradicated Al Qaeda to where they are barely a regional player- in its place is ISIS who is feared but has little capacity to carry out an attack in the west.  ISIS' main role in foreign policy is for western and Israeli hawks to have a ""Goldberg"" (ironic) to use to rally support for military and police resources.",1,0,1442064906,1444729805
cuz50a1,0,t1_cuyy8h9,kirkisartist,"> The Taliban were an ultra-right movement who oppressed women and had an authoritarian hold on Afghanistan. It was justified to invade even without the bin Laden link.

The Taliban ain't the only one and we can't afford to police the world. Especially if they *don't want to be policed*. The native Afghans loved the Taliban, just like our rabid sheep support the troops^tm. 

So based on your backwards principals, these terrorists have every right to come to our land, bomb our civilians in pursuit of a few of our authoritarians (you) to set us straight. Please just think about the principals you are setting.

>We largely eradicated Al Qaeda to where they are barely a regional player.

While I'm not sad to see Al Qaeda gone, they were an arbitrary threat. The dipshit with the fire cracker strapped to his ballsack was Al Qaeda. The Tsarnaev brothers were not. Timothy Mcveigh was not.

ISIS is dangerous because they are the result of the last resort. There is no turning back for them. Many of them were just Sunni Baethists. They were hunted down and exiled. The Shiite govt excluded Sunnis and didn't respect their rights. Syria couldn't support them, now they're fighting like a cornered pitbull with rabies.",0,0,1442078676,1444729805
