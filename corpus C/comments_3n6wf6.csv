This could be solved by making birthright citizenship ‘opt-out’ for parents who can prove that their child is entitled to another citizenship (namely their own, through parentage) at birth. Current U.S. and Canadian law does not allow parents to opt out at birth, and parents cannot renounce a child’s citizenship under any circumstances ; birthright citizenship is *imposed*, not *granted*. (Historically, *jus solis* in English law, even before the U.S. was founded, was aimed at forcing people to be subjects of the king.)

I find this a bit disturbing and think this is just as unfair for a person to be “bound” with obligations to a country to which he has almost no ties, as it is to be “entitled” to rights from it (which is the usual argument against anchor babies).
