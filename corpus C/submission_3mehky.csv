I don't really understand the plan, what would having the fingerprints of people who crossed the border legally solve?",19,BartWellingtonson,">""We should be able to track people with their fingerprints.,"" the Republican presidential candidate said during an interview Thursday morning on CNN's ""New Day."" ""They overstay their visas, and then they go to use facilities in the United States, and we can tell them: 'You overstayed your visa â€” it's time to go.'""

What facilities is he referring to, and what would have to be done to implement that plan? Would the United States government need to take the fingerprints of all people in the country and require fingerprint scanning at all US owned buildings? That sounds very unconstitutional.
