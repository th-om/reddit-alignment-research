cv5zxet,1,t3_3lg5yo,rkrish7,"I'm fairly confident the dems would win in this scenario. Of the overall electorate, I think that Bernie Sanders takes less away from Hillary than Trump would from the republicans. ",11,0,1442593599,1444727103
cv64qm9,0,t1_cv5zxet,Pollster101,"Depending on the GOP nominee, I think it would be quite possible for neither candidate to get 270 electoral votes, and Congress would make the decision. That would cause some chaos. The House gets to vote on the President, while the Senate gets to vote on the VP. 

The rules are interesting. In this scenario, we have 4 candidates getting a chunk of the votes. However, the House can only consider the top 3. Would Bernie or Trump win more electoral votes? Sanders could pick up a few NE states while Trump may pick up a few random states in middle America (I'm thinking non-southern red states). Either way, the Republicans would still win in the House as they are required to re-vote until one candidate has a majority. Eventually, the Republican candidate would come out on top.

The VP gets voted on by the Senate. Which is held by Republicans, so it would also go their way. 

But....let's imagine a scenario where Sanders is **very** strong as an independent and Trump doesn't run as an independent (maybe he is the nominee or just drops out). If this were the case, I think it is also very likely that the Democratic Party sees a huge increase in both the House and Senate. It's more likely that they re-take the Senate, but if Sanders is resonating with voters, the House is likely to shift significantly to the left as well. Now, the Democrats have taken one (or both) of the chambers of Congress back, but because of electoral college rules, they have to let Congress pick the winner of the Presidential election. Americans just overwhelmingly supported a shift to the left....but Congress still represents the right due to electoral victories in 2010, 2012, and 2014. So, the old Congress will get to vote on the new President. We could end up with a Republican President and VP, appointed by a Republican Congress that was just voted out of power. That actually may be the catalyst that creates change in our electoral system. ",3,0,1442600939,1444727103

cv61ti1,1,t3_3lg5yo,stan13ag,"If each of them won a few states, then nobody would win the majority of electoral votes.  Congress would vote on the president and it would probably be the republican candidate.",3,0,1442596466,1444727103
cv64wl7,0,t1_cv61ti1,Pollster101,"I mentioned this in another reply, but a very interesting scenario would arise if the electoral votes were split between Hillary, Sanders, and Trump/any GOP nominee. Hillary and Sanders could get to 270 votes combined, but not individually. Thus, the voters could have indicated a strong shift to the left, but end up with a GOP president because of Congress being held by Republicans.

That could be the catalyst for electoral reform. It definitely wouldn't sit well with many. ",2,0,1442601194,1444727103

cv6m3e5,1,t3_3lg5yo,avatoin,"The biggest risk is that Sanders and Trump combine still just enough electoral votes to prevent any candidate from getting a majority. This sends the election to the House, who likely vote for the Republican ticket. 

Sanders is only a threat, however, if he runs specifically to hurt Clinton. He can't afford a national campaign, but he could try to steal New England. This could force Hillary to fight a two sided battle, trying to defend her claims in normally safe Democrat states, as well as winning the battleground States. No big money, however, is backing Sanders. 

Trump can probably only hope to mess with the races in the battle ground States. If he steals primarily Republican votes, then Hillary wins. However, if he is somehow stealing potential Hillary votes, then he could potentially swing the election to the Republicans. We could even see another Florida if the race is close in Florida. Trump has enough personal wealth, that he would be a bigger threat than Sanders could ever be as a third party. ",1,0,1442633426,1444727107
