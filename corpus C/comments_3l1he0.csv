The decision should be based on maximizing the return on the asset, not whether it's profitable for the contractor. Oil is at a low right now, and it looks likely to stay low for some time. If it were my asset? (hey... it is!) Then I'd definitely wait until oil is at least back up over $100 before I sold it. It's not going anywhere.


Edit: I'm just guessing that these areas have been opened for exploration. No actual production deals... right? If that's the case? Then I have zero problems with this. Nobody will know the price-point that these fields might be profitable at until they're explored. If oil-companies want to do some test drilling to see if they might want to make an offer?

I'll have to check again, but my understanding is that Saudi Arabia is keeping production constant. There might be new fields in Angola or in Equatirial Guinea coming on-line... that might explain rising OPEC numbers.


I wouldn't worry about Americas oil industry. They don't make the money on the oil, anyway. They make the money on exploring and drilling and piping and refining and financing.

cv3g4rc,0,t1_cv34vhm,zigmeister22,"OPEC output isn't rising, it is just not decreasing production as demand has dropped.  Usually, when demand drops and thus prices drop, they cut output to get the price back up to where they want it to be.  This time, they haven't done that.  Demand dropped significantly from China, and elsewhere, and OPEC just kept their output the same.  This has caused prices to drop (low demand + high supply).

Most analysts believe they are doing this to accomplish a few goals:

1) Punish Russia.  Russia has massive oil reserves and has flooded the market with oit, and has refused to join OPEC.  Russia's cost to produce requires a higher price, however, so OPEC wants to punish them by making oil too cheap for them to produce.

2) OPEC wants to punish Iran.  Saudia Arabia (Sunni) does not especially like Iran (Shia) and is fearful that Iran will develop a nuclear weapon.

3) OPEC wants to keep its market share (customers) instead of ceding them to others (if they were to cut back production with the goal of raising prices).  This is mostly in reference to U.S. oil production.  If OPEC cut production, with the goal of raising prices, then those customers would go buy from U.S. oil companies, pumping oil in the U.S. (fracking shale formations).  OPEC would rather kill them off, through low prices first.",2,0,1442410374,1444728600
cv3h6qh,0,t1_cv3g4rc,BuckminsterJones,"Thanks. I didn't think OPEC was increasing production. But I disagree that OPEC is intentionally 'doing' anything for any reason, or doing something 'to' anybody. A commodity has boomed, and busted. In the past? This would trigger an OPEC meeting, and production cuts in all OPEC members. But everybody always cheated, and really just wanted SA to cut so that they'd make more money. If anybody is 'doing' anything? It's SA calling bull-shit on the rest of OPEC. And you have to admit they have a point. Closing down the cheapest source first in a falling market makes exactly zero economic sense. 



If SA really wanted to fuck with Russia and Iran? They would actually do what everybody incorrectly assumes that they're doing, and flood the market. But they're just pumping nice and steady. Anything they do impacts a lot of other people, but that doesn't mean that those impacts are why they're doing that thing. Between taking steps to effect the market? And not-taking steps, that also effects the market? Changing production levels in any way would cause more 'they're doing this on purpose!' talk.

There is some merit to your 'calling bullshit' argument, however.  OPEC does seem like it's in trouble and SA may just be allowing it to fall apart (vs. taking the economic hit for the team).

Mexico is opening up their oil now for the first time in 100 years, Iraq is back online 100%, so is Iran.  New tech is now available to harvest previously unthinkable sources of oil (fracking, horizontal drilling, etc.)  These all don't bode well at all for OPEC.",2,0,1442416089,1444728600

I'm sorry, but some of what you say is a bit mixed up. Mexican PeMex is, and has been for decades, one of our biggest suppliers. I think Mexico is just behind Canada as a foreign supplier. Iraq doesn't have control of their northern oil-fields right now, and that production has slowed to a trickle. Fracking and horizontal drilling aren't new technologies... they are expensive technologies, and only make economic sense when oil is high. Fracking has been around since the 1960s, and computer steered drill-bits since the 1980s.


Saudi Arabia, like everybody, wants stability. Oil booming-and-busting all the time is a pain in the ass for everybody. But it's just the nature of the beast. The long lag-time for new production, the speculative futures markets, the sheer volume of value getting wheeled-and-dealed every day, the close dependence on economic growth in general... all make for an inherently volatile market. It's a highly chaotic system. SA can throw a monkey-wrench in and see what happens, but there is no predicting effects with any accuracy. So by doing nothing? They are taking steps to lessen volatility. Stability, of oil prices, of politics, of geo-politics, is the primary agenda.



The powerful always benefit from the status-quo. They got to their position of power operating under the current system... why would they want it to change?

cv3esq3,0,t1_cv3azqh,BuckminsterJones,"I don't think that would make sense... first off, if SA increased production, prices would fall even further, and they wouldn't even make more money. The way I heard it, every non-SA OPEC member was begging SA to cut production, but SA said 'our production costs are the lowest in the world... why should we be the ones to cut?' So they have just maintained production levels. SA doesn't have financial problems so much as a bit of a temporary cash-flow problem. They don't have debt, they have trillions in saved-up cash, and they are spending some of their cash. But they are a loooong way from going into debt, and even if they were, their credit is good.


The real story behind the oil-price collapse is boring. Oil was up over $100, so everybody and their dog went out and drilled, even if their production costs were $90. Typical commodity boom-and-bust cycle. Now? All of those $90 wells are losing money, and their owners are blaming SA, when they only have themselves to blame. The fact that SA has the ability to effect the market gets extrapolated to... every move of the market is the result of something SA did. But that's just not the case.

Each block is leased to a company like Shell/BP/Chevron, known as the ""Operator"". Before they bid on the rights to drill they conduct surveys via 3rd party. The operator decides if a block is worth exploring and will submit a blind bid. Highest bid wins the block. Then the operator must evaluate the formation and come up with a plan to drill a well(s). After the well plan has been created, a rig must be contracted to drill it. Often times outfitted to the operators specifications for the well. A well head built and casing intervals ordered. At this point several years have passed. Finally they begin to drill. Each we'll takes 4-12 months to drill and complete. If it bears any oil or gas, it has to be produced by a production facility, additional pipelines to existing platforms are build or an entire production facility. So from the time the block is leased, it could be 10 plus years before any oil is refined. Oil may be cheap right now, but in 10-15 years when these wells are flowing, oil will be much higher.

They have done things like this before (see quote and article above), and part of the issue is they offer up areas that are too expensive for people to actually want to drill.   Whether this is done as a token gesture or is more just a reflection of the market is up for debate but either way,  Obama could have done tons more over his presidency to grown America's energy industry.  I realize people have their environmental concerns and that's an argument, but I personally am super pro expanding fracking and drilling.

However, I have to imagine that opening up new areas under the ocean is more about the oil market many years from now than it is about the oil market today.  

With that said, I am still not sold, but I don't know enough to be against it.

My biggest complaint is that we need to stop fucking our oceans up.  Fucking our oceans up will have a bigger cost than anything we could gain from the oil under there.  ",3,0,1442328359,1444728620
