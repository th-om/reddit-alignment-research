3l2i9k,Vacant Property Demolition Thought Experiment,22,EasterTheBunny,"Most cities have an area that was once a thriving place in regards to commercial or residential property, but is now full of vacant, degrading buildings. Most of the time, the fix for the property would be to rezone it or divide it up.

Take for instance a shopping mall. When the place was built 40 years ago, the specific location was chosen as it was a high traffic area. Various factors have contributed to the area's decline, but still the building remains. So long as the place was built to code, it could stand for another 60 years easy, but it's too large and too specialized. Demolition is the best solution. At the moment, who foots the bill though? The city has significant interest in removing the building to make way for new development, but does not have the funds to do so. Most of the time, these buildings will sit in limbo for years inviting significant issues that put stress on government services before an investment opportunity will present itself.

Essentially, the property will eventually be re-purposed and the land will be prepped by demolishing any existing structures. This frequently happens in residential and commercial areas. Could this process be cleaned up by applying some rules to improved property ownership?

For instance: a demolition account applied to all structures. The account could be tied to the property or maybe to the structure via the deed. The amount required in the account would depend on the demolition cost at the possible time of demolition. An initial percentage of this amount would have to be placed in the account at the time of construction and payments would be made to the account over a term of the structure's projected useful lifespan in that area. The account transfers with ownership and at the time a municipality condemns the building, the funds cover the demolition.

The goal is to reduce investment cost of abandoned property and reduce liabilities of government services. What might you do to solve this issue?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l2i9k/vacant_property_demolition_thought_experiment/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442340095,1444728141
