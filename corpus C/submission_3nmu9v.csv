3nmu9v,Hypothesis: Democrats can reduce Washington deadlock by moving to the left.,26,Og_The_Barbarian,"Reasoning: Over the last 2 decades, as Republicans moved to the right, so did Democrats. This let Republicans move further to the right. Democrats moving to the left would:

1)	Give Republicans elbow-room to choose less right-wing positions and still be radically opposed to progressive policies;

2) 	Let purple-state Dems and Reps be “moderate” by staking what are currently Democratic positions;

3)	Shift the national conversation, and thus create more space for compromise.


Examples:

1)	Dems in the 90’s wanted single payer healthcare. The Republican response was a free market system. That system became Obamacare, at which point Republicans declared that it was socialism.

2)	Dems in the 90’s wanted significantly stronger environmental regulations. Republicans proposed cap and trade as a free-market alternative (monetizing a negative externality). Now Democrats support cap and trade, so Republicans moved further right.

3)	Dems previously talked about an Australia-style gun buyback to massively reduce the number of guns in America. Now Dems want to close the gun show loophole. Republicans fight any increased gun regulation.

4)	Dems have traditionally supported maintaining or expanding entitlement programs. Obama’s biggest concession during the attempted Grand Bargain was potentially letting Republicans reduce Social Security and Medicare benefits. Now Jeb wants to eliminate Medicare (turning it into a voucher system).

In short, the problem is not political polarization, because there are not 2 polar opposites. There is a far-right party, and a centrist party. America would be better off if it were MORE polarized – if Democrats would stop trying to be centrists and stake out truly leftist positions.
