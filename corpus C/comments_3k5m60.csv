cuuz7ps,1,t3_3k5m60,TheNaBr,">why it seems so many republicans favor a tax cut for the wealthy when they themselves could be better off with tax reform for the middle class.

It seems like that because of Democrat messaging.  Republicans favor tax cuts in general...for example, the George W. Bush Tax cut was a rate cut across the board for all tax brackets.  It wasn't geared toward the wealthy, but the Democratic party used the fact the Rich people pay far more in taxes as a foil against the rate cut.  

Also, when taxes are applied to businesses, the business doesn't just pay that tax itself, it passes that tax on to the customers.  So high tax rates on businesses make cost of living more expensive fot everyone else.  

The other aspect to take into account is the 47% comment from Romney.  47% of the population doesn't pay federal tax.  If anyone is looking to cut taxes to get liquidity back into industry, you're already working at a false baseline.  You only have the option of cutting taxes on wealthier people because non-wealthy people don't pay taxes.

I think we should cut the corporate tax rate, but this sentence that's repeated ad nauseum from supporters of cutting corporate tax rates just doesn't make logical sense when held up to scrutiny.

Businesses are already pricing their products at what they believe will be the optimal price to maximize profit. Taxes are only paid based on profit. If the tax rate is increased, that will not change the optimal price for a business to price their product to maximize profit, it will only change how much of that profit is left over for shareholders after the taxes are paid. 

A company is going to price their product to maximize pre-tax profits. Pricing has fuck all to do with the corporate tax rate.

It would depend on the financial position of the businesses.  The Bush Tax cuts occurred during a recession, so, no I wouldn't expect an immediate drop.  Businesses would continue to make the profit they could in the short term.  I don't think market response is instantaneous.

Can we see any effect at all?  Immediate or otherwise?   What if I were to argue to you that we could increase taxes on businesses without seeing an immediate (i.e., decade long) impact on CPI?  Or is the argument that while we don't see changes when we *decrease* taxes, we will see impact when we *increase* taxes, with data to support said claim coming at a later date?  

> The chart provided relates directly to inflation, which has a lot of factors.

Inflation and the cost of living do have a lot of factors.  If the picture is more nuanced, perhaps the blanket conclusion that 'So high tax rates on businesses make cost of living more expensive fot everyone else.' does not necessarily model the world appropriately?  

> one of which is Federal Reserve policy with interest rates.

Interest rates have been set to near zero for a large portion of the timespan included on that graph; do you think we would have seen a better CPI without said intervention?

You could argue that raising taxes doesn't impact anything.  I wouldn't believe you, but you'd still have your argument.  The problem with leaning on the CPI is that inflation always happens by design.  A drop in tax rate might simply prevent a price increase a few years down the line.  

>Or is the argument that while we don't see changes when we decrease taxes, we will see impact when we increase taxes, with data to support said claim coming at a later date?

Increase or decrease, I think there is a lag regardless.  But you do see a similar dynamic to what you described with gasoline prices.  If there's a refinery problem, gas prices rise immediately...but when those problems are resolved, the gasoline prices fall gradually.  There's also more factors that play into it.  A lot of it has to do with certainty, if people don't know what the tax climate is going to be like, they delay or withhold from actions.  

>'So high tax rates on businesses make cost of living more expensive for everyone else.' does not necessarily model the world appropriately?

It's not a model, it's a simplified statement.  But, in general, if you take more of a business's money, you'd put pressure on them to increase revenue in some way.

>Interest rates have been set to near zero for a large portion of the timespan included on that graph; do you think we would have seen a better CPI without said intervention?

[The Federal Funds rate has been near zero since 2008](http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100103slide1.gif).  I think if we didn't have Federal reserve intervention we would have seen deflation, which is what you were expecting to see on the CPI graph.

cuv50bb,0,t1_cuv2ez5,HealthcareEconomist3,"CPI doesn't measure prices it measures cost of consumption, its a basket of what urban consumers are buying (measured by CEX) multiplied by the average price of those goods in the same markets (different surveys and direct research). The CPI basket reflects that individuals consume more as prices fall, its not a static basket of goods.

In addition CPI is designed for monthly delta only not a long time series, while its errors are sufficiently small to be insignificant when considering monthly changes the error grows exponentially with the length of a time series (one of the reasons why the fed don't use it). CEX misses about 20% of consumption, CPI only covers urban consumers, price research doesn't capture consumption out of metro effectively etc. All inflationary measures also suffer from the problem that they simply don't account for different price experiences between income groups, that high-income households shop at Whole Foods while low-income households shop at the local cheap supermarket has a very significant impact on how they experience prices.

Prices for most goods fell slowly prior to 1980 and then significantly after due to globalization pressures. We see this when we look at [income sensitive measures of inflation](http://www.etsg.org/ETSG2008/Papers/Romalis.pdf) and even [household spending](http://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-1/pdf/a-comparison-of-25-years-of-consumer-expenditures-by-homeowners-and-renters.pdf).

I wish people had a better understanding of prices, the cost of the goods you buy is consistently falling relative to your income,",2,0,1441763764,1444731456
cuvk2ll,0,t1_cuv50bb,passionlessDrone,"> Prices for most goods fell slowly prior to 1980 and then significantly after due to globalization pressures. 

If CPI fails to be a meaningful measure of cost of living, doesn't ignoring services we buy, as opposed to goods, also have an effect at cost of living evaluation time?  Your second link regarding household spending seems to indicate that people spent more on things they had to (housing, medical) and less on things that they didn't have to (transportation, apparel), while spending the same amount of money overall.  

> Homeowners and renters spent roughly the same amount on overall expenditures in 2010 as they did in 1986. However, between those years, their spending habits shifted among the major categories of expenditures. Homeowners and renters spent more of every dollar on housing, personal insurance and pensions, and healthcare, while decreasing the shares spent on transportation, food, and apparel and apparel services.

I guess to my eye this doesn't point a picture of people doing better over time, but rather, treading water at best, and only being able to do so due to a flood of Chinese import 'goods'.  

> I wish people had a better understanding of prices, the cost of the goods you buy is consistently falling relative to your income

What if your income has been standing still?  A new DVD player is cheaper, but your healthcare costs are higher.  The cost of [renting](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304887104579304830053269994) doesn't' appear to be decreasing; something largely consistent with people spending larger shares of their income on housing as seen in your second link.  

If CPI is flawed, and I like some of your explanations of the problems with it, what should we utilize instead?  ",2,0,1441805904,1444731456
