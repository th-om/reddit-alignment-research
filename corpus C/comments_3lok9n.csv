Clinton doesn't necessarily need to die--she needs to drop out of the race, though, or murder a baby on live TV.  She may drop out of the race if something new and especially damning came out about the email scandal, something so bad that she judges that if she gets the nomination, she'll be screwed in the general.  Or, if some other sandal comes out.  Taking inspiration from House of Cards, maybe it's revealed she had an abortion, or cheated on Bill.  There is no lack of scandals a politician may have had that can screw them over ultimately, so chances, from an agnostic point of view, are never 100% a politician will win, *unless* that politician is completely unopposed.  Sanders always stands a chance, if only just because something can always fuck Clinton up.

This includes death, or even a personal tragedy (cancer, family member dies, etc).

Also, 5% is too low.  The betting markets are giving him higher chances than 1 in 20.

He may be in, he may not be in.  I would not be surprised *either* way.

cv7zgoq,1,t3_3lok9n,Cassus_Caritas,"People seem to only talk about Trump and the Republicans, but many people are ignoring the Democrat party, which is also quite in flux.

Bernie has an advantage in that he's different. However, this advantage is also his bane because he's *quite* different. 

Hillary's campaign is 'blah.' Just because Obama did well does not mean she will, especially considering that many people now feel 'blah' about Obama's presidency. Furthermore all of her political ""baggage"" that she brings along in the form of past scandals and controversies will show up again. She is benefiting from the fact that she's considered largely to already be the Democrat's candidate, but feeling towards her is largely ""blah."" 

With people like Trump and Bernie there is excitement and energy, Hillary just feels ""meh."" 

However, Bernie does not have as much media exposure as he would like. While he does have a following, he's not in the news as much as he would like and perhaps need to be. Considering that he's running on what are considered ""taboo"" politics, he needs a lot more media exposure in order to explain his reasoning in order to get support. Bernie's politics alienate many people based on ideology alone. 

I would say Bernie has a fair chance, solely because at the moment people really don't care for Hillary that much. They may just go with her because they feel the need, but not because they are particularly thrilled with her. She represents the establishment in entirety.

Compare Trump's and Hillary's campaign. Trump is a charging bull, constantly in the news and being talked about, even his opposition focuses their discussions based on his topics. Hillary, by comparison, is just there. She has lots of support and lots of backers, but there's no real excitement behind her campaign.

I also understand that Sanders generates excitement within a specific demographic, however, compared to Hillary he has a lot more excitement. It does not matter what demographic the excitement is from. 

I don't doubt Hillary has a chance to win. However, as of now she is quite ""blah"" to many people. Just because she's blah does not mean she's necessarily in trouble.
