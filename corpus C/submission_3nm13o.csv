3nm13o,Liberal bias in journalism is a more function of many more liberals than conservatives in the news media than intentional distortion and partisanship,85,garfangle,"Whenever you hear about complaints from conservatives about liberal media bias, they are not wrong, but misguided in their complaint.

Conservatives complain that most journalists are liberal (which is true) and therefore either are out to get conservatives or craft the news to put a positive spin on liberal ideas and personalities and downplay conservative ones. Moreover, these same journalists have the chutzpah to proclaim their work as unbiased and free of partisanship.

While conservatives have a valid point that the news promulgates more liberal copy than conservative copy this is more a function of the overwhelming number of liberal journalists compared with the number of conservative journalists. Since each person has their own biases and brings their own thinking to their job is it any wonder that what gets reported and highlighted comes from what that person finds interesting and novel?

The New York Times isn't liberal because only the news that is ""fit to print"" is a liberal one, but because its founders, owners, and current employees share a set of values and perspective that lean leftward and thus cover the news and produce copy that comes from their liberal viewpoint.

I'm sure if the Times were ever taken over by a conservative group the stories and persons it wanted to cover would be from a more conservative viewpoint. Instead of writing about income and race inequality the paper would write more about government infringements on personal liberty and private property. Even as the paper moved in a more conservative direction it could still say it is producing the news that is ""fit to print"" because would reflect what the ownership and employees thought was proper and just.

So, the real problem for conservatives is not that the news is biased against them per se, it is because they remain a small part of the news business and therefore wield little influence in the creation and shaping of journalism as it is practiced today.",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nm13o/liberal_bias_in_journalism_is_a_more_function_of/,PoliticalDiscussion,1444073183,1444717039
