3ni23g,Manage the US Federal Deficit,72,HisImperialGreatness,"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/13/weekinreview/deficits-graphic.html?_r=0

I was interested in what options people chose, ad it helped me realize how we can manage to reduce the deficit through both budget cuts as well as tax increases, without compromising my values too much.

I chose:

1. Eliminate Farm Subsidies
2. Reduce military to pre-Iraq War size and further reduce troop sizes in Asia and Europe
3. Reduce the number of troops in Iraq an Afghanistan(outdated?)
4. Cap Medicare growth (also outdated)
5. Return to Clinton-era Estate Tax
6. Obama''s investment tax proposal
7. Allow Bush tax cut expiration for 250,000 and above incomes
8. Subject incomes at 106,000 or greater to payroll tax
9. Enact the millionaire's tax
10. Enact Carbon Tax
11. Enact Bowles-Simspon plan

However, this only addresses the deficit, and not the US debt as a whole. I am also aware some people think the NYTimes has a liberal bias so this one should make those people a little happier.

This one asks you to do more than just cut the deficit.

I:

1. Eliminated Iraq and Afghanistan war spending after 2021
2. Maintained the sequester
3. Replaced military personnel with civilians
4. Reduced social security spousal benefits
5. Include state and local workers in payroll tax
6. Established a public option in health exchanges
7. Modernized cost sharing
8. Bundled payments for Inpatient and Post-Acute Care
9. Introduced premium support to Medicare
10. Reduced Crop Insurance subsidies
11. Increased Excise taxes on alcohol
12. Enacted Carbon tax/Cap-and-trade
13. Imposed surtax on incomes above $1.5 million
14. Enacted the ""Buffet rule""
15. Improved Tax collection/cut tax loopholes
16. Raised Social Security Tax Cap to 90% of earnings
17. Included all new state and local workers into the payroll tax
18. Use the chained CPI
19. Reformed Fannie Mae and Freddi Mac
20. Imposed Financial Crisis Financial Responsibility Fee
21. Restored 2009 estate tax parameters
22. Eliminated LIFO and Gas & Oil preferences
 
I couldn't quite make the goal but did managed to reduce the debt to 60% of GDP by 2027, rather than 2024.
