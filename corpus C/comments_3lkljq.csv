Some of the most intelligent people I've known in my life would be complete idiots as leaders.  Some had an incredible depth of knowledge in a relatively small area, but a complete lack of common sense that makes them worthless as leaders.

Empathy is in the eyes of the beholder, too empathetic and our country is weak and powerless, a complete lack of empathy and we start WWIII.  

Problem solving skills are great, but what about the ability to convince others that the problems that you've solved are the right solutions for our country.  Being able to lead and convince others is far more than simply solving problems.  As President, you need the ability to see through B.S. and listen to people who have the right solutions, Presidents don't solve all of the problems, they listen, convince and implement.

cv73woe,1,t3_3lkljq,mrhymer,"Here is my idea for changing congress: 

Congress is broken by the internal rules they have created that ensures they only have to vote on measures that are not controversial to a majority of their constituents. If they do have to vote in a way that harms their election they get a big prize of money or contracts to take back home to offset the hits.

I propose that we pass a constitutional amendment to change congress in the following ways:

- Every member of congress can only propose one piece of legislation per year. That is two for congressman per term and six for senators per term. Each piece of legislation must be a one topic bill. No omnibus combined legislation. No amendments or poison pills added. No pork or anything else tacked on after the vote. No additions in committee before the bill is sent to the President.

- Every piece of legislation that is proposed gets a full vote in the body it was introduced. No exceptions. No killed in committee. No abstaining. Every elected person votes every time. If the legislation passes the first vote then the other body must also vote on the legislation.

- Every regulation passed by any department of the federal government that results in any kind of cost of compliance must be approved by both houses of congress and signed into effect by the President. Because we have such choking regulation now Each department can only propose one new regulation per session of congress. That is two per year. For every regulation that passes one must be ended.

- Everything expires. Every law, regulation, and amendment to the constitution that passes or has been passed before will expire every seven years from the date it went into effect.

- I would put in place citizen panel that would would determine if any legislation passed to the Presidents desk is constitutional. If it is not it goes back to congress for retooling and a new vote in the next session. The citizen panel would be picked new for each session of congress, chosen randomly like a jury and consist of 9 people. The citizen panel would be completely anonymous like a grand jury. The panel would move from state to state for each session and the governor of each state would be responsible for seating and instructing the members of the panel. A representative from each political party on the ballot in that state would silently observe the panel. The criteria for being on the citizen panel would be decided by each state legislature. The panel would ensure that all legislation is self-contained and easily readable by the average citizen.

The benefits of these changes to congress are many.

a. Citizens would vote for specific legislation instead of the looks or personality of the candidate.

b. There would be an automatic mechanism to halt the growth of government and get rid of obsolete regulations and laws.

c. Voters could see exactly where their representatives truly stood on every issue.

d. It would greatly reduce or even eliminate pork spending.

e. Lobbying would be less influential because the voters send the candidate with strong mandates and full transparency expected on the legislation they propose and the votes they cast.

f. The issues that truly matter to the people would get top priority over the agendas pushed by others.",1,0,1442686368,1444726522

This fails to take into account non-technocratic questions. What is a meritocratic position on Abortion? What is going to be a good score on 'economics' there are different factors that different people want emphasized. 

Further the criteria you use are inherently subjective. Empathy? I don't want or need my leaders to be empathic unless it happens to align with my own biases, because it's going to color decision making.

No, that's not really possible in a way that will satisfy all people, though it is scientifically possible. But that's not the centrepiece of the argument. 

In fact the point is that since we can't determine that metric, we set it aside and determine a logical outcome based on the remaining data;  since we know that abortion will occur regardless of it's legality, it follows that we should regulate it, the same way we should regulate drugs, prostitution, etc. And since abortion is the worst possible outcome of procreation, we should reduce it to as near a zero rate as possible by providing contraception and comprehensive sex education to the entire population.

Eventually technology will allow reproduction to be a completely separate process from sex, but that's a totally different discussion. 


> Just as most political questions aren't ones of 'well this is the right answer' 

I'd say probably 50% - 60% of political questions can be determined with a most correct answer; since many political issues represent questions of opportunity cost, of course this will always necessitate an answer that may be less beneficial to a particular group but if all groups are given equal weight (ie some groups do not curry favour with the government) then in theory we can almost always  provide the greatest benefit to the most people (or if you prefer the Vulcan method - the needs of the many outweigh the needs to the few)",1,0,1442712440,1444726522

Abortion being the worst possible outcome of procreation is a moral judgment on your part, one I do not agree with. Sex education and contraception are different issues. 

Technology separating having a kid with sex won't stop abortion from being an issue. To people who believe that fetus are alive you're asking them to vote for legalised murder. To people who believe it isn't alive you'd be forcing them to allow the existence of their child possibly against their will.
