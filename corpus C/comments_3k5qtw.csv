Wow, sensationalizing much? Its not that simple at all. Or rather, if we want to go that way, it is a question of if we want something to drive for us, or us to have the autonomy to drive ourselves. I do not believe that we should be forced to let someone else control the primary individual means of transportation. It is an issue of privacy and independence. Those cars will always be updating their position, and if you think for a second that isn't going to be tracked, logged, and used you are delusional.

No, it is not. Again the reddit echo chamber strikes. maybe *maybe* there wil be a few cars in the market in the next decade. Most people will be hesitant for a while at the very least. And plenty of people, like me will refuse flat out to have someone else take the control away from us.
