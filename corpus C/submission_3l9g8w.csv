3l9g8w,"Is there anyone among the governors or Congress that could be considered a ""moderate"" Bernie?",35,asimpleenigma,"From a political and campaign approach I love everything Bernie Sanders stands for. Refusing to whore himself out to big donors, being consistent and straightforward about his policies, willing to speak at venues with ideologically different attendees, the whole bit.

The issue is I don't agree with most of Sander's economic/socialist policies. So I'm hoping maybe somewhere out there exists a similar politician that is more moderate but has a similar approach to politics as Bernie. Maybe the rise of Bernie and in a way Donald Trump (egotistical asshole but he is a self funded candidate that doesn't tote the evangelical party line on many issues) will help encourage similar politicians to raise their profile.

The closest candidate I've actually seen to my personal beliefs is Jon Huntsman and he never had a shot in hell in getting the nomination.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l9g8w/is_there_anyone_among_the_governors_or_congress/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442462945,1444727707
