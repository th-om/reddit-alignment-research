Pharmaceutical companies do need to recoup the costs of their investments, and they recoup those costs on a global scale.  I'd have no problem with an international framework that got companies to beef up IP for pharmaceuticals but I doubt they'd go along with it, and Bernie tends to oppose things like the TPP that could conceivably do it anyway.  If we just unilaterally start controlling the price of pharmaceuticals it could hamper drug development.

And you didn't mention that Bernie opposes free trade, which is sort of amazing in 2015, and is very friendly towards immigrants that are already here, but not so much on immigrants that want to come here.

The Democrats have a master-plan this election and I am so grateful for it. They know that the policy/ideology differences within the Democratic party are miniscule compared to the great 'shut down the government'-level divide between the Democrats and the Republicans. After the last 6 years the Democrats know that political progress takes more than just the Presidency, [it takes a party](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/opinion/it-takes-a-party.html?_r=0).

So give the GOP have the spotlight and watch them implode! All their strength comes from attacking the Democrats, so give them nothing to base their attacks on. All they have is Benghazi/Obamacare and each other. Watch them beat each other to the ground. No matter who is left standing (lol Trump), the party is in total disarray.

If it hadn't been Hillary, the Democrats would have coalesced around another candidate. What better evidence of the strategy is there than the fact that the #2 spot is being securely held by a non-Democrat who has sworn not to run third-party and also sworn not to run a negative campaign? Elizabeth Warren would have been a better general election candidate, but she didn't run. Her run may have actually threatened Hillary/caused party infighting and nobody (including Warren/Sanders) wants that. Somebody has to be #2 to Hillary and Sanders is the perfect person to be it. He can bring up important issues, make overly idealistic/implausible proposals, and drum up enthusiasm for a more liberal Democratic party/candidate in the future.

For example the sky-rocketing cost of education problem he plans to solve by giving free education paid for by a tax on financial transactions. Two problems here: the fix for raising education costs won't come from shifting who pays for education but rather eliminating the incentives schools currently have to keep raising the price of admission. Second, a tax on every financial transaction raises the hurdle rate which means it's harder for capital to flow through the system. Projects that have a positive npv today won't happen tomorrow because the interest rate will change to account for the increased cost of financial transactions.

First of all, his fiscal policy is still a mystery and I'm pretty sure I won't like it when he does propose a tax plan. He's planning on increasing government spending by a lot through college and healthcare expenses and he has yet to propose a feasible way of paying for it. His proposed financial transactions and estate taxes won't take in nearly enough and are frankly just trying to push his narrative of taxing rich people. But you can't take in that much more revenue while just taxing rich people. The numbers just don't work out. If Bernie honestly proposed a tax plan that would pay for his planned expenses I may not like it, but at least I'd take him more seriously.

I don't respect his monetary policy at all. His advisors are modern monetary theorists, a sect of economists I consider not only dead wrong but dangerous. He's campaigned against the federal reserve.

I don't like the campaign finance reform talk because it means litmus-testing Supreme Court nominees, a practice I abhor.

As president he would be in charge of the federal reserve. **He has attempted to audit it in the past.** The federal reserve single-handedly controls the entire united states economy, and its policies benefits and drawbacks must emerge from an objective standpoint, not a subjective one, as most policy does. 

Thus, it is important to keep the fed in the hands of **actual economists**, because the point of a federal reserve is to be independent. His attempt at auditing the federal reserve worries me. My representative feels the same way about the fed, but unlike Bernie, he is in no position to do anything about it, and he has policies I like, whereas in Sanders case, he has a lot of control over it.

Trade. If he wants to disagree with 95% of economists on an issue, that is fine. He loses my support though. He has not only spoken out against the TPP, his arguments against the TPP are arguments against free trade in general, but they do not work. 

Also, he wants to raise corporate taxes. As a nation with one of the highest marginal corporate tax rates with small business bearing most of that, this is a very bad idea. It does not even generate much revenue.

Self defense isn't hunting, and doing it with a firearm involves either killing people or threatening to do so (which requires your gun be capable of being used for that).  So he is supporting bans on people owning guns for self defense.

If someone said ""I believe that we need to make sure that certain types of speech used to incite mistrust in government exclusively -- not for patriotism -- should not be allowed in the United States of America.""  Would it be a stretch to say they opposed your right to criticize the government?

I'll concede he needs to clarify what he meant because it doesn't make a lot of sense. He could be talking about assault rifles for all we know, which wouldn't ban all weapons for self-defense.

Your position appears to be that unless he *explicitly* says he wants to ban guns for self defense, we can't say he does.  But I'm pointing out that you wouldn't accept that argument in another context (where freedom of speech is involved, instead of the right to bear arms).

> In some states, but the Federal assault weapon ban expired ten years ago. 

Assault rifles are by definition machine guns under the national firearms act.  No new civilian machine guns can be created for the last several decades.

You conflate ""assault rifle"" with ""assault weapon"" (easy mistake to make, considering the term ""assault weapon"" is designed to cause that confusion), but ""assault weapon"" is a largely meaningless term.  Realistically, it means ""scary gun"", and nothing more.

> Again, I'm not defending what he said, but because I have no idea what ""guns used to kill people exclusively"" mean. 

They don't exist, at least not in any way that you could enforce a ban on.  The only guns used exclusively to kill people are those bought, used to commit a homicide, and then destroyed.  Anyone can see that, so Sanders is talking about something else, clearly.  Given this, and his clarification ""not for hunting"", it's clear he means firearms that isn't designed for hunting (or maybe competitive shooting) but rather to be used against humans.

Even accepting for a moment that Sander's is only talking about whatever ""assault weapons"" means this week, he's still in contradiction with the supreme court, because he said certain guns should be banned^1 *because* they are ""only used to kill people"" and not for hunting.  And since the supreme court has ruled that said rational isn't valid (at least in any sense that would be at all reasonable), ergo his position is in conflict conflicts with the SCotUS.

Then Obama was elected and many of those people thought ""Oh, ok, he'll take care of it, we can go back home."" And they did. Obama took the wind out of the sails for a lot of (in my view) necessary activism in the US by acting as a shock absorber for public anger at the status quo.
