What this means is that to see any noticeable amount of warming will take centuries and we will long run out of carbon fuels to even reach that amount of CO2 concentration in our atmosphere. The sea level rise will be incredibly slow (as no noticeable acceleration in sea level has been detected) which means any ""people"" affected by sea level rise will have decades if not centuries to relocate. There will be no ""Day after Tomorrow"" retarded weather events happening.

Plus how do you judge it when articles come out all the time that have polar opposite opinions on any issue.

Like [this one would call for the arrest of scientists who concluded that ocean levels were rising in the 20th century](http://www.jcronline.org/doi/pdf/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00157.1)

Or literally everyone from [Climategate which actually was purposely forged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy#Public_opinion_and_political_fallout)

The reason why a LOT of people don't trust scientists on this issue is because every couple of years, a major thrown around study gets proven false. Very few people disagree that climate change isn't happening (0 of the Republican presidential candidates denied it was changing) the question is how much is manmade and how fast.",1,0,1442705466,1444726870
cv7e0i6,0,t1_cv7dupo,selfabortion,"> Well depends on your definition of conspiracy

There are legal definitions of conspiracy that are used for prosecuting crimes all the time. I am not putting forth my own personal definition of conspiracy for the purpose of this particular issue.  As to the rest, there is more than enough scientific consensus that anthropogenic global warming is a fact.  Debates are only matters of degree. Republican politicians might not believe in it, but that is a different matter entirely.  Many claim not to believe in evolution, and that is the most robustly understood scientific framework we have and by any sane definition, evolution is a fact as well.

Your link about ""Climategate"" doesn't do anything to debunk the fact of anthropogenic global warming.",1,0,1442705790,1444726870

I know, which is why, as i have said countless times in this thread, no one is advocating for the arrest of anybody for having an opinion.  I am talking about actions, not opinions.  Conspiring is an action.  Conspiring for the purpose of suppressing information and profiting from it while harming public resources is also a set of actions, which can and should constitute actionable offenses.  The fact that anthropogenic global warming exists is a context that makes it an actionable offense. Whether or not it exists is not an opinion.  Like evolution and gravity, it is a fact that some people choose not to acknowledge or understand.

If this helps, think of the cigarette industry. It is scientific consensus that smoking is harmful to your health. There are surely people who have an opinion that disagrees. However, It is not legal for cigarette companies to create public ads that state they make your teeth sparkle and help you live to age 100. Some doofus at the cigarette company can have that personal opinion if he wants. It becomes a legal problem when they act in a way that goes against established scientific fact and harms the public while they profit from said misinformation. If multiple cigarette companies conspired to act in such a way that knowingly suppressed health information about their product, it can be a legal problem regardless of what the CEOs deeply held personal opinion is.",1,0,1442707636,1444726870
