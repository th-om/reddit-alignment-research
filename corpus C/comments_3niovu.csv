cvoh7zo,1,t3_3niovu,awa64,"""States' Rights"" has always been a bullshit argument, used as a loophole of last refuge to object to policy decisions that finally reached a high enough level of support to get enacted at the federal level. During the leadup to the Civil War, the South went from anti-States' Rights (because anti-slavery states were using their power as individual states to decline to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act) to pro-States' Rights overnight—specifically, the night Lincoln was elected without a single Southern state's support, showing they could no longer reliably win votes on slavery at the federal level. And then they went on to secede and write a new constitution... where states had fewer rights than they did under the Union.

Similar things happened with gay marriage—they were A-OK with DOMA existing at the federal level, barring the federal government from recognizing gay marriage regardless of whether or not a state recognized it, but as soon as DOMA was declared unconstitutional, conservatives started talking about how gay marriage should be decided at the state level instead.

If cities were their own states? If anything, they'd probably be more liberal. It's the density (and thus sense of community and collective identity), cultural diversity, and everyday visual access to the benefits of their government's spending that tends to, depending on your view of cause and effect, either turn city-dwellers liberal or draw liberals to cities. If cities were their own states, they wouldn't wind up subsidizing adjacent rural areas, letting them spend more of their money on infrastructure, public goods, cultural displays—essentially, it would let them focus more of their resources on the things city-dwellers tend to develop city pride over in the first place. I can't think of a reason that additional self-governance would make cities more conservative.",2,0,1444010121,1444718634

You're right, the Republican party is made up of five key constituencies: Religious extremists, bigots, anarchocapitalists, war hawks, and anti-intellectuals. I'm not sure how much I'd call it a ""coalition,"" though, considering how wide the overlap is between most of those groups—the only real disagreements seem to be between the anarchocapitalists and the war hawks.

I reject the idea that they're somehow unified in purpose as opposition to the Democrats, though. Only to the extent that the Democrats are already the party remaining for anyone who's not part of those five Republican constituencies.",1,0,1444151365,1444718634

- Lifestyle impacts political preference.
