I genuinely don't understand the rationale behind those on the left mocking Republicans for disagreeing with the Pope. Is there something in the Bible that say's Christians should be forced to agree with the Pope? Have Republicans tried to pass a bill saying everything the Pope says is absolute truth and should have an impact on government policy?
