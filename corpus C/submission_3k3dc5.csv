3k3dc5,"Under the Obama Administration, the federal government is currently ignoring standing laws with regard to the selling of marijuana. What if a Republican President chose to do the same, with regard to the selling of guns or with regard to abortion law?",56,zigmeister22,"Under current federal law, the selling of marijuana is illegal.  The Obama Administration, however, has instructed the federal government to ignore these laws, so federal agents (e.g. the FBI) are not currently raiding marijuana dispensaries and arresting the owners.  The result of this has been the wide-spread, public selling of marijuana in California, Colorado, and other states.

What if a Republican President chose to ignore standing federal laws too, with regard to the selling of guns, or with regard to abortion law?

Concerning my reference to federal abortion laws, this was just one example.  I will address your comments about it, however: 

With regard to abortion, what about the enforcement of the [federal FACE Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Access_to_Clinic_Entrances_Act) enacted by President Clinton?  
This group of federal laws make it illegal for protestors to form human chains, [like this](http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/newsroom/files/2014/11/Human-Chain-Poly-technique-commemoration-2014.jpg), that would interfere with someone attempting to enter a reproductive health building.

*Without getting too bogged down with regard to specific laws*, do we really want Presidents picking and choosing which standing federal laws should be enforced and which ones should be ignored?  




To me, this seems like a slippery slope that will become very dangerous.
