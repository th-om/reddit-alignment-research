Then you have to take into account of the religious conflicts between Sunnis and Shia which have cause more wars in that region that the Jewish vs Palestinians conflict ever has. Make no mistake about it the Islamic religion is far from being united and peaceful with respect to each other.

Egypt has little reasons to have Isreal stand alone especially now that the Syrians and Iranians have begun to work together militarily with the military might of Russia and China. Israel is an extremely powerful buffer state between Iran-Syria and Egypt. Even more so with Israel supported by the military might of the United States. Not saying they are all of a sudden going to become military allies with Israel but the way the political situation sets up right now in the Middle East, Israel is a nice deterrent to a southern expanse of Iranian power. Also the United States is already an ally of Egypt. The US is Egypt's major supplier of military hardware.

Saudi Arabia is already an ally of the United States. Once again the major supplier of military arms is the United States. They are currently fighting against Iranian power in the Middle East in Yemen. The Iranian and Saudi rivalry is a direct cause of the Yemeni War. 

You can't be an ally of Iran while being an ally of Egypt and Saudi Arabia. These nations are enemies in conflict over religion and power in this region. I wouldn't be surprised at all if we didn't start hearing reports of Egypt or Saudi Arabia arming the Kurds at some point in the future just to prevent Syrian and Iranian troops from crossing into Iraq.

By the way Israel has proved time after time that their military power is superior to anything the other Middle Eastern nations can bring to to the fight. Let us not forget that Israel once defeated the combined military power of Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and the Palestinians. Israel military is highly trained nuclear power with nuclear armed submarines. Its military training is so respected in the world that India has Israeli (not American or European) advisers to help train its military forces. Also its important to to note that India is an ally of the Israeli state. The largest military supplier of the Indian state is Israel. India launches all Israeli military satellites and the two nations even aid each other in joint weapons development projects. I bring India up for a simple reason. India is a very important Asian nation to counter China. The United States will not be willing to aggravate the Indian nation to begin a relationship with a enemy state of both India and its close ally Israel. To the United States, Asia is of more military importance than the Middle East is currently and India will play an important role.    ",1,0,1443843860,1444720071

The Absentee Property Law was the main legal instrument used by Israel to take possession of the land belonging to the internal and external Palestinian refugees, and Muslim Waqf properties across the state.

>and note that by using that comparison you're admitting that the Palestinians are victims of genocide

Absolutely not. I did not invoke that meaning for my analogy and you can't invoke it on my behalf. That's not how arguments work.

>Oh, despite that the *decendants* of those Natives sued and won many concessions nowdays for those past wrongs.

They're American citizens and can sue in American courts. Palestinians are foreign citizens of a foreign country. Regime change and war always create irreconcilable property shake-ups.

>And the reason why there are ""fewer"" of them with Israeli citizenship, is because the rest are forced to live in refugee camps

First of all, most of them don't live in refugee camps. They live in Palestine outside the camps. Second of all, Israel is a sovereign nation and it has the right to choose which countries it accepts immigrants from. If it doesn't accept Palestinian immigrants, that's their right.

And once again, this has nothing to do with democracy. All Israeli citizens can vote. That's universal suffrage. That's democracy. Poor treatment of Palestine, while reprehensible, is poor foreign policy, not lack of democracy.",1,0,1444236048,1444720075

First of all many people from Christian Zionits to American Jews do support Israel so there is a domestic component to our relationship with Israel.

Second of all we already do have good relations with Saudi Arabia and had good realtions with Egypt pre Sisi Coup.

> That doesn't invalidate that Iran wants to expand its influence in the region. 

What country doesn't want to ""expand influence"" anywhere, and why single out Iran? do you really think Israel doesn't want to ""expand its influence"" and that US-Iran getting along would not challenge Israeli ambitions? 

Iran's influence in the region has ultimately been for security and stability: Iran helped fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, fought against Saddam *when the US was backing him, much to their later regret* and is fighting jihadists in Syria as well as single-handedly keeping the West safe from a tsunami of drugs from Afghanistan and Pakistan. 

Iran will always be influential in the Mideast, simply because of its size, location, stature, history, culture, coastlines etc. Iran is a ""natural hegemon"" that has been there for 2000+ years, since long before Israel or the US even existed. That's just history

cvn8pu4,0,t1_cvn6gz7,ThreeCranes,"That's an interesting theory. Though Iran doesn't have a ""one China"" type policy for diplomatic relations.

>""[I]t wasn’t Iran that turned the Israeli-Iranian cold war warm – it was Israel . . . The Israeli reversal on Iran was partially motivated by the fear that its strategic importance would diminish significantly in the post-cold war middle east if the then president (1989-97) Hashemi Rafsanjani’s outreach to the Bush Sr
administration was successful.""

>Israeli politicians began painting the regime in Tehran as fanatical and irrational. Clearly, they maintained, finding an accommodation with such “mad mullahs” was a non-starter. Instead, they called on the US to classify Iran, along with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, as a rogue state that needed to be “contained.” http://williambowles.info/iran/iran_israel_strategy.html

Profs Walt and Mearsheimer noted in their famous book on the Israel Lobby

>Although it makes good strategic sense for the United States and Iran to pursue a grand bargain, and although there is plenty of suport for that policy inside and outside of America, it is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Israel and the lobby will almost certainly try to thwart any efforts to seriously engage Iran before they get started, as they have consistently done since 1993...If the United States does launch an attack, it wll be doing so in part on Israel's behalf, and the lobby will bear significant responsibility for having pushed this dangerous policy. And it would not be in America's national interest. http://www.amazon.com/Israel-Lobby-U-S-Foreign-Policy/dp/0374177724/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-0338796-7996150?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1191689739&sr=1-1",1,0,1443916812,1444720079
