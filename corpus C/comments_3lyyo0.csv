My standing is just that with a smaller de facto government (leaving the federal level to look more like the European Union) representation would become manageable from the point of view of citizens, journalist, and smaller political organizations. 

It would also allow more focus on more regional issues as well as governing systems. (I suspect the south would prefer fewer elections compared to the New England area.)",1,0,1442949058,1444725274

wow that's a weird feeling. Personally I'd like to see myself as more independent than anything else but people usually call me far left in the American political spectrum

Redrawing the states might not be a bad idea in principle, but I'm glad you recognize that it's politically impossible.  I really like the 38 state model myself.  


>allocating power from the Federal government in to the State governments 

What do you think states should be in control of that they aren't already?  Pretty much everything legislated at the federal level has a very good reason to be.  Do you think the states should be in control of their own civil rights?  Can each state set it's own immigration policy?  Can the new states conduct foreign diplomacy?

>a la The European Union but less

Seems to me that the EU is doomed to failure unless it becomes more like the US.  How would your new America avoid problems like the Greek Debt Crisis or their game of refugee hot potato?

Drug legislation, certain crimes I believe would fare better under state than federal (i.e. readjust min. sentencing), same sex marriage is contested, so is lot of other internal issues.

I believe it would be akin to those monarchies where countries have different internal regulations but share foreign policy

cvami4h,0,t1_cvaljp2,_PM_ME_YOUR_SMILE,">Drug legislation

Okay, I kind of agree with this one.  On the other hand, one state with liberal drug laws makes it almost impossible for adjacent states to have restrictive drug laws.  

>readjust min. sentencing

This is already a state issue.  

>same sex marriage

This *was* a state issue, but huge public outcry led to a change at the federal level.  If you don't think this is a good thing, consider that this is also how the civil rights act happened.  

>I believe it would be akin to those monarchies where countries have different internal regulations but share foreign policy

Empires tend to have very short lifespans.  Look at the USSR or Yugoslavia for what happens when you don't have a cohesive national identity

But isn't that a problem we have now, on a global level? The economy is globalizing faster than the governments can keep up. At this point drug policies are more of a reactive response than anything else. 

>this is also how the civil rights act happened.

You make a very good point and I'm not keen on the idea of letting loose the > less open minded < on social issues.

*but* 

at the same time can we truly regulate morality? That concept just doesn't seem align to the principals of a democratic secular government for me... despite the fact that I recognize the times the supreme court were really the crucial point in moving forward as a country....

uhh I was really referring more to the Dutch and Danish monarchies
