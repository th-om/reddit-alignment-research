I am essentially a reproductive-rights absolutist: I believe that a woman's right to bodily autonomy absolutely trumps any ""rights"" of a fetus or any governmental/societal interest in that fetus. Accordingly, I think abortion should be legal under more-or-less any circumstances (acknowledging run-of-the-mill professional licensing and other regulations that affect medical practice generally).

That said, I have no ironclad scientific basis for holding that view; I can appeal to no irrefutable, universal moral principle. Intelligent, ethical, reasonable people believe differently -- and that should be respected. People who believe that abortion constitutes murder should not be obligated to subsidize the practice with their tax dollars.

Put another way, I'm all in favor of abortion rights . . . but maybe I'm wrong. In any event, there's no way to *prove* -- to myself or to others -- that I'm right. I can support abortion rights *and* (ready your downvotes) empathize with those who want Planned Parenthood defunded.

I think the best way to solve, or at least work towards solving, the problems with the Cartels has nothing to do with a fence or border security in general.

These revenue streams from harder drugs are much more inconsistent due to the fact that far less people use hard drugs than weed. They also are more expensive to produce because they need ingredients from elsewhere whereas weed production is completely in house.

It is much harder for cartels to pay for daily expenses like bribes with an inconsistent revenue stream from harder drugs. It could be done I guess but it would shrink the demand for illegal drugs which would, in theory, shrink the number of cartels and their influence.

>Is marijuana really their primary cash crop?

I've heard described like this: Weed is the paycheck that cartels get every other week that keeps that lights on and drugs like meth or cocaine are the bonuses that make them rich.

2) your perspective is simplistic and fails to take the big picture into consideration. We have a system where everyone works for themselves...but this system leads to a lot of people being left out. People have to work harder than they would otherwise, competing with others in said system to survive. Poor people run over each other out of desperation to acquire jobs that pay poorly by rich people who don't give a ****. Since the number of people will always outnumber the number of jobs in a functioning capitalist society, labor's power is detoothed and people are forced to compete in a rigged game that dehumanized and commoditizes them. Above that, not being able to find work is a death sentence as they have no legitimate means to survive. What kind of society punishes people for there not being enough work available? What kind of society requires more work to constantly be created to allow more people to prosper? You mentioned basic morality,but now I'm gonna appeal to common freaking sense.

Your ""moral"" arguments assume a lot of assumptions that I don't assume. They assume an absolute system of property to rights. They assume you are entitled to 100% of your money that you worked for in this system. I don't accept that. Nor do I accept the abolishment of private property as communists do. I accept a compromise. I accept that property rights should be flexible rather than sacrosanct. That it is good to override them if a case can be made that it leads to a greater good. Giving people rewards for labor is a necessary incentive to get people to work. Sure. But we can do without the threat of material deprivation if they don't. As such, everyone should get a minimal basic standard of living, and if people want more, and most people probably will, they can work for it. If we transition into an economy based on automation, the idea can be expanded, whereas automation is the death knell of your system.

Capitalism has both good and bad aspects to it. It has a lot of weaknesses, but it also has strengths. I say we use the strengths and seek to compensate for the weaknesses, and ubi is the best program to do that.

As I said, your idea is simplistic and fails to see the big picture. It makes people have to work harder and harder through the threat of material deprivation if they don't, has societal dysfunction naked into it, and is ultimately very selfish. You can say what you want of those who want what you consider the fruits of other's labor, but a system like I'm proposing would make most people better off, even the workers. Its only the rich who have to fear from it, and they have too big of a share of the wealth if the goal is wealth is to maximize happiness and well being. As far as I'm concerned, as a utilitarian, the goal of all morality is to maximize happiness and well being. All morality to come after that must accomplish that goal. As such, property rights themselves are only moral if they maximize happiness and well being. And they do....but not when applied absolutely. Only when applied in the manner I describe.

I dont mind if people come here legally and try to assimilate, but illegal immigration, while not AS problematic as conservatives portray it as (definitely not a DEY TUK R JERBS kinda guy), I am concerned about assimilation. I mean, I""ve seen a tendency among some liberals to move toward bilingualism, and when i challenge the concept, I normally get stuff about latin america and how this is the way the world is going and blah blah blah. Sometimes the talking points on immigration arent convincing. You cant say that on the one hand they assimilate but on the other hand we have to adapt to their presence. No.

And if I were European, I'd been deeply concerned about all those muslim refugees. I can understand wanting to be humanitarian, but then I see stuff like that the refugees were trying to get octoberfest in germany shut down because it's unislamic? Screw that. If that's your attitude go the heck home.

I'm very much a big believer in the whole ""my turf my rules"" sorta thing. I'm nowhere near as xenophobic as a lot of the right is. I'm not for mass deportation, I'm not for keeping immigrants out, but if you're gonna come, respect our culture, respect our rules, respect our way of life, and dont expect us to adapt to you. You're a guest in OUR country. Do things OUR way or get out.

I also think birthright citizenship is highly problematic and while I support the concept for children of those who are legal residents, I think the children of two illegal immigrants should be not given US citizenship. Seems like a bad loophole, and it would be a possible exploit if we were to implement my kind of social programs in the US like basic income.

Ever notice how left wing welfare states in Europe are also highly critical of immigration? That's basically the kind of liberal I am. Left wing politics combined with a lax approach to immigration is a very uniquely american position in terms of the political spectrum as far as I know. And it's basically because the modern republican party has a deeply racist/xenophobic history going back to the 1960s with the signing of the civil rights act, the exodus of the south from the democratic party, the southern strategy, etc. Because the right sopped up all the racist/xenophobic types, the left becomes the party of pro immigration. In many other countries, left wingers dont think much differently than me.

It should be noted I still consider myself relatively moderate though on immigration. I'm not for mass deportations, as I said, I dont think they have a particularly harmful impact on the economy. I'm mainly concerned with cultural conflicts and lack of assimilation, as well as problems they might pose for the welfare state (our current system doesnt give stuff to illegals, but I'm for a basic income, which means we need to pay special attention to immigration as to not just give free money to people who come here illegally). 

-----

I'd also say I'm somewhat moderate on guns as well. I tend to lean toward the democratic arguments nowadays since our gun violence problem is out of control and we have so many mass shootings and all, but I also understand the second amendment and believe in states rights in governing this issue, since federal legislation doesnt make sense outside of the most basic stuff like no freaking automatic assult rifles, need background checks, etc. Anything beyond the most basic stuff should be handled locally.

No taxes other than regular sales tax, no fees, no hoops to jump through, no arbitrary restrictions on models or accessories, and the only way to lose your right to bear arms is to be convicted of a felony.",1,0,1443301628,1444723658
cvfqndw,1,t3_3mdze4,sillyhatday,"Ideologically I'm a mosaic of liberalism, progressivism, libertarianism, and a dash of socialism. There isn't really any conservative current to my thinking. Even on spot issues where I agree with the republicans more it's because they have the more permissive(liberal) stance(guns), or I concede their idea is technically superior(trade).

But that said, in many ways I'm a political republican. That is to say that as for our democratic republic, I favor a little more republican format. The reason is because while I believe the public should have absolute choice over who represents them, they shouldn't be making policy decisions. The lay public can be majoratarian and fantastically incorrect about basic things. I get annoyed when I go to vote in a local election and there is a question on there about routing a water main. I don't know; I'm not a competent authority on this. Ask a hydrologist. ",1,0,1443359696,1444723658

And things like climate change, I'd rather have an inefficient Democratic solution than no solution at all. Healthcare is the same way, Obamacare got a lot of things fixed where as Republicans just didn't really want to do anything.

And also Democrats are much better at foreign policy IMO. I'm not into the whole dick measuring contest with Russia and I think the Iran deal is good.
