>OBAMA: US ACTION WOULD SEND ASSAD 'STRONG SIGNAL'

Inaction turned out to be the signal we sent. But he was right about it being a ""strong Signal""...

We sent more signals when we bombed the shit out of Libya for all of 2011 until Gaddafi's government was destroyed... and then did nothing to help restore order there. We claimed we were doing it to help civilians, but how was it helpful to fill that country with guns and then abandon it to the untrained and unaccountable militias that we armed? We continued that game over in Syria, with the same results.

President Obama loves to brag about how much money his foreign policy has saved the US when compared to Iraq.

But what has that savings bought us? When Bush left office he handed a peaceful middle east off to Obama, and today it looks like a Mad Max movie in some parts, WWIII in others.

What can we expect? We can expect Russia to try to help Assad by driving the PKK into Turkey and ISIS and Al Nursa and AQ affiliates into Iraq. Syria will have another ""election"" where Assad gets 90% of the vote... just like the last one... We can expect Russia to do what most western liberals do - use word for word the same argunments about how the US is all at fault, point to The Iraq War which ended 8 years ago and say it is proof of US and Western failure. Russia can brag about how they come to the aid of their allies. And russia has more power in the region that it ever dreamed of before the ""end"" of the cold war.

I'm also willing to bet that the US and the coalition will no longer be trying to bomb targets in Syria - too afraid of a showdown with a Russian jet.

Iran is more than willing to help their hezbollah brothers in Syria march down into Iraq and try to advance the Sunni cause there... They too are more than happy to help prove out the ""IRAQ WAS A FAILURE"" meme...

And after a hard fought war from 02-07, and relative peace from 08-14 - Iraq will have no choice but to turn to Iran. Where is another option for them?

The 13 year old democracy that is Iraq was challenged by ISIS. There is no way they can stand up to Russia, Syria and Iran.

And the next leader of the free world... will inherit all of this from President Obama's foreign policies.

What is the next step from there? the only thing that seems certain is more safehavens for terrorism and more instability in a middle east that could have been stable, if only the west had a leader who could articulate why responsible action is needed.

Unfortunately for the west - all we have are politicians and their pollsters who are too afraid to get the same treatment Bush and Blair got for preaching responsible actions and the promotion of Democracy in the region.",0,0,1443742030,1444720957
