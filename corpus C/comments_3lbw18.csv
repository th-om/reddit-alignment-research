cv50dtb,0,t1_cv4zp3s,PoppyOncrack,"That's true, but his record prior to his presidential campaign(s) was fairly solid, and solidly moderate as well. That's probably why he flip-flopped on so many issues in 2012.",1,0,1442517321,1444727362
cv50xql,0,t1_cv50dtb,CaspianX2,"He really wasn't as moderate as you think. While Governor of Massachusetts, he had [844 vetoes](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/06/us/politics/romney-claims-of-bipartisanship-as-governor-face-challenge.html?ref=politics&_r=1) of the Democratic legislature's bills (most of which were then overridden). He clearly butted heads with Democrats in an *extreme* way.

His record as governor wasn't all that great, either. [Massachusetts' debt level rose](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/spending_chart_1992_2015MAp_H0c%22), despite having no recession to contend with, he only managed not to raise new taxes by [leveraging thousands of new fees](http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/romney/Download-the-entire-list-of-fees-Romney-raised-v2), the highest yearly GDP growth during his term was [1.86%](http://www.bea.gov/regional/bearfacts/action.cfm) (under the 2% he criticized Obama for), and he left office with a [59% disapproval rating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorship_of_Mitt_Romney#Job_approval_ratings_as_governor).

His one *actual* accomplishment, Romneycare, something [he once applauded Obama bringing to the entire nation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PnbGuEe4ug), was a position that he completely flip-flopped and ran counter to during the presidential election.

Romney was a poor governor, and he would have made a terrible president.",0,0,1442518139,1444727362
cv51cx4,0,t1_cv50xql,PoppyOncrack,"I agree he would have made a terrible POTUS, but i still think he was more moderate than you're saying, as Governor he supported Gay Rights, he was pro-choice, supported Immigration reform,was for minor gun control,etc...
