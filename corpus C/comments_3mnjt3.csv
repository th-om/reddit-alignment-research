Everyone knows it won't necessarily stop people crossing the border and that most immigrants don't even enter by coming over that border. It's not the goddamn point. It's about surrounding your nation with a nice wall, because you can and you deserve it. We should do one to the north too. 

Deportation numbers are artificially up because the administration changed the definition. Mexico is not explicitly sending criminals of all varieties (including rapists), but they have far less enthusiasm about trying to get undesirables to stay than people that would be useful in Mexico, so the net effect is a higher percentage of those people leaving Mexico. This should be common sense, and Mexico has also admitted it. Trump obviously knows they are not all rapists, and it really seems like people are more concerned about reminding us about that statement and keeping it in the public eye than anything. Somehow that seems more damaging to race relations. How about this, if the statement were bad enough it would have ruined him. It didn't ruin him, so as much as you don't like it, there's really no sense in reminding everyone about it. Don't try to force people's opinions on things.
