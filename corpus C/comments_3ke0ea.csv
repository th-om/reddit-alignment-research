I think an alternative explanation for their finding is that schooling might exhibit diminishing returns. I think the stratification could mask that.

If we could look at this by year and not by group, it could shed light on that dynamic. I skimmed the last few pages, so I apologize if they address this.

As a group, No.  A college in rural Iowa is likely to attract a great number of people with a primary interest in agriculture.  They would value a program that leans heavily toward organic chemistry and biochemistry.  In Southern California the focus is likely to more toward inorganic chemistry.

Perhaps in your community that's what most people want out of a community college.  In other communities people really are looking for that two year degree.
