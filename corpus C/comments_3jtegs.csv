Hillary, in fairness or not, promotes a visceral response to a lot of people. A lot of people love her, a lot hate her.

I'm thinking that it's less about ideology (which may evolve for justifiable reasons) than it is about monopolizing publicity.

A candidate that can harness this level of press coverage, regardless of the quality of it, becomes naturally comparable to an actual sitting president.

This really is the only way to justify Trump's sustained rise in the GOP.  It's a different way of politicking, but it's arguable that it's not only effective, but is actually what matters.  It's also what separates him from candidates like Herman Cain and is what makes him more relatable to a Perot candidacy...Perot also commanded a lot of media attention.

It's not a misstep.  He's said all along that he would only sign that pledge if he was confident he'd win the GOP nomination.  It's difficult to argue against that notion now.

Does anyone in the world actually believe her bullshit excuse for running her private email server? She is an spoiled brat and a liar - two qualities I will never support for president nor any other elected office. ",0,0,1441614980,1444732268
cusghn4,1,t3_3jtegs,sillyhatday,"I think she isn't taking this email thing seriously enough. I would have lost my clearance for stuff like that without question. It's a real scandal. That said, it's a scandal about infosec compliance which the public doesn't care about. It's not unethical or anything. Admit to being too cavalier with information, comply with the process, and let everything get said. It's still very early, so there is ample time to move on. But she also needs to be taking Bernie Sanders seriously. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he will never be president, but HRC can't act like that is a given. She did that last time and Obama made her pay for it. He happens to be the class of his generation at electoral politics, which Bernie is not. But taking your opponent lightly is always foolhardy. If you're so much better, show it. Make him look like the afterthought you think he is. I can beat the best fighter in the world if he doesn't fight back. The HRC camp clearly thinks the SEC primary will save her, and I agree it will be hard for her to lose there. But why get beat up in IA and NH if you don't have to. She has the money and the means. If you have this unstoppable machine, go out and be unstoppable. Also, IA and NH are far more decisive states in an election than GA and SC are. A Democrat losing GA and SC is no news in a general election. If one lost NH and IA I would be worried. I support HRC, but all she's ever shown in presidential elections thus far is fantastic underachievement. She'd better change that pretty quickly if she doesn't want to become our William Bryan--the person who was always supposed to be president, but never was. ",0,0,1441548218,1444732268

I've worked in the intelligence community (IC) too and I know what you mean because that's my personal experience too.  I think the server was a ridiculous security risk for a public servant with access to classified to have, but it's not like she tried to hide this server or anything...everyone knew about it for years.

The thing is, most people in the IC don't speak to the public, at all, about their jobs, and do almost all of their work in secured areas like SCIFs.  That simply does not describe anything close to Clinton's operating environment, and I would think that for public officials like herself the bar for accidental disclosure of classified is much lower.  That still does not justify having a fucking server for official business, but it does make it far more understandable why people like her may be caught with their pants down if they ever underwent an audit.  I mean, I'm almost certain that any congressperson with access to classified who had to turn over their email would be guilty of the same ""offenses"" that Clinton has been known to commit regarding classified.

Yeah, this is pretty much where I stand too, cheers.",1,0,1441549103,1444732268
