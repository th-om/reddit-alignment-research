We've got the convenient natural wall of the ocean and it isn't working, but people want to spend an absurd amount of money building a giant wall as though that's somehow insurmountable. It's one of the most flagrant examples of ""doing something just for the sake of doing something"" I've ever seen. ",5,0,1442454783,1444727776

cv48t8t,1,t3_3l8yj1,shelfdog,"In a word, No. I believe it is an impossibility based on the sheer length of the border we'd be looking to secure as well as the astronomical price not just of constructing an 1,954 mile wall, but the infrastructure to electrify it, the upkeep of the wall and electrical components and the manpower to do the above as well as patrol it. 

As of now, the US controls around 700 miles of the border with a wall or fence, with only 130 miles or so of that acknowledged they can practically prevent entry. Too many miles, too few BP Agents or money to hire more.

Having visited the existing wall from the US side for a film project with the Border Patrol, I gotta tell you, the border is immense and far longer than you might think. The walls and fences are in disrepair, have gaping holes and generally are just an eyesore. Even where the walls were, just a few miles away, a quick swim across a river and you are in, or a quick walk across a field where the fence was 4 feet high and jumpable. 

In my mind, we lack the cash, the desire, the infrastructure and the manpower to do it. Few would vote to spend the money it would take to build an electrified wall over spending it on housing, highways, healthcare, etc. That's my 2 cents.",3,0,1442455502,1444727779

When all you have to do is enforce the labor laws that are already in effect. 

They are coming here for work. 

If you dry up the work by making AMERICANS follow the law about who they are hiring then the work dries up and they go home because there is no point in staying. ",2,0,1442500980,1444727787

Plus what about the animals that naturally cross there, you going to fuck up their life too? If you are so worried about it just double the amount of border agents and give them more dollars to buy drones and other equipment. Though I'm sure it makes sense to have a fence in certain areas.
