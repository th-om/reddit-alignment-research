> So when they promise us they won't use their nuclear program to develop weapons do you think we can take their word for it?

No, that's why the entire deal is about inspecting their nuclear facilities. Where in the deal do you see anything that requires we take Iran's word on something?

>(The inspection period is essentially useless (over 24 days)

Are you aware of how long it takes for radioactivity to decay? A hell of a lot longer than 24 days. Also, that is the maximum amount Iran can delay, and only for military sites that the U.S. doesnt currently think there is any nuclear activity in. Inspectors will have access to known nuclear sites more or less constantly.

How does the deal make this more likely as opposed to less likely than if there was no deal? There are specific consequences for Iran's violation worked into the deal, that would be absent given no deal. The U.S. has no less leeway to respond militarily if that's what it takes.

I agree there will most likely be bumps in the road but if we get to the point where Iran breaks the deal, the U.S. will have strong international support for any type intervention.
