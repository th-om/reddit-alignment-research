3kqyil,What do you all think of Chris Hedges?,14,CUNTstandinople,"Chris Hedges, the American journalist, activist and author. I read an article he wrote recently entitled The Great Unravelling, where he addresses America and the ever growing problem of neo-liberalism. It spoke to me, but I found his use of emotional language somewhat off-putting. He comes off as extreme in his views, but a lot of what he says about the illusion of a two-party system, laissez faire capitalism, and oligarchical America speaks to me.
