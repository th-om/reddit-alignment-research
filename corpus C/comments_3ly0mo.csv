All joking aside I really have no idea.  At best it should go toward endorsing a politcal candidate for office.   ",0,0,1442964490,1444725439

It is almost certain that some of the money donated was a result of him redirecting $400 million from funding University of Wisconsin to paying for the Milwaukee Buck's new stadium. He announced president candidacy about a week after pushing that through. Not a coincidence.

He's likely got blood money in there, so returning it just means more blood will be spilled by other candidates.

Maybe he donates the money back to UW as an apology.",-1,0,1442948416,1444725439
