This is the bigger policy concern: our nation's biggest agricultural producing state is a fucking desert. There are plenty of other sun-belt states with warm weather - that are *not* deserts - that could support California's burden of agriculture. 

The smartest play to solve California's water crisis is to move agricultural production to Texas, Florida, and so forth.

No.  As stated repeatedly, most of the water used is for agriculture.  

Further, from the standpoint of water conservation, we are not necessarily growing the 'right' things; growing almonds, or cows for that matter, costs a lot more water than growing potatoes or chickens.  It might make economical sense for an individual farmer to grow almonds instead of potatoes, but as a global practice it uses a lot more water.  In general, I think you'd find more Democrats than Republicans in favor of centralized planning to that end, but only in theory and it would never get anywhere legislatively.
