From where I'm standing? The long-term trend looks to me like one where it's ever more difficult to move public opinion with money alone. The cost of votes is going up, fast, and old dinosaurs who only know how to play their one old game are throwing ever greater sums around in a vain effort to maintain the same level of control that their pappies and their grand-pappies enjoyed. Rupert Murdoch wishes he was William Randolph Hearst. But those days are gone. Three networks have become three million. There will never be another Walter Cronkite.


Has Donald Trump even spent any money? I know Bernie hasn't. It's all about the word-of-mouth these days, it's about what's trending, what's viral. What does money actually buy? Issue ads on television that get TiVo'd through anyway? Today? You're almost as likely to spur people to think the opposite of what you want them to believe if you plaster the airwaves with too many issue ads. Americans are the marketing people. We're salesmen ourselves. We know the tricks.


Money is only worth the votes that it buys. The power still lies in the ballot-box. I'm not against listening to some rich guys opinions on how things should change, or the guy next to me on the bar-stool, or even one of you clowns. Anybody is free to try to change my mind.

Also, get-out-the-vote spending doesn't compete directly with the other sides. However much you spend? The cost of moving my turn-out up 10% stays the same. You may spend twice what I spend to move your turnout from 30 to 60, vrs. my 30 to 50. So if the actual ideological split is 40-60? The 40 ain't buying the win.

Actually that's the very point. There's so much at stake with those tax dollars is *why* there's such a huge incentive to capture that power for yourself.

And no, the US isn't unique in allowing money in politics. Many developed countries don't have limits on contributions or spending, but we don't see the same corruption.

> Do super PACs have to disclose the sources of their funding?
That depends on what you mean by ""disclose."" Like other political action committees, super PACs do have to file regular financial disclosure forms with the Federal Election Commission. But because they are permitted to accept money from incorporated entities that do not have to make the sources of their funding public, it's possible for them to keep the names of actual donors undisclosed. In 2010, a super PAC that was active in one of that year's marquee House races listed a single donor: a 501(c)(4) organization that does not have to disclose its donors. This is what is known among some campaign finance lawyers as ""the Russian doll problem.""

The FEC.

Actually they don't have to disclose their donors *if* the funds are not earmarked for specific things. If they are, such as spending on this person or that person, or generating this or that kind of media, they do.

Of course SuperPacs are only allowed to accept corporate/union donations or individual donations greater than 5K if the funds are not spent on a candidate's campaign, including coordinating with a candidate in generating media.

Now you might say ""yeah but [making that illegal] hasn't/won't stop it, but then what makes you think making it more illegal will? ",1,0,1441685162,1444731854
cuue5um,0,t1_cuu3yb7,AlecBergHouseman,"Just saying ""The FEC"" is not actually sourcing your claim. Where did they release these statistics? Based on the laws governing donations to SuperPACs, I contend there is no way to actually break down the percentages in the manner you proposed. 

The second part of your response, forgive me, doesn't make much sense. I just don't quite understand you are trying to say or what point you're trying to make.

Please focus on the initial question I asked: How can you get a percentage breakdown like you claimed when SuperPACs are not required to disclose their donors?

I'm explaining how they actually work, and the conditions required for funds to be in a superpac, and who has to disclose their identity.



>How can you get a percentage breakdown like you claimed when SuperPACs are not required to disclose their donors? 

Because only non-profits aren't required and only if they don't earmark any funding. Everyone else does.",1,0,1441729185,1444731854

With massive donations coming in to individual politicians, those who donate are granted significant influence over the legislative process in our country.  This means that our politicians are beholden not to the citizens they represent, but rather those who write them checks.  

Thats the theme of the OP, at least in the beginning part.  And this is what the term ""money in politics"" refers to.  You're way off.

Let's wait another decade as world economies crumble because of their govt largess. Then get back to me and argue the same point!

Ignorance is bliss, eh!


>Further, I'd suggest that at least part of the reason for this is that the money they get causes them to place their focuses elsewhere. Essentially, they don't work for us anymore, they work for the people who pay them, just like everybody else.

That's not how it's supposed to be. In fact, they are not supposed to work for us by giving us stuff. Their job is to actually work less than they are now and keep us freer from them and ourselves.


But then again I like liberty and freedom. People that selfishly think the govt and their neighbors owe them stuff would disagree with me.

We were not competing for jobs with China & India. 

We had little to no personal debt.

We had no college debt.

We had real money and not trading with instruments of debt.

I am suggesting nothing of the sort.

We're not coming out of a war and rebuilding the rest of the world.

You are right but no longer on a world that exists.

Also, if you get right down to it, we probably have double to triple the govt meddling as we did back then. And it's easy to prove. just look at how the govt works full time at adding new laws and regulations every day.


Obamacare, on it's own, was over a thousand pages long!

You also have pages of environmental and employee regulation you have to follow.

Then there is the added state an local bureaucracies you have to fight.

Employers must provide insurance because of govt mandate.

Sorry, but you actually lose. In no way can you show we have less regulations and laws than we had in the past.

GO ahead and try. I'll add the new regulations that are added unconstitutionally by govt departments too.",1,0,1441670623,1444731854
