cv53rq5,1,t3_3lcece,zigmeister22,"It's not just ""evil companies"" doing it:

A 2012 Gallop poll found that [only 41% of Democrats polled supported expanding the use of nuclear power for electricity generation](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/06/05/1097574/-Nuclear-Power-and-Public-Opinion-What-the-polls-say#).  

The fact is that wind and solar are not base load sources of electricity generation.  Base load sources are ones that can provide electricity at any time.  The only sources of base load electricity generation we currently have are coal, natural gas, nuclear and hydro.  

The fact is, Democrats are against the expansion of the only carbon-free sources of base load electricity generation that we have (the last two).",3,0,1442522379,1444727332

> Among the renewable energy sources,hydroelectric, geothermal,[5] biogas, biomass,solar thermal with storage and ocean thermal energy conversion can provide base load power. A significant fraction of the averagewind power production is available with 95% or greater probability, and so may be used for baseload power.

I see solar there. ",1,0,1442523506,1444727332
cv56g56,0,t1_cv54i4k,zigmeister22,"You're correct about some renewables being baseload-class, but the issue with these is energy output.  For example, all of the electricity provided by all of the photovoltaic solar panels in the entire United States currently sits at about 6,200 megawatts per day.

The Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona, however, generates about 4000 megawatts per day.  So 1.5 of these nuclear reactors vs. *every solar panel in the entire United States*.

I am not against wind and solar, in fact I support them 100%.  I just know that we've got to have reliable, carbon-free base load sources too and this just leave nuclear and hydro.  Democrats don't want to expand either of these.

We have massive demand for electricity and this demand will only grow as we move to electric vehicles, etc.  We have to have reliable sources of large amounts of electricity for our economy to be able to grow.

honestly? by actually experiencing the start of the effects of catastrophic climate change. could happen in 10 years or 100 years. but i think that is what it will take before we take action. hopefully, by that time, technology has advanced to a point where we can take immediate action. 

climate change is a very complex scientific issue. in america, it helps to simplify things to an either or scenario (yes/no, good/bad, etc.). that is very difficult to do, even with the world's smartest scientists who dedicate their lives to this. 

i highly doubt this country will organically begin to act on climate change by electing in leaders who will pass laws. i have a feeling we will already be experiencing the effects by that time.

please tell me i'll be wrong. please.",1,0,1442521737,1444727337
