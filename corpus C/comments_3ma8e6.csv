By paying private doctors through mechanisms that hide the price from the customers (insurance and Medicare) it allows for various types of actions on the service end that increase costs.  

This is seen mostly through hospital paymaster systems, where a patient comes in to get a treatment, maybe pays a standard co-pay, and then the hospital inflates the costs of every service to get *maximum* profit from the service from the insurer.  This is the reason uninsured people often get bills for tens of thousands of dollars.  The paymaster system, not knowing which procedure will be reimbursed by the insurer, sends a standard inflated bill to the insurer, which is then corrected by the insurer and returned to the hospital which discounts several thousand dollars.  They do this because Medicare might reimburse for pneumonia, but not for a hospital admission...where another insurer will reimburse for the hospital admission, but not for the specific treatment.

We also have high regulatory  costs for entering the field.  A doctor nowadays has to go in the hole hundreds of thousands of dollars before they can practice.

>Would that be included in the study on unnecessary healthcare spending I linked?

I don't believe so, I'm not sure, but this seems to fall outside the categories of ordering unnecessary procedures, missed prevention, fraud, excessive administration, inefficient delivery, and excessive prices that is covered by that article.

They do, that's why the costs get written down.  But the insurance companies must negotiate against those inflated costs to begin with and they'll always be paying the maximum cost for the procedure, never less.  That's why we've seen some insurance shifting to favor out-patient centers to bring costs down.  

There's also some aspect of price gouging from hospital personnel.  Nurses will sign charts because they looked at the chart and that entitles them to send a bill.  I saw this when my children were born and we had bills from 10-12 nurses, but had only ever seen about 3-4.

Hospital Stay: $5,000

Nursing Services: $400

>Wouldn't the same problem exist without the 3rd party payer insurance model? Wouldn't consumers still be negotiating from a very high starting price?

Not if they're paying cash.  If you pay cash and ask for billing up front, you'll get more of a true cost bill (as I understand it).

Also, just to clarify, I didn't advocate for any particular system.  I'm just explaining some of the things going on in our current healthcare marketplace.  I don't think insurance is bad by itself, it's just been manipulated into a position it's not adequate for covering.    In my opinion, insurance is good for the unknowns, it's not good for a standard care mechanism.

cvddir1,1,t3_3ma8e6,iflyboats,"The following isn't the ""conservative"" explanation, but it's the *correct* explanation:

1. Even before ObamaCare, more than half of of U.S. health care spending was government spending through Medicaid and Medicare, which led to an incredible rise in demand for medical services, and along with it, an incredible rise in healthcare costs. 

2. The Federal tax code, which steers people into purchasing health insurance through an employer, drives an extreme overuse of insurance and encourages irresponsible behavior on both the parts of patients and doctors by insulating consumers from medical expenses that they should be paying out-of-pocket. As a result, we demand more insurance and use more medical services than we otherwise would. It's completely irrational that we would pay for common medical treatments through insurance, which by nature is designed to protect against the unexpected.

3. FDA regulation drives an astronomical increase in the costs of drugs and medical devices by 1) creating huge compliance expenses that manufacturers must defray by increasing their prices, and 2) greatly restricting supply and competition by granting monopolies to approved products. FDA approval is extremely difficult and expensive to attain even for the safest and most effective therapies. The FDA's testing process often make little sense from a medical or safety perspective and does not protect patients. Under today's regulations, it would take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars to introduce harmless tongue depressors to the market. 

4. Government licensing of medical practitioners drives costs in much the same way the FDA does, by giving a small group of practitioners a coercive monopoly on medical care. The ""doctor"" as we know it is a creation of government. Our government-trained clinicians have to go through a 10+ year training crucible just to  legally be allowed to perform simple tasks like diagnosing strep throats and setting broken arms that could reasonably be mastered at much less time and expense through more streamlined training programs. They then graduate with enormous debt loads and 10+ years of opportunity cost they they have to recoup by charging patients more than their services are worth—and since the government makes it illegal to compete with them, patients have no choice but to pay up. 

5. A laundry list of government insurance mandates dictate what treatments, procedures, and tests and insurance package has to offer, encouraging their zealous overuse, driving prices up.

6. EMATALA, the law that makes it illegal for Emergency Rooms to turn anyone away regardless of their ability or intention to pay, or even the legitimacy of their complaints. It indirectly forces ER doctors to perform all kinds of unnecessary tests to rule out emergencies. It drives an enormous increase in ER costs by forcing hospitals to pass the costs of running utterly ridiculous and unnecessary tests on the uninsured and treating the uninsured for things that aren't emergencies onto everyone else. This was signed into law by Ronald Reagan of all people, which shows you far away from free market principles the Republicans truly are. 

There are many other examples of how previous acts of government are driving the cost of healthcare, but that's the gist, but those are probably the biggest one. No honest person can't deny that government is the culprit. The cure for our healthcare ills has always been radical free market reform, but none of today's Republicans are talking about any of these things.

Second, because we use it more than anyone else. Due to diet and lifestyle, Americans are far more likely to get sick.

Third, there's a significant problem with other countries not paying the full price of medicines, often due to patent laws being more lax or entirely non-existent.

Herd immunity suffers this problem, because if everyone else gets vaccinated but me, I still can't get the disease, and I didn't have to get the vaccine either.

The problem with economics, particularly the LSE and Chicago school styles, is the focus on supposed ""rational actors,"" and the blind adherence to a preference for profit maximization by individual actors.",1,0,1443217779,1444724308
cvea4dr,0,t1_cve7tf0,epicwinguy101,"I mean, there's no such thing as a truly inexhaustible good.  If everyone went to the park and it got too crowded, or if every town got invaded by foreign militaries at once, and so on, these textbook examples are exhausted.  Generally, the defining feature is again, the non-exclusivity.  It's pretty rare in hard science, much less economics, to have idealized theory match practice perfectly, after all.  Still, such descriptors can be close enough to be useful.

And the important other part of these public goods, more important than the exhaustibility really, is the exclusivity.  Exclusivity isn't like a country club where only so many people are allowed in, it means that I benefit exclusively from my trip to the doctor.  Me getting a hernia repair did absolutely nothing for or to anyone else, no umbrella effect, everyone else's hernias were still the same as before, it was a transaction that only mattered to me and the doctor (and the insurance company, I suppose).  There's no way for other people to freeload on my hernia repair surgery, which makes it exclusive, and not prone to the particular market failures that make me friendly to government intervention.

I wouldn't call it a blind adherence to rational actors, most economists are well aware of these limits, but modeling non-rational actors is still a topic in relative infancy.

cveb1is,0,t1_cvea4dr,ninekilnmegalith,"You discount general health among a population as not having an ""umbrella effect,"" which if true, defeats your analogies as they relate to police, fire, and military. A sick person drags down the economy as much as a ""sick"" neighborhood, i.e., a burglarized one, or the favorite of economists, the ""broken window"" theory. There is no honest way to cast a public good umbrella over any social service in a manner that would not be applicable to social healthcare. You have to bend and twist the definition to even try, example being your failed attempt at casting exclusivity as purely the ability to directly benefit from you receiving services, under that logic, most acts by police are exclusive and
>""there's no way for other people to freeload.""

Under your logic, to claim a benefit from the police stopping you from speeding, or driving drunk, others would have to have been capable of being harmed by you. Much like your hernia example, normally your speeding or impaired driving would never harm me and your arrest would not benefit me directly, it would only be if others happen to be near you while you were driving, just like if you were having a hernia while driving on the freeway.

If you want to reduce this problem to direct benefits, your umbrella wouldn't cover any social service entirely, but we accept those you already agree to generally, thus the logical break when denying healthcare as a social good on par with police, fire, and military.",1,0,1443223799,1444724308
cvefd4d,0,t1_cveb1is,epicwinguy101,"No, you being sick would likely do little to my sense of security, property value, and would not involve a criminal being on the loose.  We have police to enforce laws, man, because people ignore unenforced ones, which is pretty bad if you consider rule of law important.  A drunk driver is a threat to the general public.  My hernia was a threat to nobody but me.

I'm really not sure what this whole business about defeating things are.  Yes, public good is a categorization, and like most categories, breaks down, because the world is not so black and white.  But that's just it, then.  You would find that nothing is pure, theoretically ideal a public good, and nothing is free from externalities, so everything has at least a small amount of it.  Which means that, if your only basis of how to fund things was this metric, you would end up in the logical extreme cases of making either everything, or nothing, public sector.  We have seen both of these extremes in action, and found that despite their ideological ""purity"", they tend to have disastrous consequences in practice.  We have to make judgement calls on the nitty-gritty details in life, and healthcare still much more resembles, from how I see it, as a private good.  When I get sick, it's a problem that effects me at the individual level much moreso than a crime spree or a fire in the apartment one unit over.  When I get healthcare treatment, it affects me, and I doubt my neighbor ever even knows.  Like I said, pure examples of either private or public goods don't exist.  

I'm not sure what this business about ""defeating"" you start each post with is, I'm here to discuss important decisions facing society, not ""defeat"" people, and I hope you share a similarly constructive approach and just chose words indelicately.  And you can read up one the definition of excludability (perhaps your source of confusion was a malapropism on my part, the word I was looking for was ""excludable""), it's right here for you:

Because taxes are too high. If we lower the corporate tax rate, the private hospitals will reduce prices. If we reduce the individual tax rate (etc.), doctors will lower their prices.
Because there is too much regulation. If we reduce regulations, healthcare companies will spend less regulating, and will reduce prices.

Hospitals literally make up the ""cost"" of their services even when a general database of costs for well defined goods and services exists. There is no real law in place that says they cannot charge more than you can afford for their services.

The only way to reduce health care costs is more regulation, which is contrary to conservative ideals of small government, that's why they cannot say anything. The principle of cheaper healthcare is also a socialist concept, which is also why they cannot say anything.",-2,0,1443154279,1444724312
