cuxxikm,0,t1_cuv9qlr,moonflash1,"It is very easy to pick apart this copy pasta. Let us take the first example that says ""Only 57% of Muslims worldwide disapprove of al-Qaeda."" If you click the link, you'll find out, that the polling was done in only 11 Muslim majority countries. There are over 45 Muslim majority countries in the world. Why is the word ""worldwide"" used here when when so many countries were missed? What about the 40 million Muslims who're living in Europe? Do they not have an opinion? Apart from this very glaring error, the poll is also outdated. [Here is a newer poll](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/pg-2014-07-01-islamic-extremism-03/) by PEW reagrding views on Al Qaeda, and negative or unfavourable opinions prevail throughout the Muslim world.

Another poll seems to claim 49,9% of Muslims support Bin Ladin. Muslims from which country? Which denomination? The copy pasta doesn't say. If one clicks through to the article, one finds out the polling was not done by a reputable organisation like PEW or Gallup, but in fact was an online poll that are notoriously unscientific as they are easy to brigade and manipulate. What's more, the results of the original ""poll"" are not even available and the link of the source is broken.

The world public opinion (2009) poll seems to claim that majority of Muslims support attacks on Americans. Yet, if one clicks through to the report and read the very first page, the polling agency itself rejects this notion. They write:

>Large majorities denounce attacks on American civilians, whether in the US or in a Muslim
country, though there has been some softening in the numbers who hold this view strongly. 

What's more, the numbers seem to be fabricated because the statistics in the report differ from the one in the copy pasta. Check Page number 5, the polling results are illustrated quite clearly. The copy pasta says ""61% of Egyptians support attack on Americans"". However, the source itself puts the figure at only 8%. The figures for Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan etc are also quite low, please check the report for yourself.

The ICM poll description claims that says 20% of Muslims think the 7/7 bombings in London were justify. But in reality, if one were to click on [the article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/Poll-reveals-40pc-of-Muslims-want-sharia-law-in-UK.html) and read the source, one would find this very fundamental piece of information.

>The ICM opinion poll also indicates that a fifth (20%)  have **sympathy with the ""feelings and motives"" of the suicide bombers** who attacked London last July 7, killing 52 people, although **99 per cent thought the bombers were wrong to carry out the atrocity.**

Suicide bombing polls are, again, quite outdated. [Here's newer data](http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/pg-2014-07-01-islamic-extremism-11/). It clearly shows that support has been plummeting extensively over the years and the trends are quite encouraging. 

Another poll seems to claim that more than 60% of Muslims in Canada want to enforce Sharia. Again, what do they mean by Sharia? And more importantly, who has conducted the poll? Is it an independent, non partisan, reputable institution? If one click through to the toronotosun article and goes directly to the source, one would realize that the poll was conducted by a think tank called ""Macdonald Laurier Institute"" which according to Wikipedia is ""right leaning"". Does this organisation fulfill the criteria of an unbiased organisation? I don't think so. Nothing wrong with being right leaning per se, but bipartisan organisations should be considered with some scepticism. That is true, both for left leaning and right leaning ""think tanks"".

In light of all this, the using of dubious souces, fabricating numbers, broken links, outdated information that has been misrepresented, I personally cannot fathom how anyone can consider this copy pasta as any reliable.

My father came to the UK for his PHd, got citizenship and quickly started quietly despising those who came over and refused to integrate. From my perspective, I heard a lot of opnions they would not dare tell a white face.

There was the Attack on Charlie Hebdo Cartoonist for publishing cartoons critical if ISIS, as the cartoon represented the prophet muhammad, many mulsims quietly felt that they should have been punished for it.

There was the attempted attack on the french train a few weeks ago.

Now for some things you dont hear about if you are not in the community

Female Genital Mutilation [FGM](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/female-genital-mutilation/Pages/Introduction.aspx) is the removal of a girls clitoris for the sake of her purity. It has been estimated that over 20,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM) in the UK each year, and that 66,000 women in the UK are living with the consequences of FGM. However, the true extent is unknown, due to the ""hidden"" nature of the crime.

It is common culture in muslim and north african countries, and despite attempts to stop it, it is a scourge.


The next major Issue I would like to draw your attention to it [Forced Marriages](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/jul/22/how-prevalent-is-forced-marriage-in-the-uk)  In 2012 he Forced Marriage Unit dvice or support related to possible forced marriages in 1,485 cases. Nearly all these cases involved people from muslim countries. About half of them involved Women under the age of 18 to secure a much older man's UK citizenship.

These are only the women who sought help, many more wouldnt dare try. This is because UK emmigrated muslims still have issues with [honour killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing#United_Kingdom) Even if they are not killed, these girls may have no education past year 11 and see a life ostracised by the community as a death sentence.


Finally, muslims do not integrate. They do not want to integrate, muslim culture does not condone integration.It demands assimilation, but to lose any part of your muslim heritage is considered cultural treason.

cuvj6hk,0,t1_cuvdc8v,plexluthor,"But Muslim immigrants often think it's a Muslim thing, not a North African thing.  Despite people like Reza Aslan denying that it's a Muslim thing, it has become a Muslim thing.  As far as I can tell, it is a North African thing that was adopted (or at least commented on favorably) by Islam and spread elsewhere via that religion.  It also spread geographically, at last among the poor and less educated.  So it exists in North and West Africa (regardless of religion), and in majority-Muslim countries (outside North Africa), and NOWHERE ELSE.  That is, if you are not African, and neither you nor your parents nor grandparents are Muslim, there is a roughly 0% chance that you will have your daughter circumcised.

But to add that it is also an African thing does not at all mean it's not a Muslim thing.  From [this PDF](http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACU138.pdf):

>There is no verses in the Qur’an that support FC, however, many associated the practice with the hadith or sayings in which the Prophet Muhammad PBUH instructed the circumciser to “Cut off only the foreskin (the prepuce or outer fold of skin over the clitoris) and do not cut off deeply (not cutting the clitoris itself), for this is brighter for the face (of the girl) and more favorable with husband.” This hadith is quoted by many Islamic scholars such as Al-Hakim, Al-Baihaqi, and Abu Dawood. Most Indonesian Muslim leaders know that, “Circumcision is a commendable act for men (sunnah) and merely an honorable thing for women (makromah)” (Al-Shawkani cited in Badawi, 2002, Salim Al-Awwa, n.d). Sunnah includes the words, actions and approval (or consent) of Prophet Muhammad

And later in the same report:

>A majority of Muslims in Indonesia are followers of mazhab Syafi’i who perceives circumcision as an obligatory practice for boys and girls, in contrast to followers of mazhab Maliki who perceive male circumcision as an obligatory rule but FC merely as a symbolic gesture. The other two mazhab Hambali and Hanafi believe that circumcision is a sunnah for men and a sign of respect for women (Salam, 1994 quoted in Rahman, 1999; Tatapangarsa, 1980).

Not every Muslim supports FC, but many Muslims do think it's an integral part of their culture, and support it.  But approximately zero non-Muslim UK citizens support it.  Hence, from the perspective of the typical Brit, the only support is coming from immigrants.

I suspect most of them would say it's due to religion, but I really don't know so it wouldn't surprise me if I were wrong.  Perhaps they would say ""it's the clean thing to do"" or have some pseudo-medical justification.  Anyway, if I'm right, then **yes**, you should conclude that it's a Christian thing.  If a bunch of non-Christian Americans circumcised their children, maybe you'd have a case for it being an American thing (""maybe"" because if they are Jews or Muslims, then it's still a religious thing).  In short, you should conclude it's a Christian thing because most Americans are Christians.  You should simply take people at their word when they say it's a religious thing.

If people are circumcising their daughters because a religious authority tells them to (or because they think a religious authority expects them to), it's a religious thing.  At least in Indonesia, that appears to be the case.  And I think the burden of proof is then on people trying to say it's not a religious thing.

Our governments never really considered educating or integrating them, since they were just seen as vessels of 'labour'. Two generations on, and there are Muslims neighborhoods and schools and severe income and wealth disparity, with all the discrimination and the self reinforcement that brings to the community. There are positive developments - many Muslims girls and young women are performing really well in education and society - but the vulnerable group of young, underemployed, undereducated, alienated second generation immigrants who are not seen as wholly part of our society (in Holland, we still call them 'Moroccans' even if their parents were born in the Netherlands) are understandably an easy target for radicalization. Islam gives them that link to the other side of their identity which is otherwise tenuous - they can't go back to their father's land, they can't be fully accepted by their motherland, but the religious community of brothers is ready to embrace them. Some accept only the rituals, beliefs, and community that comes with it, but a small minority of others - often especially the well educated, who are more politicized and more likely to be harboring further resentment - can be militarized and seduced by romantic images of adventurous Jihad.

With that said, in Islam there does seem to be a very strong (relatively speaking) support in many places and cultures for things like implementation of Sharia law, which can include things like death for apostasy (leaving Islam).

There are some numbers here: http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ .  If you scroll down, you'll see things like support for stoning, apostasy, cutting off hands, etc.

Also, there are sites like this which admittedly are not necessarily completely balanced or unbiased, but do list their sources: http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/opinion-polls.htm

I think that Islam is a problem in the world in the same way that Christianity was a problem in the world back in the days of the Inquisition and Columbus and the rest - it's not necessarily that ""Islam"" as an entity is the problem, but many of it's adherents are involved in a clash of cultures with what might be called ""humanistic non-sectarian values"".

I would bet that not all Christians back then were bad people, or held beliefs/values that were non-humanitarian, but some did.  Similarly, some Muslims today hold the same.

I think the conversation is good.  I think if we want to move forward productively as a world, we need to ... resolve this clash of cultures that I think we are in right now.  You could argue that the emergence of the internet/instantaneous communication/improved speed of travel/etc is largely behind this clash, and I think that it is in many ways a fascinating phenomenon, but with a lot of challenges.

Anyway... I wouldn't be surprised if my meaning in this post gets misconstrued.

Some of the largest countries we are seeing the migrants from are Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

With that being said there are still some legitimate concerns over the massive influx of refugees/migrants into the EU. I think both the left and right play emotional politics on the issue and this prevents a real discourse around the issue. 

Some legitimate concerns. 

 The vast majority of those arriving are men, and they have left their entire families behind. These men were often also preyed upon by smugglers who helped them to their destination, but they have often sold their homes and everything they own to get to Europe. One major problem, is that unemployment is already quite high in many Eu ocuntries, and with these people not speaking the language, it will be difficult for many to get jobs. This means that while they gave up everything they own for a dream ( which the smugglers also hype and exaggerate) they may literally find themselves living in a parking lot with nothing, while their family back home also has nothing, including a way out. These people are ripe for the same criminal elements who got them into the country to be exploited. Not to mention Islamist recruiters who also prey upon those who have fallen on hard times. 

 I came from one of the most Atheist countries in the world. And religion ( even Christianity ) is often treated with contempt and scorn. This same disregard for religion is even more strong against Islam, so I think it will be a wake up call to find that while many of these people are coming from muslim countries, they're moving to a secular society which has little regard for their religion.  In some Western countries there have obviously been attempts to try and reduce ""hate speech"" against those who criticize Islam, but in Central and Eastern Europe? Forget about it. Criticism of Islam is the norm, not the exception, and there will be little to no accommodation of their beliefs (if any politician wants to stay in office). 

I could post dozens of links to attempts by those who are trying to pass laws which make blasphemy against Muhammad a crime ( I believe it is in Germany, Italy, France and the UK). Sharia law does exist widely in the UK currently, however it deals more with divorces and civil matters, and doesn't have much to do with the evil ""cut their heads off!"" shit you hear from right wing media. There have been concessions made to these groups to give them official arbitration power over civil matters. 

The last thing to remember is that Europe killed each other for centuries, and each country carved out their little area which they fought for. This is different than in the US where a vast amount of land was secured after a brief ( by european standards) war, and the theft of all of it from the native peoples. So it stands to reason that these small countries all have their own unique cultures. What it means to be danish, or czech, or german, or french have all changed drastically in the last 50 years so there is a revivial of ""protect our culture!"" even though nobody is quite sure what that culture is exactly.

[There is no moderate in Islam.](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/) Islam seeks to convert, kill or enslave the world. It has no interest in diversity and tolerance culturally or politically. It views anyone who does as being subhuman and subject to the will of Allah, which the Koran and Hadith expressly state. It is discriminatory on a gender, racial and religious basis. It is discriminatory against sexual orientation and freedom. 

It is my opinion that the west will have to confront Islamic ideology with force in the very near future. The conditions are already manifesting everywhere in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. ",1,0,1441839678,1444731562

Is radical Islamism really a minority around the world?",1,0,1441754659,1444731562
cuxyi6l,0,t1_cuuzo8u,moonflash1,"Depends on how to define radical Islam. 

Wanting Sharia is not equal to being radicalized or being a supporter of terrorism in my view. Sharia law can mean a multiple things to a Muslim, from praying to fasting to inheritance and burial rites, to criminal law. Those people who answered in favour of Sharia law considered Sharia law to **only be applicable to muslims**(this is fundamental and many people don't realize this). In fact, the same Pew study also suggests that the majority of the world's Muslims absolutely reject terrorism , and are overwhelmingly in favour of democracy and religious freedom. here is the link for anyone who would like to verify: http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/

In my view, even wanting Sharia for only Muslims is quite a conservative opinion, and it is not surprising that religious conservatives make a sizable chunk of the Muslim population. Religious conservatism is a huge problem in the Muslim world and this will remain the case until secularism takes root like it did in the Western world after centuries of conflicts and wars. That does not mean that every conservative Muslim is automatically a radical, which would mean, as the video concluded, that we have 800 million violent radical Muslims (almost 50%). If one were to use one's brain, the world would be in a state of wide scale civil war if that was the case since 50% of the population of any given Muslim majorty country would be radical and fascist and the other 50% would have prevented them from coming to power, like we see in Syria. The fact that out of more than 45 Muslim countries, only 1 or 2 are in a state of wide scale civil war proves that the 800 million figure is a massive over exaggeration.

In the end, this video is being quite dishonest and distorting facts, to push a certain agenda with the help of half truths. Just take a look at the comments and almost all of them are people advocating nuking Makkah and Medina, or genocide against Muslim populations, forced deportations, banning of Islam etc. etc. Nothing gets achieved through such false rhetoric other than the fulfilment of one's own political aims by addressing and articulating thoughts and prejudicial opinions that people already have, all at the cost of the promotion of fascist thought in the general populace. It's funny, the makers of the video are apparently jewish themselves and it's Jews who should know very well how propoganda and half-truths can lead to the degredation of whole group of human beings which leads to drastic consequences.",1,0,1441983435,1444731562

Secondly, the comments under the video are a nice indicator of the type of people such bipartisan channels attract. These channels use buzzwords like ""Bin Ladin"" and ""Sharia"" and suddenly, 50% of all Muslims are ""radicalized"". What you and commentators of the videos don't realize is, radicalism has different trends in different countries. You cannot throw all different types of radicalism together and imply that 50% of Muslims are literally ISIS, when ISIS itself has only around 100,000 fighter which is not even 0.001% of the worldwide Muslim population. A person who supports Sharia in theory might have a utopian society in mind and might not agree with the kind of ""Sharia"" being enforced by ISIS. Just like a Christian would almost certainly tick ""yes"" if asked whether they would like to live under the kingdom of God and be ruled by Jesus, a devout or conservative Muslim will certainly support the rule of religious law.",1,0,1441998812,1444731562

Genital mutilation happens all throughout Africa, even in dominantly Christian areas. Charlie Hebdo was done by extremists (which  make up .5 percent of the Muslim population). 

An example of this is you often do not hear about the religious massacres in areas such as India. India is one of our ""allies"" (depending on circumstances, but generally true) and this type of news is not often projected in the media. Also, on the internet you may hear about it, but the general media often talks about Islamic extremism but exclude Saudi Arabia (not all the time, but very very often comparatively). Saudi Arabia is a huge oil allie for many Western nations, so you hear less negativity about them in order to have the people continue to support interactions with them. 

I believe it is more of a Western v. Eastern culture battle. Same with how we described Communists the same way during the cold war, the Muslims are another group we can generalize for the sake of our interactions over there. Islamic extremism IS  a problem, but so is extremism in any religion. 

Just to toss this in there, look at the fighting that once was happening in Ireland. Sects of Christianity fighting.
