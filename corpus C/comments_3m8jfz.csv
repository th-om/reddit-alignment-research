General assessment of that is this would be a bad idea:

1) You would have to relocate entire states or countries. If you look at a worse case scenario of rising sea levels you can get a pretty good idea how bad that situation would be. Yes its worse case scenario but even half of that is pretty bad.

>We currently have desalination plants and would invest much more money into them if it becomes a very serious problem.

Two problems come to my mind immediately: Desalination plants would be pointless as they would be destroyed/inoperable by rising sea levels and the current desalination plants are so inefficient it is not a feasible option.

The San Diego desalination plant costs many times more than water from other sources and only provides 56,000 acre-feet per year of water (only 7% of  San Diego water needs).

Of course my assessment is based on stagnation. Humans will probably find a way but the question is how far along we are in climate change damage before we find a solution.

Because of places like california and colorado, The public is easily tricked into accepting things like 'assault weapon bans' and magazine limits, non factors (Most crime is done with hand guns, if you count all crime committed with all rifles, they kill less per year than hammers). Now changing the 2ed is political suicide, but there are plenty of politicians going after certain types of guns and trying to enact shitty laws that say universal background check, something that I would not have a problem with, but in reality are shittaly crafted to the point that even the police won't enforce them (Washington state's UBC law comes to mind).

Ninja Edit: Also, its at the top of my list because I believe that guns are the only thing that can guarantee our right to free speech, our right to the pursuit of happyness and all. Governments have been the biggest cause of unnatural death in the 20th century and saying it could never happen in america is inviting it to happen. It is also the only tool that makes 2 people equal and the best tool for self defense if the need ever arises.

Basicly, the guns are not safe, every time anything bad happens with a gun there is an entire section of washington that comes out of the wood works and tries to pass more laws on things they honestly don't understand.

>Also ill bite on the climate change thing too. Dont think its worth the money or what?

Well, while I am sure we have a part in the change, the data shows that the earth is not getting warmer as fast as predicted, every time any prediction has been hashed, it has turned out false and we focus solely on CO2.

I find it disingenuous that CO2 is the only thing 'causing' climate change in the public's eye, There are other factors. That and I don't believe that we will be able to magically 'fix' it with science even if we stopped burning everything, nor do I think we should really try as its an experiment that can only be fucked up once. On top of that, while I do think we should be moving to green tech and stopping pollution, we can't ruin our economy to do it. That can have as much of a disastrous effect as the supposed migration of people due to water levels rising, which won't be drastic enough in our lifetimes anyway. We as humans can, and will adapt, The time frames and predictions have all been wrong thus far with no sign of becoming more accurate and at this point, the people preaching about having to stop climate change now seem to be in a cult fetish that stifle discussion and just call people names if they don't 100% tow the 'the world will end in X years' line.",1,0,1443131360,1444724614

* The science wasn't 100% correct, so it's wrong
* It's too dangerous to try and fix it now
* Don't worry, it won't effect us, let later generations deal with it
* There's no big solution, and small steps aren't worth it

Have I got the gist of it?

cvdrbwb,0,t1_cvd37e9,Sollexs,">The science wasn't 100% correct, so it's wrong

The science is no where close to 100%, so all these people who think 'the science is out' on global warming are wrong. While the sea will rise, its not as drastic as the doomsdayers say.

>It's too dangerous to try and fix it now

Fix is a subjective thing. Do you believe we can control the weather with current science? There are so many variables in this blue ball we call home that trying something drastic would be extreamly dangerous. I also don't think we have the tech to actually geoengineer anything at any sort of large scale yet. Maybe in 50 years we will have the tech and a better understanding, but in the next 10, no.

>Don't worry, it won't effect us, let later generations deal with it

Oh it will effect us, and later generations will have to deal with it anyway, but as I said above, we cant simply just 'fix' it at this point in time. We can work to fixing it, but we are nowhere close right now.

>There's no big solution, and small steps aren't worth it

Did you miss the part that I said we should lessen pollution?

>Have I got the gist of it?

Trump is nuts imo. Listening to him speak gives me two conflicting feelings. The first is feeling like America can't be serious in electing him and that people just say they would vote for him for the lulz/outrage factor. The other feeling is one of impending doom, what if Trump actually was elected? Would he really try doing things like building a wall to keep out illegal immigrants? I like that he's frank and honest, but he also strikes me as a racist and somewhat of a bigot.

So I do see a difference, but a pile of dog shit and a pile of cow shit are still piles of shit. (I'm sure there's a better way to put it, but that's the first that came to mind.)",4,0,1443127594,1444724622

On the other hand, a Trump presidency might be preferable to a Clinton presidency because it would hasten this country's inevitable downfall and enable us to rebuild from its smoldering Reaganomics-scented ashes sooner rather than later. 

Obviously a Sanders presidency would be the best possible outcome, but I would imagine that even if he were elected, the powers that be would stonewall him until his term was up if not just pay off a ""lone gunman"" to take care of it. So that's somewhat depressing. ",1,0,1443123589,1444724626
