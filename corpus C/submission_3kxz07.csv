3kxz07,"Now that Kim Davis is back at work and still refusing issue licenses, even though her deputies are issuing licenses, can she or her local government be sued for civil rights violations?",15,giggleshmack,"I imagine a gay couple going into the courthouse to get their license, Kim happens to be the clerk helping people at the time, and when the couple approaches her, she turns to her deputy and says ""you gotta do this one."" Would that be discrimination by a government employee? And if so, can someone sue for that?
Just FYI, I have no intention of suing anyone in Kentucky ever. This is just for my own curiosity. ",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kxz07/now_that_kim_davis_is_back_at_work_and_still/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442256623,1444728866
