3lgsaw,More than half--53.8%--of current Republican candidate support is going to outsiders. What does this mean for the current Republican Party?,33,iliveintexas,"Based on the poll averaging from [RealClearPolitics](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html) (over 8/31 - 9/13), 53.8% of the support is going to outsiders, who haven't held any political office before.

* Trump is at 30.5%

* Carson is at 20.0%

* Fiorina is at 3.3%

Totals 53.8%. And all 3 have seen significant rises in their support recently.

If you believe Ted Cruz is an outsider (he calls himself one), this number rises to 60.6%, meaning the non-outsider support falls to 39.4%.

What does this mean for the current Republican Party? Or will the Republican Party eventually go back to a non-outsider candidate (as it always has)?",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lgsaw/more_than_half538of_current_republican_candidate/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442602095,1444726914
