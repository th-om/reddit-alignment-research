3jxoev,Republicans spreading fear,17,Worldhope,"In 2008 Barack Obama sprung to national attention, bringing a message of hope and equality. Republicans blocked him at every turn.

In 2015, republican nominees and whatever Trump eventually ends up running as, preach xenophobia, divisiveness and want to rollback everything Obama enacted.

The republicans have even polished off the ""unamerican"" catchphrase (dixie chicks anyone? Communist witchunts of a bygone era) to brand anyone with differing views, heritage and ethnicity in an effort to smother differing views.

Btw, how is the news not latching on to ""shipping millions out of the country"" sounding like some other party back in the 1930s and 40s? Didnt eveyone go to war over that? It is so sad society doesn't remember history or worse, doesn't vilify political maneuvers that reek of tactics meant to divide and encite the crazies.

Not saying the democrats are the cure or the second coming, but you have to agree Trump getting elected is a step backward in social, womens and just about any other advance in the last 30 years...
