I really don't think that's the case.

There are a lot of reasons why blacks make up a larger proportion of criminals than others.  Once again, I've never heard a serious person say this is biological and that is not a widespread believe.  However, Thomas Sowell would probably point to a cultural double-standard that holds blacks to a lower set of exceptions.  If we tell people that they are victims of powers beyond their control, then these communities hold themselves to lower standards.  Affirmative action, overplaying 'racism' as a determination factor in their lives and any number of other things implicitly send the message that they are first and foremost victims.

This is a very broad swath, but from 1980 to 2008, 93 percent of blacks murdered were killed by other blacks.

First of all, you shouldn't just reflexively discount any possibility whatsoever that there might be racial differences in some manner of cognition that could result in a different rates of crime. It's far from a settled matter, empirically. While it's probably true that most people forwarding that possibility are racist, it's intellectually dishonest to dismiss an empirical claim on the basis of the attributes of the person making it.

But more importantly, you're neglecting another possibility: culture. Cultural differences can amount to a *huge* difference in violent crime.

Pre-state societies had homicide rates orders of magnitude greater than Western society today. Hell, even just a century and a half ago in the western frontier of the US it was a veritable bloodbath in most places before law enforcement could get well established.

I think one of the principle reasons for the violent crime disparity between the races is the same reason that the South is more violent than the Northeast and Pacific Northwest in general, even aside from racial composition. And that is that black inner cities rely more on a culture of honour (*""self-help justice""*) where you and your kin (or gang or whatever it may be) take matters into your own hands. This was the case for the South and the western frontier in the 19th Century before law enforcement could be adequately relied upon. All you had to defend you and your interests was your credible reputation for violent retaliation, since the police weren't really a presence.

And both of these black kids are way more likely to be shot by a cop than a white kid of any socioeconomic background. I think that's the issue. Some black Americans aren't living in poverty due solely to racism, but there has been an historic and deliberate racial component to how black americans were treated in larger society with respect to fairness and opportunity. Real estate segregation was real and effectual. 

You raise good points and I agree that there is a ton of nuance involved in the issues that join race, class, and poverty. I guess I'm of the mind that an entire segment of the population was enslavened, ""freed"", and then harshly discriminated against for another 100+ years is enough to consider race to be part of the bed rock for black poverty in a way that white poverty has never and likely will never experience.

BLM is a large movement with many opinions filtering through many individuals. They're like every other group...banded together by an overarching goal but possessing numerous avenues to reach their destination. The Sanders rally was, to me, handled poorly because the BLM participants couldn't break themselves from that agitation mindset that can be, at times, absolutely necessary. In this particular case, Bernie and his people gave them a forum, but they were too entrenched in that ""we demand to be heard"" mode that they couldn't calm themselves as soon as Bernie yielded and start their conversation. But shit....emotions are high. They likely aren't used to being yielded to. Is that girl who spoke probably a bit of a douche? Maybe. Has she bungled her message a bit? Probably. But the rage is authentic. It has to be, and as a white guy, I can't understand what the american black experience is like, but I can accept and support the visceral feeling that it stirs. 

I'm just going to assume you're non-black and american (here in america we tend to reflexively call this category of person ""white""... har har). So the reality of ""needing"" identity politics, a broad term by the way that I'd argue we all utilize, is likely less necessary for you and I. I'm an atheist, I'm white, I'm lower middle class. I'm in the same kind of rigid boxes as everyone else, but these rigid boxes are way more abstract in the way they effect my every day, because I'm not feeling marginalized by any of these facts about myself. No one is discriminating against me for things that are clearly, within reason, in my control. So I can't imagine being discriminated against for something completely fixed, like skin color. 

While I can sympathize with what I think you're saying, and you're right, some people sensationalize and broaden the definition of identity, sometimes to an absurd degree. But I'd counter that it is factual to say that some people simply don't like some other people because they are dark skinned. And some of these same people have been in positions where they could determine who gets an opportunity or a good or a service, and they've used this color -bias to disproportionately affect brown people they don't like. Race, I'd argue, is at the epicenter of poverty and crime for many black americans.

No. This is the same perfect solution fallacy bullshit I pointed out from before. *""We can't solve a specific issue over which we have more control because we have to solve broader issue which we have significantly less control over first.""* Not that nobody is trying to end gang violence, but it's a much larger more complex issue.

What's worse: fearing to speak your mind about these issues, because someone might call you a racist for your opinions, someone might call you a bad guy?

Or, living in a situation where the people in charge of law enforcement treat your community like an ATM and leverage bullshit fines and usurious penalties on you instead of getting their funding through the tax base?

Eric Garner didn't die from asphyxiation or a crushed windpipe.  He chose to resist arrest which led to him getting tackled to the ground.

The officers were attempting to do that.  There were like 7 of them there talking to him for a prolonged time prior to the takedown.

NYPD banned the practice of chokeholds, but the officer was determined to be using the technique to take him to the ground.  Even if that was a lie, the officer violated department procedure, not a law.  Eric Garner wasn't choked to death.

Of course not.

That take down is what a forced arrest looks like.

Officers can always order people out of the vehicle.  Regardless of circumstances, they don't need a reason to give that order.

That cigarette is not a weapon in tons of other cases, for example at music festivals one is never required to extinguish a cigarette when officers are present and there's hundreds of them around, cops are outnumber more than 20:1 and could easily be ""assaulted"" with those cigarettes. They never try to claim something so normal is a weapon until they are harassing someone. She knew she was being harassed. 

So its fine for a police officer to fight someone because they feel endangered, but when they literally kidnap someone and put them in a cage, that's just something you're supposed to expect from any minor infraction.

The short answer is yes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_v._Mimms

The factors cited to support these policies are usually safety-related. Ordering someone out of the car gives the police a better view of them so that they can see if the person is carrying a weapon. It also prevents the driver from accessing a weapon that could be in the car. An added benefit is that it gives someone less time to destroy or hide evidence of other crimes- drugs, guns, etc...

I can think of two reasons you're hearing ""black on black crimes"" arguments: 

First, Black on black crime is the most over represented per capita crime statistic.  If any group has a ""unique phenomenon"" in reference to crime, it would be black on black crime.  

Most analysis puts AA's at ~15% of the US population, but accounting for ~40% of the serious crime.  Combine that with the ""8%ers"" rule of thumb, and you've got 1.2% of the US population responsible for 32% of the total crime in the US.  While there are many other factors and variables to consider, statistically speaking it *is* a phenomenon.  

Secondly, it's a counterargument.  If some group started #______LIVESMATTERS, they the ""______ on ______"" statistics would show that the overwhelming majority of murders would be intraracial and we'd be right back in the same place.  ",3,0,1442781680,1444726434
cv8adt3,1,t3_3lnheb,AnotherMasterMind,"blacklivesmatter reduces an issue to racial bias.  By bringing up black on black crime, skeptics are questioning the narrative being projected onto the public by these activists.  Is it true that the phenomenon of police officers shooting people is a reflection of police officers generally not valuing black people's lives?  Maybe, but maybe that's an oversimplification.  
The message is crafted in such a way that suggests cops value the lives of whites and don't value the lives of blacks to some extent, which might have some truth to it, but anyone can play that game.  If we're gonna reduce the behavior of cops to racial issues, by pointing to recent events that are subtle and complex, then we can reduce almost anything to anything.  
Black people who are shot in America are far more likely to be shot by an aggressor who is black than a cop, or white.  This shows that the outrage may not be pointed in the right direction.  Maybe there is no right direction.  Maybe all of this is arbitrary cherrypicking of stats that gives us the answer we want.  People often support a movement because it supports a narrative people want to be true, and the narrative of bias towards people of color in America, while I personally agree it exists in some ways, is often as easy to dismiss as it is to accept.

Blackliversmatter is wants to be a continuation of the civil rights marches, but in reality it is a continuation of ""The man is keeping me down"" attitude. I think that attitude has done more harm to the modern black community than any police dept could.

There are bad cops and I want reform of police discipline procedures, but its got nothing to do with race, policing is just a career path that bullies like.

Blacks are a group when it's police, or <any other group> ""against"" blacks, but blacks are not ""a monolith"" when many blacks are acting in a similar manner towards any other group, including their own? What kind of messed up, one-way, hypocritical logic is that?

>Blacks aren't killing each other because of their melanin count, so just stop trying to make a parallel between the two. 

The fact is what it is - blacks are killing other blacks at a disproportionate rate of any other group on group violence - white on black, Asian on Latino, white on white, Latino on Latino, etc..


>And I don't think the movement even had to ""address"" it, it's kind of only obviously implied by the name.

Though it may be implied by the name - the focus of the movement is police on black violence. If you're going to name your group in a way that shows concern for black lives, you better take action that is consistent with your overt message.

To name your group ""black lives matter"" and only address a small fraction of the way that blacks die unnecessarily at the hands of other humans is absolutely absurd. 

If the movement wanted to call themselves something like ""Blacks against Police Violence"" or something like that - that's a more accurate representation of the movement. By and large, the movement does not address black on black violence - which is how many young black men meet their unfortunate demise.


>How are you going to sit there and type out that black people are not against black on black crime? Like, honestly...how?

What is the BLM movement (the topic at hand) doing to effectively improve this condition? 

Let's also not ignore the fact that many police altercations that blacks have are the direct result of responding to black on black crime. 

> The one positive change? LAPD officers are now equipped with body cameras.

This is not in any way directly attributable to BLM. Police body cameras have been a thing long before BLM, and only continue to grow in popularity as *many* groups call for body cameras on police - and as departments learn that body cameras are a great way to mitigate risk, more departments will be rolling them out.

>I bet your the type that ignores the existence of privilege. 

What?

>You seem to be in need of some new perspectives, bruh.

As do you.

Let's hear some practical solutions to the issues at hand - not just divisive comments. This is exactly why the BLM movement is continuing to lose legitimacy as people see that there's not a whole lot of substance coming out. 

TBH, I think the solution to these issues lies within both the police community and the black communities, and both groups need to at least see things from the other's prospective to come to a solution. Police body cameras and some policy changes will help with the micro, but change has to come from from *both* sides to help at a macro level.

>Have we reduced the dependence from municipal budgets on aggressive traffic citations in the last 10 years?

Depends on the area.  Any area that has traffic cameras are generally earning revenue from laws.  But it's a local issue.  Some of the dependence on revenue was caused by the economic downturn when funding was becoming scarce.


>How would you describe the state of policing, criminal sentencing and police aggression 20 years from now to how it is now from one racial group to another?

In general I would say policing is fine.  Some areas have problems, but those tend to be high crime areas.

Criminal sentencing, I think some of it needs to be addressed, such as mandatory minimums and laws like CA's 3 strikes law.

As I addressed above, if positing black on black crimes is a dismissal of your agency and individuality, how is lumping all blacks together under the banner not the same thing? What about black people who don't want any part in the movement but now feel that they have to be attached to it due to the slogan?

>(2) arguments that bring up 'black on black crimes' make the faulty assumption that blacks killing other blacks is somehow a unique phenomenon of western culture or is otherwise more reprehensible than the norm. Whites kill other Whites, Latinos the same, as have African-American

I don't know if anyone would disagree with you on this one, but would it not make it even more telling of the movement that they have to advertise the importance of black lives over other lives? Yes, whites kill whites, Hispanic people kill other hispanic, but I don't know of any other group that addresses these concerns in a monolithic movement separate from other groups.

>(3) wholly ignores what is at the core of #blacklivesmatter, which is an outcry that extends well beyond the presumed social-boundaries of Black America. To reinforce this, I go no further than a New York Times Editorial on the topic:

""Demonstrators who chant the phrase are making the same declaration that voting rights and civil rights activists made a half-century ago. They are not asserting that black lives are more precious than white lives. They are underlining an indisputable fact — that the lives of black citizens in this country historically have not mattered, and have been discounted and devalued.""

That is an interesting editorial comment on the movment, but it makes it appear that black people have it worse then they did in the past.

cv7rbnz,1,t3_3lnheb,ISBUchild,">Positing black on black crimes as a dismissal of the #blacklivesmatter movement strips us of our agency and individuality.

What I'm getting from this statement is:

- In the context of blacks as victims, the black group identity is valid, essential to understanding , and a locus for political action.

- In the context of blacks as perpetrators, or otherwise having poor cultural metrics, the black group identity is meaningless, deindivuating and dehumanizing, and totally orthogonal to the real issues.

While race is not salient to every issue, organized black activism must desist with having it be selectively salient in viewing the same issue from different angles.

>arguments that bring up 'black on black crimes' make the faulty assumption that blacks killing other blacks is somehow a unique phenomenon of western culture or is otherwise more reprehensible than the norm.

Most people who are killed are killed by someone of the same race, because most homicides are between people who know each other or are in the same community. However, the differences in rates of homicide between racial groups in the United States are large; Blacks are as more likely to offend than whites as men are more likely to offend than women. Blacks are roughly half of US homicide offenders, despite being fewer in number than whites among the impoverished. This is a large, order of magnitude difference in offending rates.

To the non-black outsider, the outsized community and media reaction to the vanishingly small number of white>black homicides strikes some as a selective outrage, unjustified for a group that has become complacent with crimes committed by others of their group. Thus, they try and delegitimize the anger, by putting it in (what they see as) proper perspective. This obviously doesn't resonate, because they're mostly talking past each other.

>They [demonstrators] are underlining an indisputable fact — that the lives of black citizens in this country historically have not mattered, and have been discounted and devalued.

In the aggregate, they are devalued, yes. If I were forced to choose between pressing a button that killed a random white person, or a random black person, I would push the latter ten times out of ten. All else being equal, I prefer people like me. I have no doubt most people would do the same for their respective group.

In the context of crime, aggregate actions are relevant to the conversation. A key component of society respecting rights and assuring equal dignity is reciprocity. People must be believe that they are acting in good faith with others who can/will act in good faith with them. This puts blacks as a group in a tenuous position in the minds of whites, who look at (what they see of) black behavior, and see people that don't appear to value life as highly as they do. Thus when organized black groups make a lot of noise about, primarily, white on black homicides, the gut reaction is that blacks should put their own house in order first before calling out whites as being callous and indifferent. This discounting of black deaths has not been helped by the black victims that have received media attention in recent years. Marches in the street for a man killed by police really don't bring tears once you've seen a video of that man robbing a convenience store shortly before the fatal encounter, even if the shooting itself was unjustified.

If BLM wants more attention to black deaths, and gets it, expect it to backfire in a huge way. If whites were confronted with video of every black death at the hands of a police officer, treated with the media attention and seriousness of a presidential address, sympathy would fade even faster, as we watch one justifiable homicide after another.

As you might infer, I am a strongly conservative person, and have a few strongly conservative friends and family members. Several tough-on-crime, tea-party types who go to church every Sunday. Surprisingly, we are usually unanimous in agreeing with policy issues put forward by black advocacy groups with respect to police. We are sick of unaccountable police, and want to see them wear body cameras. We are disgusted at the harassment of blacks for trivial issues by law enforcement, and the near-inescapable financial trap of petty civil fines and tickets. We are concerned about disparate sentencing by the courts, and wish for justice to be equally applied. But while we think these are important ethical standards to uphold, we don't really expect much material improvement to come from such reforms. To us, black problems are mostly self-inflicted, and we can only try to obstruct their progress as little as possible.

I want to be able to say that black lives matter in the way that they do to you, or your supporters. But that wouldn't be honest. When we see another black man lying dead at the hands of police, after some prior criminal encounter escalated, there is some sadness. We wish the police had found a better way to cool down the fight. We wish his life had gone in a different direction, so he didn't end up in that situation at all.

But given that situation, we're not really that sad that he's dead. And while we don't say it out loud, it's partly because he's black.",0,0,1442740591,1444726446

Cops are people who always have power over you and if you disagree with what they're doing, you need to use the law against them and not resist arrest.

I feel like if people followed that advice, then less people would die.  Of course I think it's great to highlight police abuse of power because it shouldn't happen, but cops are human beings and humans love to have power trips.

I'm not an American so I don't think I can quite grasp how bad things are there, but in the UK the police are nowhere near as awful as they seem in the US.

I don't have a great knowledge of everything in the US but from anything I've ever read, black areas tend to have higher levels of crime because they tend to be areas with higher levels of poverty. Consequently it becomes a vicious cycle. ",-3,0,1442754608,1444726454

Having a different opinion is not stripping someone else of their opinion.

Using an old but relevent example, there obviously is a problem when 71% of African Americans believe OJ Simpson was innocent of murder while the majority of non-African Americans believed him to be guilty.

The police and crime is viewed through different lenses.  There obviously is a mistrust of police and the justice system and the OJ Simpson case highlights these differences given the high-profile nature of the case and the copious amount of information available about the crime.

We're dealing with a similar scenario IMO.  I look at the FBI crime statistics and see a significant difference in crime rates between African Americans and others.  Some justify this by stating that the justice system is unfair.  Fine, just count bodies then - dead people and who was conviced for their murder.  The stats don't lie.  Police rightfully spend the majority of time in crime filled areas and as a result, interactions with potentially bad outcomes will increase.

Far more African Americans are killed by the hands of other African Americans, not police.  Logical thinkers come to the conclusion that if all black lives matter movement is focused on all issues, all sources of deaths should be addressed, not just police incidents.  The vast majority of police incidents are ""justified"", not police murdering blacks.

IMO, we back to my original comparison - African Americans and others sometimes view the world through a different lens.  There are many historical reasons for this, but they exist.

Edit:  Decent source of information relative to my OJ comment.  Note that time has changed opinions.

cv83jdh,1,t3_3lnheb,Weenercopter,">(2) arguments that bring up 'black on black crimes' make the faulty assumption that blacks killing other blacks is somehow a unique phenomenon of western culture or is otherwise more reprehensible than the norm. Whites kill other Whites, Latinos the same, as have African-American

If you want to talk about faulty assumptions, then cleanse yourself of your own faulty assumptions. 

The fact that similar ethnic groups kill each other more frequently does not negate the fact that blacks kill each other at *disproportionately higher rates* than other races do.

Go ahead and call me racist for stating a fact, but your misrepresentation and ignorance is one of many reasons why people don't take BLM seriously.  

***

Other reasons:

* ""Pigs in a blanket!  Fry 'em like bacon!"" 
* Harassing and interrupting Scott Walker during campaign speeches.
* Harassing and interrupting Jeb Bush during campaign speeches.
* Harassing and interrupting Bernie Sanders during campaign speeches.  

Fuck that. 

A movement about ending police brutality is important.  I do not in the slightest disagree with that idea.

But BLM's messaging is way off, and they need some serious PR help.  Hell, before they re-designed their website, it was all about Michael Brown *for months*.  He was unfortunately--*but legally*--killed by a police officer acting in self-defense!  Yet he was one of the catalysts for the ""movement.""  

BLM is misdirected, which is why people are trying to redirect them to the bigger issues in black communities--it isn't because people are trying to de-legitimize a police brutality movement.  ",0,0,1442772935,1444726458

This is a naked assertion. Black population percentage is always the highest correlate of a US area crime rate, and persists controlling for [poverty and related miscellany.](http://i.imgur.com/hfgL5vF.png)

>When people make arguments about black on black crimes, it's a way of avoiding real issues of why those crimes are occurring.

It's a weak attempt to direct attention to the main source of violent black deaths and away from the minority source, which is interracial homicide. This is not about avoiding the real cause, but instead is about trivializing a group's most vocal concerns by putting them in scale.

If you are a white outsider looking at black issues, you will try and optimize for ""lowest possible number of black homicide victims"", which interracial violence is a very small part of. If you are black, you might place a premium on interracial victims, because of the circumstances in which such publicized incidents occur, and the perceived apathy of the larger society to those deaths.

Conservative whites who respond by pointing to high black-black homicide numbers aren't deflecting from why crime happens; They are completely missing the point of the BLM-type criticism, and try to delegitimize it. Unfortunately this misunderstanding is at the heart of the BLM frustration, which only increases tensions.",4,0,1442736136,1444726458
