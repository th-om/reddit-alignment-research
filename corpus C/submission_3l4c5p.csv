3l4c5p,A rising tide that raises all ships is a terrible metaphor for the economy.,15,improbable_humanoid,"A more appropriate metaphor would be the human body. Just as cash is the lifeblood of a business, money is the lifeblood of an economy. It has to circulate constantly and proportionately to the parts of the body that need it, or the body dies.

Even if you grant that investor class is the brain of the body, today's extreme income inequality is essentially the equivalent of having all the blood trapped in the head. Eventually, the entire body dies. Of course, if you put a choke-hold on the head, no blood will get to the rest of the body and once again, the body dies. A brain in a jar isn't very useful to anyone.

In order for the economy to thrive, money has to change hands constantly, and this ""blood"" has to be delivered proportionately to the parts that need it. It has to keep the organs, heart, and lungs (the middle class) healthy, or the economy won't thrive. It has to keep the hands and feet (the working class) flushed or the economy can't move (work) or feed itself (consume). It, of course, has to keep the brain (the investor class) oxygenated, or innovation is impossible. But the harder the economy is struggling, the more blood must flow to the arms and legs. Because you can neither run or fight if all the blood flows to your head.

What does this mean in real terms? Well, basically, a reasonable level of income redistribution in the form of increasing marginal income tax rates and government investment combined with progressive tax policy that increases the buying power of the working and middle classes (reduction or elimination of sales tax, for example). Nothing crazy.... but a higher maximum bracket, with proportionately higher marginal rates up to that amount. And capital gains income over a certain amount would be taxed at or above the level of regular income. And the estate tax would be put back at reasonable levels. That said, I could totally see reducing corporate and property taxes.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l4c5p/a_rising_tide_that_raises_all_ships_is_a_terrible/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442368939,1444728071
