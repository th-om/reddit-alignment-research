Meh...I'd prefer you create the list of mentally ill folks first and then use that in the process of the background check to buy the gun.

Use that list to reference the people who want to buy and if they hit on the list then turn them away.  

The first two you mentioned you can pretty much guarantee will never happen, ever.  I don't want anyone including (especially) the Govt to be able to look up what I own.  A license creates another level of undue burden to exercise your rights and won't really do shit anyways.

First, we would need to go after gangs, as they make up the vast majority of homicides in our country. I think the best way to start going about this is to dry up their money supply, so legalizing and regulating drugs is the way to go since that is most gangs main money source, that would also help quite a bit down south of us in mexico.

I don't know of a good way to fully finish off gangs, but gettign people out of poverty would probably help, the best way to go about that though I honestly don't have a clue.

On the note of mass shooters, We need to stop glorifying them every time some fuck shoots up a school, The media is giving others the 'green light' to become famous as long as they get a high kill count, and that is just wrong. We need to change how mass shootings are reported - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PezlFNTGWv4

That should be a good start.

Sure, since about 1/3 households have guns already, any new laws on mental health to prevent suicide would remove them from the stats of people it could possibly help. 

You also are not going to be able to give a diagnosis based on a test or single visit with a mental health professional. Suicidal thoughts are usually a symptom of something else, depression for example. 

Now I don't have any issue with a day or two waiting period, which a good number of states have. However, if I suffer from depression, diagnosed or not, does not mean I am suicidal. Millions of Americans suffer from depression and don't kill themselves or others.

I could own a gun for a week, month, year, 5 years or whatever, and say my wife leaves me, my kid dies, I lose my house or some other kind of tragic, depressing event, and I could become suicidal. No law could ever prevent that, I already have the gun. No therapist would have diagnosed me, since I was not suicidal at the time, and I have more then a fair share of ways to commit suicide without a gun even if I didn't have it.

The resources would be better spent on suicide hotlines, and places for people to seek help to prevent suicide. The using a gun is a symptom of the issue, not the cause. We should address the cause.

More and more places are passing laws to do this. Also just because something is illegal doesn't mean 100% of the people agree with that law. Laws don't determine morality.

>If there's another real reason not to include them, by all means share it.

The real reason is because it has no place in a gun control discussion. Even if gun control was going to lower suicides, it still has no place restricting people who want to do something to themselves. Your body is your property, and no one can tell you that you can't do what you want with your body.

Lastly there are many countries with higher suicide rates as the United States with less gun ownership, and more gun control.

See this is what I'm saying. And I agree with you, in general. But I'm saying this argument can't work here due to the fact that suicide is illegal. If it were my right to do what I want with my body, without exception, I would say don't count suicides in the tally of gun deaths because then any gun control efforts aimed, even partially, at lowering those types of gun deaths would be an infringement on my right to shoot myself.

>Lastly there are many countries with higher suicide rates as the United States with less gun ownership, and more gun control.

That may be true, and I'm not really here to argue the effectiveness of gun control. There are plenty of factors that play into everything and I certainly don't know all of them.

I guess it doesn't really matter if it should be illegal though. Since it is, you can't make the case that people have a right to shoot themselves. Since you can't make that case, you have no grounds to say suicides aren't the same as any other gun death. They are literally identical acts as far as this discussion is concerned.

>Because limiting liberty because a few individuals who are a ridiculously minority is stupid. 

Limiting liberty is subjective. An increase in gun regulations isn't necessarily against the constitution. And let's remember the laws still wouldn't be specifically based on suicides simply because they were included in a statistic that potentially served as *part* of the justification to even pass the law. 

>We don't just sit here and go ""well its illegal so we should try and stop it.""

I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying *since* it's illegal we have no right to use the argument that ""we have a right to do what we want with our body"" to justify leaving suicides out of the TOTAL tally of gun deaths. I hope the difference is clear here.

>Also you would have to be naive to sit here and not realize that this number is used just to make the problem look more scary to those who are ignorant of how the numbers work.

Yes I can, do you know how the court system in this country works? People used to think the 2nd amendment meant it was a collective right to own guns, they took it to court and challenged it because it was thought to be an individual right.

> Since you can't make that case, you have no grounds to say suicides aren't the same as any other gun death. They are literally identical acts as far as this discussion is concerned.

According to the government but not according to the populace. Also suicide isn't a federal crime and it is not illegal everywhere.

Except zero laws do that. All of the studies that say suicide is a greater risk for suicide are done by economists in a fashion that tries to convince people that the economic risks aren't worth. They aren't judging policy, but ownership.

Both suicides and homicides are, by an overwhelming margin, mostly acts that occur in the heat of the moment.

Because making it impossible for the central government to not allow people to own the means for force prevents the central government from possibly abusing a monopoly of force.

Allowing the government to raise a standing army came at the cost of not allowing the government to disarm the people.

The background here is very important.  The amendment is only limiting the governments ability to limit the right to bear arms, because the right to self defense is implied to be a natural right of man.  The framers were taking a lot of cues from philosophers of the time and Locke's influence is plain: Life, Liberty, Property.  The right to self defense falls under the right to life, and the second amendment is deliberately limiting the federal governments ability to limit that right.

So you really think that a valid argument for gun control is that some opponents of gun control are supporters of drug control?

I mean I get you, I'm on your side, I fully believe the government needs to completely get out of the business of regulating drugs.  One major issue though with the two party system is that you can't get a candidate that supports all of your views, and that candidates have to pander to an audience to get votes.  You just take turns ticking off the biggest possible demographics and boom - you have a two party opposing views platform.

All anyone wants to do with guns is:

* practice putting holes in paper
* go outdoorsing and come back with delicious wild organic meat
* own/use pretty, historic, or fun guns
* own a gun for self defense

Realistically people oppose more legislation because instead of a give and take, it's been a give give give, nobody's going to bother permitting SBR's while they legislate another mandatory minimum waiting period, or another age-restriction on ammo purchase, or another mandatory background check....

Fair enough about pistols/semi-automatics. The listing of ""a/b/c"" really has no bearing on the level of restrictions here. Just put them up as I was thinking.

Maybe not a ""need"" but there is a large segment of people that do want change. So a change to make things more transparent/understandable for many might be a good thing. 

>cars are less regulated than guns as it is right now.

You're right. Cars are not regulated that much, but there are still different licenses classes. A class D license will let me drive anything from a small moped to a Ferrari. However if I want a motorcycle i need a special classification for that (class M), which maybe could be the semi-auto/handgun classification type. Then if I want to drive a semi/tractor trailer, I need a class C (CDL). Then within the CDL class you can break it down even more. So maybe some of the NFA items would fall under this type of category. 

These category can be broad, and not really restrict the weapons once in that category similar to cars. I can buy my .22 rifle for squirrels. Maybe i want to modify it? Pistol grip? Maybe I want a scope instead of iron sights? J Maybe I want a more sensitive trigger, or a silinecer? Just like I can bore the engine on my car, put new rims/tires on.

You see, you here are thinking that gun rights activists have not been compromising for the last 100 years while anti-gun rights people have been, its actually the other way around. Gun rights activists have compromised a lot, a hell of a lot, while anti-gun rights people have not compromised at fucking all. We don't need more bullshit laws, we don't need more bullshit things like licenses. we need to enforce existing laws, that would be doing something that actually may have an effect that does more than 'feel good' to the morons who want to 'do somthing for the sake of doing somthing'.

>You see, you here are thinking that gun rights activists have not been compromising for the last 100 years while anti-gun rights people have been, its actually the other way around.

And that's probably true. But I don't think the anti-gun supporters will quite down anytime soon. Guns are easy to look at as being dangerous, because of their power. 

I'm totally fine with current laws, but I feel like if something is not  changed about how gun laws are currently written things will go down hill for gun supporters.  
Enough negativity publicity from guns will result in changes, look at nuclear energy as an example. You may be 100% right in your beliefs, but guns are too easy to say ""look they're bad"". 

I know gun supporters do not want changes to how things work, but people are stupid and emotional. Wouldn't it be better for gun supporters to be at the forefront of drafting legislation, so the anti-gun people don't beat you to it? 

And maybe no matter what changes are made guns will always be viewed as bad by others. So maybe the only thing you can do is dig your heels in and fight back.

>That's 100% true. If that is the truth, then you shouldn't have to worry about any new laws taking effect. But noisy people, effect those who may not know about the issue, to change things.

Yep, the main problem is a lot of people who are pro gun control don't understand guns, all they see is the phrase 'assault weapon' in the media following a video of someone fireing a full auto rifle (an accual assault rifle, not a 'assault weapon') and they see action movies that portray firearms completely wrong (yet entertainingly). These things combined with fear caused by the 24/7 news on mass shootings (which play a big part IMO in why mass shootings happen, these losers see other mass shooters being propped up by the news as 'anti heros' and they say to themsleves 'if I kill x amount of people, I can also be famous') has caused people that don't understand firearms to be pro gun control. Thankfully the country is waking up after seeing the absolute failures of the last assault weapons ban as well as people trying to actively educate others on the subject, which is probably why we have the highest support in quite a while. go internet!

>Good luck then. I will never support banning weapons but reasonable controls I may support.

I am fine with reasonable controls, the thing we may disagree on is exactly what is reasonable. I am fine with full autos and destructive devices being part of the NFA, a much higher regulated system. I am not fine with more regulations added on normal guns because they are meaningless. Anyone who wishes to do harm will get a weapon via the black market or straw buyers. hell, there was a california anti gun democrat who was selling full auto guns and RPGs to gangs just a year or 2 ago.

>That could be. But I'm trying to promote discussion or alternatives to many people calling for bans. I've made where I stand on the issue fairly clear; I'm not intimate with the knowledge of gun classifications, and I'm rather indifferent to control/no control.

As a historical collector who has many firearms, I do have a stand on this issue. I am intimately knowledged with gun classifications, and there really is no difference between rifles and pistols. Bolt action weapons can be fired about as quick as semi autos so long as you are trying to be accurate with both (Aka not just spraying bullets, because doing that with a semi auto will mean you don't hit anything anyway unless you are feet away from your target).
I have also seen people fire revolvers as fast, or faster than semi auto pistols, though they still take longer to reload. There is no need for more bans, bans don't work. There is no real need for more laws, we already have 20,000 gun laws on the books. We need to enforce existing laws, and if we really want to bring down the homicide rate, we need to fix the underlying problems, gangs and poor people, instead of trying to go after a 'easy' bandaid called gun control.

So, over all our goals are the same, reduce deaths, but our methods are vastly different, and I don't see your methods having any effect as they don't go after the root cause, they are going after the inanimate tool, not the people who pull the trigger.",1,0,1444083989,1444717614

I'm not so sure. I never said that what I suggested is what I wanted. I threw it out there as an option. I perpetually play devils advocate, and it often has me typically trying to think of what the opposition may say. 

I live in Wisconsin and our Governor passed a law, that allows us to have our hunting rifles in our cars uncased as long as they are unloaded now. Love that change, and it seems like less regulation to me. 
>Bolt action weapons can be fired about as quick as semi autos so long as you are trying to be accurate with both

In my experience hunting, you can be MORE accurate with a bolt action than with a semi-auto. As when you reload you have to re-aim, and your body is great at re-aligning to the target. 

>There is no need for more bans, bans don't work. There is no real need for more laws, we already have 20,000 gun laws on the books

And I'd say this is 100% overkill. I'd rather have them scrap many of the current laws with new/more refined laws (never going to happen). 

>we need to fix the underlying problems, gangs and poor people, instead of trying to go after a 'easy' bandaid called gun control.

100% honest here, i don't think any politicians are truly looking to solve these problem (maybe gangs) but poor is a consistent voting block that's fairly easy to manipulate with buzz words that may help them. 

> I don't see your methods having any effect as they don't go after the root cause

I really wasn't thinking that what I suggested would actually reduce any of these crimes. It was just an idea for how to ""regulate"" gun usage as opposed to how it is handled now.

Spending money is speech.  Every time you spend money, you are making a particular statement that is impossible to make without spending money:

""I prefer spending this money now for this reason instead of all the other things I think I could get with this money now or later""

E.g. When you buy a loaf of bread for $4 you say to the entire bread supply chain and related markets ""I prefer having this loaf of bread today for $4 than anything else that I could get with $4 now or in the future"".

It's a bit wordy.  

Interested groups aggregating money in order to purchase advertisements that support their interests is irrefutably speech.  The spending money is speech (""I want to advertise...""), the things they spend money on amount to speech (literally paying someone to say something for them).

The issues are that a modern campaign relies on massive spending to persuade people, and that the government is capable of providing a return on investment for some interests.  The result is that some interests that stand to gain from government action practice 'rent seeking', where they help a candidate assume office in order to have their industry regulated in a way that benefits them.

In the past (50s?), I believe there was a national election budget from which funding for debates and other 'neutral' campaigning was drawn from, with a limit to overall spending.  On the other hand, in the distant past early presidents would literally throw open bar parties to.. uh.. make their political statements.  Another perspective comes when thinking of the electoral college.  A long time ago information was slow and unreliable, so voters voted for electoral college members which in turn represented their interests at the national election (having better information).  Nowadays, the electoral college is a footnote.

It's altogether a difficult problem to solve, since limiting the capacity of individuals to pay for speech isn't in line with American values.

The Bill of Rights is a limit on governmental regulation.  All it would do is narrow the scope of that limit.  There is no evidence that the Founders intended the limits in the Bill of Rights to be interpreted as broadly as possible.  

For example, the Seventh Amendment preserves the right to jury trial for ""suits in common law.""  Even though today all suits are brought before a common law court, we still maintain the distinction that if the suit seeks a *remedy* that is not found in common law (but is instead an equitable remedy, like a permanent injunction), then they are not entitled to a jury trial.

Well, to interpret it today, we first need to know what was written to start and why.  It provides *guidance* as to what the intentions for the future were, and why we need to amend to change things.

Like, don't just tell me what you think, explain *why* you think it, e.g.

History, mostly.  Madison, who wrote the phrase and co-opted it from the Articles of Confederation, has explicitly said as such, and it makes sense in the construction of the time.  It's pretty cut and dry.

> The components of the 2nd amendment are presented as part of a single sentence - typically an indicator that components are meaningfully coupled in some way.

Meaningful has many ideas behind it.  Considering the revolution was still fresh in people's minds, the fear of the government disarming the citizenry was tantamount.  So you add a non-operative description as an example as to why the right shouldn't be infringed.  It's not really crazy.

> I'm much less interested in said rebuttals than I am in understanding the actual logic underpinning the assertions you've presented so far.

The logic really comes down to what's written, with any possible or plausible confusion being explained by the times it was written.  We need not rely on the original meaning (i.e., speech only being the written word, arms only being muskets) to apply it to today, but we do need to make sure our interpretations match what the amendment exists to protect (expression in all forms, arms in all forms).

Yeah, that's definitely a reasonable explanation for the militia component - do you know if there are explicit historical statements to the effect that the militia component was intended to be non-operative, similar to Madison's statements about the general welfare clause?

The ['Living Tree Doctrine'](http://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/ccs/index.php/i-o/795-living-tree-doctrine) is what's taught and celebrated in Canada- but we have a very different system of government. Sometimes a bit wacky. Are Constitution is semi-unwritten and includes a continuous history of jurisprudence that descends back beyond even the creation of the Magna Carta in 1215. 




>More recently, cases like Reference Re Same-Sex Marriage updated the living tree concept. This 2004 case questioned the constitutional validity of same-sex marriage. Building on Justice Sankey’s “living tree” metaphor, Chief Justice McLachlin introduced another metaphor, stating that the “ ‘frozen concepts’ reasoning runs contrary to one of the most fundamental principles of Canadian constitutional interpretation, that our Constitution is a living tree which, by way of progressive interpretation, accommodates and addresses the realities of modern life.”[6] By allowing the term “marriage” to adapt or grow with contemporary times, its meaning within legislation became modernized and subsequently included unions of same-sex couples.[7] 

>Allowing the Constitution to evolve is not a simple task. Doing so takes time and considerable thought, and the courts make changes only after much deliberation. Sections of the Constitution that are questioned or challenged must be examined within the context of contemporary society to ensure that they adapt to change but still maintain the “framers’ intent,” or what the Constitution’s authors were trying to achieve.[8] Therefore, contemporary interpreters must focus on what the originators intended it to accomplish rather than what the text actually states before allowing the Constitution to evolve or remain unchanged.[9]

actually, the entire thread is quite literally about that. this thread is based on this quote:

so we aren't allowed to discuss this because SCOTUS already made up its mind?",2,0,1444072070,1444717734

> A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

As it's written it's not granting a right at all -- it's actually removing from the federal government the ability to limit the ability of *the people* (not ""the militia"") to keep and carry firearms.  That's a big distinction, because the second amendment is written to  *protect* the right, implying it is self-evidently established.  Philosophically, the right to bear arms is an extension of the natural right to protect oneself.

Side note, an interpretation of 'a well regulated militia' is that the entire body of the people is empowered as  a 'well regulated militia', that is to say that the popular body forms an additional 'branch of government'.  This falls in line with the vision of confederacy/federalism where the people have absolute power, delegated to the states, delegated to the federal government.  (Federalism is people > federal > state)

The supreme court in the past has clarified that the second amendment *does* establish the positive right to bear arms, and the negative right protecting the people *from the federal government's* attempt to limit that right.

So, the text, as it was written:

* protects the natural right of self defense
* protects the regular people from having that right diminished by the federal government
* establishes that the ownership and possession of firearms is a cornerstone of that natural right",13,0,1444072463,1444717734
