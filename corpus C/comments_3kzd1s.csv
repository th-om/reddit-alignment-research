What was once a core part of his platform, the NSA, has now fallen out of the public eye, with some progress in the USA Freedom Act. Without that he is reduced to simply talking points, instead of adding anything to the discussion, he is repeating the things he has repeated and detailed fully several months ago, but the issues he is detailing do not matter as much. 

Long term candidates are now pulling out detailed tax plans, health care plans, and so on ... and some candidates are surging, Ben Carson, Donald Trump, who will fall at some point at farthest right after the Iowa Caucus.) Rand Paul cannot surge because he is not adding anything, and his attitude does not lend well to surging. 

As of now Rand Paul is pulling stunts to get people to notice him, burning the tax code, a while ago filibustering, confrontation with Trump, all of which has failed. 

And his debate performance was terrible. Seriously, he confronted *Chris Christie*  on the **NSA spy program** and lost. I personally found it hilarious how Rand Paul lost a exchange over a topic from a position that is not only extremely easy to defend, but the **core idea in his entire plan.** He should have known enough, and he does (the filibuster), to win that exchange, but he did not. He instead comes across as immature.

And besides, his entire goal was to somehow combine a libertarian base with republican policies to create an electable libertarian. And the way he has gone about doing that is incredibly stupid (being opposed to gay marriage, **as a libertarian**, makes absolutely no sense. Even if you do oppose gay marriage, it still should not sit well.) And he make his case on gay marriage to early, so all he did was turn away libertarians, who realized how little sense this platform made, and for republicans, the **actual issue of gay marriage does not matter anymore, the issue of religious freedom with relation to gay marriage does** and the topic of judicial activism.

*Both* of those things he should really strong with, judicial activism and religious freedom, but he is not because he went early and adopted a stupid platform and made himself irrelevant. And this is not just true with social issues, but economic issues as well. Rand Paul has not defined himself economically, he has simply said, the tax code is to long!, we a paying money to countries that hate us!, balance budgets! The latter is a position that is fairly popular, but there are candidates who are not simply saying it but have actually done it (Kasich), the first is popular but candidates have an actual tax plan forward (Jeb Bush), and the second is populist rhetoric that makes sense and may be good to implement, but it not really an issue (you can't balance the budget by cutting foreign aid, foreign aid is extremely low.)

And he is an isolationist, when we have been bombarded with news of ISIS coming, so ... 

And he pretty much advocated for cutting foreign aid to Israel in the debate. Which pisses of any pro-Isreal republican, which there are a lot, and there are a lot of pro-Isreal democrats. 

So basically he has managed to piss everyone off, comes across as immature, spouts the same points over and over again because he gave his platform early, and as result of doing that, large portions have quickly become irrelevant, he is unable to adapt to support things he should be strong in, and cannot even defend his strongest idea against a sub-par debater in a debate.

A lot of the Ron Paul supporters who were in college when he first ran are now in their late 20s, with 5+ years in corporate America, and have decided that maybe completely unregulated capitalism isn't as swell as it sounds. 

And while in a different year, this crop of late 20s libertarian defectors might get replaced with a new batch of college students eager to support a libertarian challenging the establishment, I'd argue that this time around, Bernie Sanders is actually getting the support of just about everyone who wants to see a big shakeup in the system. While some will say that it's ridiculous that there would be any overlap between a libertarian and a socialist, in this case I disagree. I think a lot of young people, especially the redditor types, just view the system as unfair, and believe that *something* is conspiring to keep entrenched interests at the top at their expense. In 2008 Ron Paul was the voice of a populist revolution to overhaul the system, but in 2015, Bernie is that voice. While they may approach the problem from very different angles, they both give their supporters the feeling that they're supporting a true populist rather than a corporate politician.  With Bernie filling that space, Rand is left very little opportunity to build any grassroots excitement among the young populist crowd, especially after he tried softening his views to appease the Fox News crowd. Now he just sounds significantly less ""authentic"" than both his father and Bernie sanders. 

It will be interesting to see if someone like Justin Amash can rekindle the libertarian flame in the future.
