cvaxlpw,1,t3_3m04vl,steelerfaninperu,"ELI5 is pretty tough here, but let me throw out a possible explanation that shouldn't be too hard.

Latino immigration (not just Mexican) fills jobs that native people wouldn't otherwise go after. There are almost always minimum wage jobs available due to high rotation, so first off the immigrants aren't ""taking"" anyone's job or cutting your pay.

What you do get is a massive new influx of customers. Immigrants still need to buy coffee, wash their clothes, fix their shoddy electrical work, and so on and so forth. 

What that means is more business for everybody else at the bottom  end. The grocery store might have to hire another cashier, the McDonalds may need an extra assistant manager, etc.. Thus immigrants, as customers, create jobs for native workers. 

That increase in jobs also creates an increase in competition for legal, legitimate workers, and competition will eventually push salaries higher, even if its slight. ",6,0,1442974666,1444725211
cvaughx,1,t3_3m04vl,CompactedConscience,"Someone is going to be able to give a better answer than this, but I'll post something in the meantime. 

Economists are always trying to do more and better empirical work and the theory hasn't always caught up yet. The shortest answer to your question might be that we just don't know why immigrants have the measurable positive impact on income that they have.

There are explanations you can come up with that are consistent with economic theory. I am just not sure if we know which ones are the most correct. The most plausible (but unspecific) answer that I have seen is ""general equilibrium"". Letting in immigrants has some second and third and fourth (and so on) order effects. The cheap labor might, for example, drive economic growth through a variety of channels that then puts upwards pressure on wages. The immigrants also spend money which could operate through different channels to the same end. In other words, the net beneficial effect of immigration might come from a complicated series of events that can't easily be explained to a five year old.",3,0,1442969072,1444725211

cvawwux,1,t3_3m04vl,kulturkampf,"I disagree with the initial premise that it is a proven thing that Mexican immigration benefits the wages of native workers at all. 

Perhaps it helps eliminate the lowest paying jobs and thus 1/3 of US adults remain without work because there is no work, thus those who are working tend to only have higher wages, lol. Perhaps this is a mere statistical fluke.",3,0,1442973440,1444725211

cvb4xzd,1,t3_3m04vl,cdstephens,"The gist of it is that most immigrants tend to not displace the jobs of native workers, but instead find employment in jobs that native workers aren't doing for one reason or another. Immigrants also create businesses which in turn creates jobs, and working class immigrants tend to spend most of their paycheck as they get it for living expenses. The increased spending is good for the economy.

I suppose intuitively, immigrants would have a similar effect on the economy as a population increase. One is not inherently worried that a greater population due to birth rates means that there will be less jobs to go around since younger people are stealing jobs from older people. There are of course costs associated with immigrants such as assimilation, language barriers, and the like that a native-born citizen would not accrue. But the simple ""stealing our jobs"" argument seems to neglect that the job market is fluid, and the demand for employees is constantly changing.",1,0,1442993459,1444725215
