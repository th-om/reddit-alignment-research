3l74wj,Carly Fiorina called the GOP/Republican party the party of women's suffrage. Do you find this misleading?,39,molotoviphone,"For reference(couldn't find it on youtube easily) - http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/mika-on-fiorina-face-ad--that-is-how-you-do-it-525784131774

While it is true that the 19th amendment was passed primarily by the Republican Party and opposed through votes and filibuster by the Democratic party, the parties have almost completely changed orientation. 

Whereas the Republican party that backed Lincoln made progressive changes such as the 3 amendments tied to the Civil War, as well as woman's suffrage and other rights, today's Republican leadership generally take a stance against women's rights (the right to choose). The democratic party leadership gravitates towards backing civil rights for LGBT citizens(see Clinton and Sanders) versus the opposite position in the GOP(see most of the candidates on the GOP side, especially Huckabee and Cruz). 

Whether or not you support today's ideologically right Republican Party or today's ideologically left Democratic Party, it is clear that the Republican party has migrated from the left to the right, and the democratic party has migrated from the right to the left. 

Do you see statements such as Carly Fiorina's that site a party's history without any ideological context misleading?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l74wj/carly_fiorina_called_the_goprepublican_party_the/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442425737,1444727837
