Well, you should read what some of the other candidates write and say outside the debate (for example, [here](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-08-04/restoring-america-s-strength) is a piece by Marco Rubio advocating much the same thing). They're pretty much all on board with that (so is Hillary). Also, Obama created a rapid response force (supplementary to an earlier one created under Bush) of 5000 soldiers to more or less patrol NATO's eastern border. He also recently put heavy military equipment in the Baltics. 

Also, the ""rebuilding"" of the 6th fleet which she suggested is only necessary because of the sequester. Had that not occurred, the military build up she's suggesting wouldn't be necessary because our spending would have never dropped.",6,0,1442939649,1444725375
