For example, many politicians and writers do the ""SNAP challenge.""  Some politicians were dumb and spent a dollar on a single egg.  Other writers were able to do a week's worth of shopping and have money to spare.  Who was right?",1,0,1443359735,1444723199
cvfm31n,0,t1_cvfjk25,ISBUchild,"No, because the weekly/monthly budget, the raw numbers of being poor, aren't what suck. You can live - not that well - on minimum wage. Food isn't terribly expensive, rent can be split, etc.

What is terrifying about poverty, having been there, is the uncertainty, and the knowledge that a slight breeze can knock your life over at any moment. It's not so much the things that cost $1000/yr that kill you, it's the things that cost $10,000 but have a 1/10 chance of occurring. That could be a medical emergency, liability for damages in a car accident, etc. It's not eating cheap beans every day that hurts, it's knowing the slightest financial disturbance can get you evicted faster than you can make it up. Poor people can often pay their regular bills, but have no buffer for surprises, and can't build meaningful wealth. That feeling of hopelessness builds and you start to question why you even bother.

Experiencing the low living standards of a poor person for a week, even a month, doesn't give you that fear and depression. ",22,0,1443339613,1444723199
cvfvkgp,0,t1_cvfm31n,Divio42,"Even beyond worrying about that 1/10 chance of a catastrophic issue occuring problems build up over the course of months and years that people often put off because they can't afford to address them only to have them become exponentially worse as time goes on. 

One example: Dental issues seem to be a very prominent issue I've seen with poor people. It starts as a tooth ache that they just deal with because they don't have dental insurance and can't afford a dentist. Over the course of a few years the tooth rots out. Other teeth get messed up. They develop full blown periodontal disease. A couple hundred dollar fix turns into $10k-$20k unless they just get their whole mouth ripped out. The entire time they are dealing with this they are in a constant pain that they just learn to endure and deal with but it still impacts their state of mind.

There are so many other issues along those lines that can occur. No temporary poor experience could possibly convey how difficult it is and, as another person who replied here said, if anything it may gave the exact opposite impression.",3,0,1443370804,1444723199

I'd like to add that I think this would actually have the *opposite* effect the OP thinks it would; living in ""poverty"" as opposed to **poverty** would give them a false understanding of what poor people go through.

But you say an idea of ""poverty"" might make it worse -- I counter that politicians currently have an idea of poverty that's even worse than the ""poverty"" we're talking about. They might never get to understand **poverty**, but isn't a vague understanding of ""poverty"" still better than what we've got now? You could even add in an education project to hammer home the point that actual poverty is what you describe.

I strongly believe there has to be some effort made to explain to our politicians what poverty is like. Doing nothing or very little, like now, isn't enough, and some idea of ""poverty"" is still better than nothing imo. What would you do instead?",1,0,1443377800,1444723203

The same can't be said of the poor. Paul Ryan's ""front-line"" battle on poverty didn't have testimony from a single poor person... I would be incredibly surprised if a commission on CEO salaries went without the testimony of several CEOs. Politicians are already told how hard it is to be rich.",1,0,1443378028,1444723203

Second of all the president makes many decisions that affects the poor it wouldn't hurt for them to have a week of experience in their shoes as a reference point.

Third, having empathy doesn't make a leader weak. Yes being poor is associated with having bad values and decision making but only if you equate a good life to the amount of money you have. There's plenty of good poor people and plenty have bad poor people. Same goes for the rich.

cvg3oi3,0,t1_cvfz6gt,Bassoon_Commie,"> Being poor is associated with having bad values and decision making

Maybe there's a correlation, but having bad values doesn't necessarily cause poverty. Look at Carly Fiorina if you don't believe me.

And I would say it's good for a leader to know what weakness is. Reminds them of their mortality and their ability to make mistakes, reminds them they're not infallible. It's a check to their ego and a way for them to double-check and ensure they're protecting those without power- because now they might understand what it's like to be powerless.",1,0,1443383358,1444723207

cvfp4vf,1,t3_3mjns9,Snedeker,"I think that there is some merit in having politicians with different life experiences. Many politicians will go out of their way to stress their humble upbringings, so having a politician who has experienced poverty isn't quite as rare as you may be portraying.

I personally think that there are other situations that a politician should experience that are at least as important as poverty. A politician should have some experience serving in the military. A politician should have had a job outside of government at one point in their lives. A politician should have successfully run a business. A politician should have had children. A politician should have a deeply held religious faith. A politician should be able to speak another language, and have lived outside of the Unites States for a period of time.

It's unlikely that any one person would have all of these qualifications, but the more different experiences that they have the better. Experiencing poverty probably is useful, but it is not uniquely so.",-1,0,1443354111,1444723211
