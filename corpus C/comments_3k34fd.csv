What I love is the logic behind the statements...

Less services strengthens the economy, you see if the roads and basic infrastructure go to shit, it helps the economy! If workers get help with education, or can find cheap daycare for their kids, that hurts employers! 

Rich people create jobs! It's true! They may be in China, but damnit, they create jobs!

We need a strong military! Russia could invade! Be Afraid! China! China will totally attack their biggest customer! It could happen! 

Conservative ideas rarely look good in the first sentence because they're full of !@#$. You need all the explanation to confuse people.....",5,0,1441735079,1444731626

cuuqgn7,0,t1_cuudq38,genebeam,"> A conservative says to lower government spending. That means less services, so he has to explain that it will strengthen the economy and also mean less need for services. A conservative says to cut taxes on the rich. They already have money, so he needs to explain that the rich person will invest it creating more businesses.

Except no political cartoon frontloads an issue like that, including liberally biased ones. It's just bad form. Political cartoons aren't issue advocacy, they're highlighting hypocrisy or ironies or a new angle on a situation.

The need to cut government spending is the premise of a ton of political cartoons.
