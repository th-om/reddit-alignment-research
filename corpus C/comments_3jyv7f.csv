The media is not simply journalists or ""knowledge institutions"". The media is a group of corporations owned by a small group of conglomerates that have investments across multiple industries. Inherently, this requires certain biases: it requires a heavy capitalist bias since a corporate media system will not undermine itself because power is not suicidal. The next bias, ask how the media make money. Do they make money off reporting or do they make off advertising. They make nearly all their money (a huge huge huge supermajority) from advertising. This means you have to make a medium that is friendly to corporate interests--you can't for example openly undermine the capitalist system or business or the economic system itself and its inherent politics.

Well what about reporters? Well reporters operate within this structure: a capitalist corporate media system that prefers a bias towards business, against labour, and for the associated social and political which foster this. Be a journalist as long as you follow this and if you don't, you won't get far. No one is actively gonna suppress you--that doesn't exist--but why would a system of power promote ideas that undermine it. The people who go far as journalists are by and large embodying the core assumptions of the system and will--rightly say ""no one tells me what to say"" because if they did, they wouldn't be in that position.

So going back to the liberal point, you could argue that even though the system by simple logic requires a capitalist bias that there is some sinister liberal agenda--even though liberals don't control the actual economic and power structure of the news, somehow they create a bias. Well what is a liberal--in America.

A liberal assumes a state capitalist system is ideal. They assume a business oriented society is ideal and want some form of regulation on elements that might turn anti labor. They are generally not shy about supporting violence or if they do view it as an abberation of the system. Generally they share the assumptions necessary by a corporate media to participate in it.

So going back to that, I just find the point ridiculous.

If you think journalists run media, you think factory workers control General Motors. The product of news media is viewers, they sell audiences to advertisers to make money. News is secondary. They will be the first to tell you this. The constraints of advertising appeal require certain types of appeal (within the corporate system). By and large, journalists share most if not all assumptions of the people who actually run news corporations which also own weapon companies, energy companies, industry, etc.

So you can bloviate on and on about how the evil capitalist leadership will never let them speak an ill word about corporations and capitalism, but you'd be *demonstrably* wrong.  Negative press sells, and *that's* what the evil capitalist media empire owners care about.  There might not be a word of bad press about the media companies themselves, but every other business participant in every other industry is fair game... except for government.  They can't talk *too* much shit about the government, otherwise they'll be blackballed from meaningful press events, and thus, give their competitors a leg up on the story, on more eyeballs, and on more ad revenue.

>Do they make money off reporting or do they make off advertising.

When you can figure out a way to make money on reporting without resorting to advertising, you're welcome to give it a try.  WSJ, NYT, and many, *many* other publications tried.  Consumers don't pay for it, and something *has* to, because there is no such thing as a free lunch.

>Well what about reporters? Well reporters operate within this structure: a capitalist corporate media system that prefers a bias towards business, against labour, and for the associated social and political which foster this. Be a journalist as long as you follow this and if you don't, you won't get far.

Right, that's why Keith Olbermann, Rachel Maddow, Ed Schulz, Chris Matthews, Paul Krugman, Jessica Valenti, Arianna Huffington, and a spate of others have their own media soapboxes in which they espouse the very ideas that you argue are horribly censored by the mainstream media.  Your conspiracy theory that those at the top are keeping a tight lid on any and all anti-capitalist, anti-business rhetoric?  Laughable.  

Brian L. Roberts is the CEO of Comcast, one of ""The Big Six"" (media companies that control everything), wrote a letter to Barack Obama endorsing the Affordable Care Act and donated much more to Democrats than he did to Republicans ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_L._Roberts#Politics)).  Bob Iger of The Walt Disney Company has donated much more to Democrats than he has to Republicans ([source](http://www.opensecrets.org/usearch/index.php?q=Robert+Iger&cx=010677907462955562473%3Anlldkv0jvam&cof=FORID%3A11&searchButt.x=40&searchButt.y=12)).  The ""TV, Movies, and Music"" interest group on OpenSecrets donates overwhelmingly more to Democrats than to Republicans ([source](http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=B02)).

By what objective measure is your ranty conspiracy theory to be taken as truth?  NO number support you.  Not even the ""But the executives!"" appeal carries any weight here, since by any objective measure, the *only* executive who's openly right-wing is Rupert Murdoch -- and then, you *knew* Rupert Murdoch's name AND his political affiliation.  Why don't you know that about the other media companies, especially the two that are considerably larger than his media empire ([source](http://investmentwatchblog.com/only-six-corporations-own-all-mainstream-media-in-the-united-states/))?

>So going back to the liberal point, you could argue that even though the system by simple logic requires a capitalist bias that there is some sinister liberal agenda--even though liberals don't control the actual economic and power structure of the news, somehow they create a bias. Well what is a liberal--in America.

Right... still not invalidating my point.

>If you think journalists run media...

I don't.  I think Liberals do.  The Liberal journalists dutifully do their part, although I don't think it's some great, active conspiracy by Liberals for the most part.  I do think that there is a worrying amount of subtle censorship of conservatives both in the news media, and in academia - although I would say the level of willfulness of censorship is much, much, higher in academia.  I think most journalists do their jobs, and try to be objective -- we can only regulate our own biases so much.

Professors in American college/university, though?  They're openly hateful of conservatives, to the extent that they brag about it and no one calls them on it.",0,0,1441695802,1444731952
cuu8eac,0,t1_cuu7n92,Vittgenstein,"First point, you didn't even read my first sentence correctly. I said *on the floor* as in the production line. Pontificate about metaphysics all you want, my point is that if you aspect of an organic entity is Maoist, the entity is not. If I said all workers, you would be correct but I didn't, read it again. The floor is the production line, a basic concept for a mind such as yours ruminating the nature of organic and inorganic entities and their ideologies. 

Second point: does the NYT, the ""liberal bastion"" condemn capitalism and the corporation as an entity in our society? No. WSJ? Atlantic? LA Times? Boston Globe? No. Do they lambast individual corporations, yes. Incompetence and corruption are waste of resources in a corporate system, they got that point or criticize perceived ones all within the confines of accepting the standard assumptions.

Find me some editorials where the paper is on its editorial board, linked to corporate management, condemns capitalism or the corporation or the nation state or the market or any basic assumption of capitalism which suits it's arrangement.

About your point on ""evil capitalist"" I never stated there was any conscious effort. Your very first paragraph was that 

>If every worker in Ford subscribed to the same ideology, you're arguing that the metaphysical concept known as a company, whose actions are dictated by physical entities that would make it up, wouldn't be the same ideology?

You agree with me. A capitalist system will by its nature be composed of those who agree with capitalism, it's not a conspiracy theory. If I said some board censored them, it would be. It's just common sense, you grow and learn in a capitalist society that it's the best ideology or one to draw from. Just like an egalitarian society would have those values instilled without question. Just like, as you said, the fact is that physical entities and ideologies and metaphysics of the corporation are related. You're just screaming and unwilling to apply your own words to the media system, as I stated in my last result. It's a lack of critical thinking which is a shame because you seem to be able to create exotic arguments that are sound if you ignore basic facts.

I encourage you to learn how the news industry works and makes money, there is nothing wrong with being wrong. The majority of all profits are advertising not sales. It's nearly 20 billion in ad revenue, another 10 from digital ads. Papers are not condemning capitalism or corporation as an entity, criticizing specific corporations doesn't kill revenue. It's as simple as that.

On your point about the government. You are right but missing a few things. Yes, they rely on sources and this creates a narrative usually favorable to government interests since they are not going to--usually--go out of their way to leak things which make them look negative. Similar for business, doubly so since business is a source of revenue.

Now for advertising, again the undisputed source of revenue to anyone who is familiar with news industry--not sales--important is environment AND demographic appeal. Advertisers are sold audiences, newspapers have different audiences. The NYT different from NYT from Boston Globe from Atlantic, you get the point. So a positive environment for investment and a strong demographic appeal.

Now you yourself stated, in the first paragraph, it's ridiculous to assume a group of the same ideology will not affect any larger metaphysical groups: a family, corporation, etc. So for the NYT key demographic, the ""political class"" which is usually college educated, either in politics or policy, and academia and news making, an appeal to them would require a capitalist bias which I'm talking about. 

Now this isn't a big bad conspiracy theory, it's an idea you yourself were willing to throw at me when you misread my sentence but refuse to accept the implications of. Interesting.

Next point: the news papers you named all are some of the biggest money generators for advertising, what are you on about? In fact their experiments were retrospectively failures which is why the have never left their traditional model in any serious form.

Next point: I just honestly think you don't care to read what I say. I stated you get to the top as a journalist by following the assumptions.

1) those you just named are by and large BROADCASTERS 
2) they again share the basic assumptions for the most part about capitalism and the corporation being ideal or desirable. Those you named specifically tirade against specific ones that give grievances but are fine with the market system and are fine with corporate personhood and rights for the most part. 
3) as I stated above, but I'm surprised you didn't point out--but there are exceptions. For example, The Nation itself or the Independent we could go on for days. Doesn't really change anything, you want to go far in the journalist world by and large you are assuming and sharing the basic assumptions about the system. You're honestly dense if you think I said anywhere--I made it clear no such thing existed--there is some censorship or some leadership. It's a system that works itself.

Is our society suddenly going to have anti egalitarian leaders everywhere? No. Why? For the same reason we have capitalist reporters and heads of media--these are ideas we accept de jure--the default ideology, the implicit basis for our society. I am just confused why you are so quick to accept this to dismember the Ford example--despite misreading it--but refuse to apply it to the media.

Next point: And? Are they undermining the corporation or capitalism? They supported a privatized mandated health care marketplace law put forward by a President who ideologically is more conservative than the Nelson Rockefeller, the socially liberal and fiscally conservative Republican governor of NY that dominated politics for a short while and defined a phase of Republican politics.

If the ACA was a single payer system you would have a weak point but a more serious one that didn't sound like rattling off talking points instead of political discussion. It's not a liberal law by any measure, it does nothing to challenge the fundamental assumption that government should not use buying power to negotiate lower prices or provide care--which keeps it safely conservative (this was after all a plan put forward by conservatives for many years in the past anyways).

Last point: I've been on mobile so I can't source as I would like to but I can assure you I'll add some edits with basic sources for you that help you see the points. As for your final point, so let me get this right.

When I use your point, it's a conspiracy theory. I am saying censorship by big bad capitalists and that's wrong because even though--as you pointed out--an ideology adopted by a system implies that it's participants accept it generally and vice versa, really this is just laughable rhetoric. But there exists a subtle censorship of conservatives for the same reason: the general ideas adopted are liberal so they work against conservatives. It's nonsense, you're contradicting yourself thrice over to make a weak point. Laughable! 

I'll add the edits in a few hours when I'm finally home if that suits you, would you be above watching a simple video on the subject accompanying the sources? ",4,0,1441698668,1444731952
