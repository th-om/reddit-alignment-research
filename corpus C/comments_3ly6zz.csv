**So bear in mind that it is the government that attempts to stop very ill US citizens from purchasing a much needed medicine for less money by buying it abroad. If the pharmaceutical industry were a truly free market, Pyrimethamine would be available for less than a dollar a pill for everyone.  ONLY the government stands in the way of that.**
**End Edit**
***************************
Everyone was complaining about the CEO that raised the price of Toxoplasmosis medicine Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 per pill (people are calling it an ""HIV Med"" in social media and elsewhere because that sounds more sympathetic.  That's the same as calling a pneumonia med an ""HIV med"" since pneumonia is a common HIV-related illness just like toxoplasmosis).  They're saying that the price hike is a good example of how the ""free market"" is pure evil and ""just doesn't work""... well as per usual, those people just don't see the big picture and have deeply misunderstood the parts they do see.


First of all, the pharmaceutical industry is not a free market by any stretch of the imagination.  A free market would be an almost perfectly contestable market.  A perfectly contestable market has three main traits... no barriers to entry, no sunk costs, and universal access to the same technology for new firms as well as existing firms.  The pharmaceutical industry is actually a perfect example of the EXACT OPPOSITE of a contestable market.


And all of those barriers to entry, sunk costs, and disparities in the level of technology among firms exist because of the actions of government regulators.


Here's the big surprise though, the one thing that I don't think many people who voiced their anger over this issue realize: The patent for Pyrimethamine (the medicine of brand name Daraprim) EXPIRED... years ago.


Which means: anyone, anywhere can make all the Pyrimethamine they want and sell it for whatever price they want. ""Why don't they then?"", you may be asking. Well... because the government regulators have turned the pharma industry into a non-contestable market, so no new firms can get into it, and the existing firms don't think making Pyrimethamine is worth their time since the number of people who take it is so low, and...wait for it... the price was originally so low (when it was $13.50 per pill).


However, and this is my favorite part... like I said, the CEO of the company that owns Daraprim will now be lowering the price because of all the outrage.


Guess what would have happened if Turing Pharmaceuticals kept its price at $750 per pill? It would have created an economic incentive for other companies to actually start manufacturing Pyrimethamine, and that new competition would have most likely LOWERED the price dramatically... probably to well below what the CEO will now lower it to.


And so, once again, overbearing government has screwed consumers and sick people... and stuck the free market with the blame.  But if this were a truly free market... the approximately 2,000 people who will likely be prescribed Pyrimethamine could just buy the medicine online from the UK for only $20 for 30 pills (which is like .66 cents each).  However, the government will not allow those sick, possibly dying people to buy their medicine that way.

In my world, it would be the consumers choice. A smart consumer would not take an unapproved  drug except in special cases where death or suffering was certain anyway. The point is that consumers would have the choice where they do not have that choice now.
