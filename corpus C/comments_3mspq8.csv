cvi2g04,0,t1_cvht1el,IUhoosier_KCCO,"> but it's a pretty good look at how single payer systems would bankrupt almost all state governments.

eh vermont's problem was that their healthcare system really wasn't *true* single-payer. they certainly tried to make it like single-payer. but that is impossible when you grant exemptions to certain groups of people/businesses paying in. add to that the fact that a single-payer state system can't work alongside a federal system. that, by definition, means there is more than 1 payer. 

at the end of the day, however, 50 single payer systems in the US would not work well. we need 1 that is run by the federal govt.",0,0,1443535535,1444722491

cvicee9,0,t1_cvicbvc,TehRoot,"> Two factors explain most of the decline in the plan's financial prospects. First, the anticipated federal revenues from Medicaid and the ACA declined dramatically. Second, Shumlin's policy choices significantly increased the total projected cost of Green Mountain Care: raising the actuarial value of coverage — the expected portion of medical costs covered by a plan rather than by out-of-pocket spending — from 87% to 94%, providing coverage to nonresidents working in Vermont, and eliminating current state taxes on medical providers. Still, even Shumlin's projections indicated that the plan would reduce Vermont's overall health spending and lower costs for the 90% of Vermont families with household incomes under $150,000. Despite differing projections, all three studies showed that single payer was economically feasible.

>Asking the legislature to approve a new 11.5% payroll tax on employers and income taxes on households as high as 9.5% to finance Green Mountain Care would have increased the size of Vermont's 2015 state budget, set at $5.6 billion, by 45%. Even though the taxes would have replaced private insurance premiums that employers and individuals currently pay, and even though the Internal Revenue Service had agreed that the taxes would be federally deductible, in political terms it would have been a mammoth increase that would have been glaringly evident on every Vermonter's tax bill, unlike employer-based health insurance premiums, which most workers fail to notice.

What I find the most difficult for single payer is the U.S. healthcare system. We've used it for so long and gotten accustomed to it that such a drastic change, like single-payer, is going to result in years of bumpy road. I have no doubt in my mind that once it stablizes and people get used to the change it will never go away but the question is if the U.S. would ever allow it to get that far.
