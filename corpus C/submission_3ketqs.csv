3ketqs,"To those who see what Kim Davis is doing as civil disobedience, a question: Would it be civil disobedience if the president refused to obey the law?",82,CaspianX2,"For example's sake, let's say that Congress has declared war on a hostile enemy but the president, citing his staunch religious position as a pacifist, outright refuses to bring America to battle, even as the US comes under attack.

The Supreme Court has issued him an order to either carry out the duties of his post, or permit the Vice President to act in his place, but the President counters that it is unconstitutional that he be forced to do something against his beliefs, nor allow someone else to do so in his place.

Is this an act of civil disobedience?",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ketqs/to_those_who_see_what_kim_davis_is_doing_as_civil/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441898664,1444730442
