Also, when schools don't teach politics and instead the students are taught at home, most of them end up mirroring the political views of their parents.

In a comment you mention common core as something you don't like. That's certainly a controversial thing so you aren't alone in disliking it. But what is it exactly about common core that you dislike? And how do you know the aspects of your education that you don't like are the result of common core as opposed to any of the many other factors that go into teaching?

Any other gripes other than common core?",2,0,1443326995,1444723241
cvfuwie,0,t1_cvfhvgs,RedditDevil2,"The thing I hate about common core, is that they don't even tell you you're in common core until you get the material. You seem reasonable, so I'm going to say that this is my first year in a public school at all, because previous to that I'd been in a private school where everything was a lot better. But in public schools, all I've noticed is that we don't actually learn. I don't know if this is just my school or not, but it really does feel like the teachers are just there too give you the notes you need in order to pass the next test. We don't LEARN. We regurgitate facts that we've memorized and studied. The teachers don't even try sometimes. It makes me fed up and want to give up entirely because I no longer see a point other than just trying to get out. About common core though, it treats you like a five year old, but makes the material so much more complicated than it should be. There seems to be one big flaw in all of it though, and it feels more like schools think making things harder will make a student better at getting good grades. It makes no sense, no sense at all. A few of my teachers that do try to teach us, tell us it is our own responsibility to give ourselves an education. I want to agree with that, but then I also can't agree with that. Most of us are required to go somewhere we don't want to be, and those of us who might be interested in learning might try, but you really can't depend on us to give ourselves an education. That's honestly the best way I can explain it. My mind is so foggy that I can't even explain what my main gripes are very well, and I apologize for that. I know I could explain it much better, but when I'm away from school I always forget what my complaints are, and I just know that there's a huge hunch in my stomach that something is wrong with the school system and maybe even the world around us? I know that sounds cliche and over-used but I guarantee it's true.

Here's one of my gripes I can explain well:
I hate how they only prepare us for test.
Like I said before, they should prepare us for more . There should be classes that teach people about mental disorders and more important things like safety that teach you things from what to do if you were to be bitten by a snake to the best thing to do if you were in a situation that could be life threatening. These types of classes should instead be orchestrated into the school system, because they would be so much better and more interesting. If you can get the students to interact with their education, they would learn more if that makes any sense.
And even when they do have these classes, they aren't required classes, but they should be. That's one of my biggest gripes. 
Again if any of this is not making sense it's because my mind isn't very clear as of right now. I think I got a little carried away too, and I'm also sorry for that. 
I think my mind isn't clear  because I'm not used to people actually wanting to hear my complaining about the school system. Other than my parents and some of my friends, most people will just brush me off like it's nothing when I ask questions about it. Including teachers. I ask real questions about the world outside of the school sometimes and they always just tell me that it isn't what we're going over and continue with the lesson. I can sort of understand that reasoning though. Sort of, anyway. ",1,0,1443369569,1444723241
