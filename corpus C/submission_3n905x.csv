>The president chastised gun-rights groups, such as the National Rifle Association (NRA), which helped stymie his previous effort to enact stronger federal gun laws following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The proposed changes included expanded background checks and bans on assault weapons

>""How can you, with a straight face, make the case that more guns will make us safer?‚Äù he asked. 

I guess the answer would be that if a responsible gun owner is sitting in the room, they may be able to return fire when the gunman kills the first person and not the 10th. That some guy won't have to charge him unarmed and catch 7 bullets in order to stop him.

In fact, it seems the President should understand exactly how his military, how the police, how his own body guards use guns to make us safer.

While I appreciate the president's passion and desire for action - It seems to me his logic is as flawed as possible. The president, in his anger, opened a very large can of hyperbole in his press conference and made many more accusations. You should read it or listen. Does this approach win him more support? I see hypocrisy in this statement, and I would love to hear someone explain to me why I am wrong.
