cvl7g1a,1,t3_3n4w6b,BrawnyJava,"I hadn't heard about it, but the left likes to beat up WalMart for anything.  The real problem is that Mexico allows this, not that WalMart goes along with local laws.  WalMart has no obligation other than obey the law.  If the prevailing wage for grocery baggers is tips, that's what you pay them. If GM had to pay UAW rates in Mexico, there'd be no auto manufacturing in Mexico, and no cheap economy cars in the US.  GM can't make money on small cars in the US.",3,0,1443748746,1444720972

I remember them being criticized for [paying employees in vouchers, redeemable at Walmart](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122066524815506105), and for [bribing public figures](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/18/business/walmart-bribes-teotihuacan.html?pagewanted=all).

cvlqebu,0,t1_cvkulcn,chitwin,And if they would have done this every bagger at other stores would have wanted to get paid. Probably putting 5 hose stores out of business. Then the headline would have been that walmart was driving Mexican businesses out. It's really a no win situation for them they will be attacked either way. ,1,0,1443798810,1444720972
cvkycx7,1,t3_3n4w6b,djm19,"Because Walmart is an objectively wealthy company that can afford to pay actual wages to its employees. Also if you are asking why people responded the way they did, it's because they don't know that this happens at some Mexican markets and that was not information presented. Regardless it does not mean they support markets doing that either.",3,0,1443733235,1444720972
