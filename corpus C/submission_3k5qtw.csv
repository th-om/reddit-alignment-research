3k5qtw,"It's up to you folks, the Boomers are driving.",117,JohnnyBeagle,"Hi, I'm 60 years old.  I was born in 1955, the last official year of the ""Boomers"".  

When my Dad was 82, I forced him to give up his driver's license.  He had Parkinson's and had fallen asleep at the wheel more than once due to medication side affects.  He protested, but eventually gave in.  He died at 84.  I forced my Mom to give up her license at 88, even though she only drove a few miles each week.  She mentioned to  me that she was experiencing ""double vision"" at times but knew which oncoming car was the real one.  

Today, my father-in-law is 95.  He's got poor eyesight and refuses to wear his glasses.  He has poor hearing and turns his hearing aids off to save the batteries.  He's got poor reflexes.  He's driving, maybe in your state.   

The rules & regulations state to state vary and the elderly vote....but if you are reading this post, I am asking you to press your legislatures for a stricter policy on elderly drivers. 

Personally, I plan to quit driving entirely when I am 75, if not sooner.  I love to drive.  I'm an excellent driver (yeah,  'Course, three minutes to Wapner.) but I've decided to be proactive.  Most of my generation will not.  


It's up to you.  We're coming, and we're driving a potentially deadly weapon.  ",99,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3k5qtw/its_up_to_you_folks_the_boomers_are_driving/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441755035,1444731410
