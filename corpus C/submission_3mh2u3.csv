3mh2u3,How close are we to a WW3 than we were during the Cuban missile crisis and Cold War?,25,lakalia,"So I have been having a lot of anxiety lately when I read the news. It seems everything I read makes us an inch close to world war 3. For example: today I read the U.S. And Russia are getting ready for ""hybrid warfare"" with the U.S. at th baltics. Apparently they have thought of nuclear weapons to be used for this but not sure. Then I have read that China would be upset if we have a failing stock market. Then we have this refugee crisis like we did before ww3. Now then I have been reading prophecies from various ""prophets"" and they claim we will have a ww3 around right now too. I know that sounds really stuff but it's my anxiety. Anyways I'm asking this questions because on political forums everyone keeps freaking out and saying we are like an inch away from an all out war. But what I was wondering is - was it just as bad during the Cold War and Missile crisis? I'm trembling. Here's the article that made me break down http://www.rt.com/news/316557-us-hybrid-war-russia-baltics/
Now I understand that prophecies aren't to be taken seriously but the ones I have hear freaked me the fuck out. Like I said, I'm having an irrational fear and since I am young I would like someone with knowledge to explain these scenarios. I feel like technology is making everyone think every little thing will start a war. But anyways, thank you all in advanced",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mh2u3/how_close_are_we_to_a_ww3_than_we_were_during_the/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443281945,1444723394
