It's sort of like the reason why we get the ACA instead of single payer even with the Democratic caucus having a veto proof majority in the Senate; because some of the Blue Dog democrats were never going to vote for single payer.  If the Democratic majority had been large enough that they could have allowed those defections and still passed a bill, it probably would have been a lot more progressive.

That said, McConnell has already come out against the idea of forcing a shutdown over the issue, and i expect Boehner to cave as well.  He may lose the House leadership over it (and maybe even his seat), but the business interests that fund the GOP and don't want a shutdown will ensure he has a cushy lobbyist job waiting for him.",0,0,1441817225,1444731220

cuwar8d,1,t3_3k9d1v,CUDawg30,Republicans do not control the Executive Branch which has the power of veto. The Republicans do not have a super-majority in Congress so they must work with the Democratic members and the Democratic President to pass compromised budgets to fund the Federal government. Just because the Republicans control the majority doesn't mean they have the power to pass whatever they want and have it become the law of the land.

They choose hot-button ""moral"" issues like gay rights and abortion because they don't have *ideas* to run on that would be appealing to their constituents.  

Planned Parenthood might as well have been picked out of a hat, and will exist as an ""issue"" to be dealt with for exactly as long as their constituents remain interested.
