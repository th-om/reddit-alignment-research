3mmbcq,Best and Worst Presidential Canidates that are currently running thus far?,23,dickwhitman69,"Best(G.O.P.) John Kasich without a doubt, he is not only the most qualified, but he is actually willing to work with the other side of the aisle, which is what we need the G.O.P. to do if we are to expect anything to change in this country.

Worst(G.O.P.) Donald Trump without a doubt, this guy is completely shameless, classless, crazy and has no viable experience what so ever.  The man can build a hell of a golf course for whatever that is worth.  Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are shills as well, but even they don't quite match up to the Donald's incompetency, even though they are completely unqualified to do the job.     

Best(Democrats)- Bernie Sanders, has the experience, (Senior member of the Senate Budge Committee), the passion, and frankly a vision that addresses a lot of important issues in this country, i.e. Climate Change, Infrastructure, income inequality and what have you.  

Worst(Democrats)- Probably Martin O'Malley just because of his time as Mayor of Baltimore, he did not really do as much as he should of for the impoverished people in that City. I understand his hands were tied, but deescalating not escalating the War on Drugs would have been much more beneficial to the City imo.
