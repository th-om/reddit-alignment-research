cv0f4ut,1,t3_3ktqzh,ge93,"badecon discussion on the issue of low-skilled immigration. From a purely economic perspective, most forms of immigration will lead to a net growth in wages, even for native citizens.

cv0jqss,1,t3_3ktqzh,rAlexanderAcosta,"Mass immigration, even if unskilled, is good when there is no welfare state. People come for jobs and work for a lower price and produce great products for us to enjoy.

When you have immigration that is unskilled and a large public pot to draw benefits from, shit gets bad. ",4,0,1442185506,1444729338
cv10qd5,0,t1_cv0jqss,DailyFrance69,"This is pretty weird reasoning. Who is going to buy the ""great products"" they make if A. wages are lower and B. there's too much labor due to immigration and thus more unemployment? Just wanting to ""produce more great products"" is the definition of supply-side economics, a theory that has been widely discredited. Yes, your products will become cheaper, but it's pretty hard to make an iphone so cheap that even people _without money_ can buy it. You _need_ demand, flooding the market with cheap labor is not the way to go about that. 

Hell, the only way that could work is _with a welfare state_ which would support the workers enough so they could buy the products that get produced, artificially propping up the economy (until, of course, it gets overwhelmed by increasing influx of immigrants).

Mass immigration, even if unskilled, can theoretically be good, in the case where there are strong worker protection laws and a minimum wage keeping up wages enough to maintain an equilibrium in supply and demand. Additionally, those measures would balance out the amount of immigration, because it would be harder for companies to employ illegal immigrants and the playing field with regards to foreign and domestic labor competing with each other would be leveled. Of course, you might run into the problem that people might still come simply to get welfare as it would be much harder for them to get a job (since they get the same wage as native workers). Then you can either try to limit the welfare state or limit immigration. ",1,0,1442228952,1444729338
cv0lxmo,0,t1_cv0jqss,thewalkingfred,"Well then change the system, it sounds broken. Don't blame the immigrants for coming to a society that will literally give them free money.",2,0,1442189595,1444729338
cv17ju5,0,t1_cv0lxmo,Shiloh86,">Well change the system, it sounds broken.

It is *very* broken, and that's why so many candidates are making immigration a large part of their platform.",1,0,1442244327,1444729342
cv0m89w,1,t3_3ktqzh,Precursor2552,"What do you mean by 'scientifically' ? Proper scientists certainly have neither the tools, education, nor experience to answer the question. 

Political Scientists and our lost brothers and sisters in Economics do. And there have been a number of papers published about the topic. However I wouldn't say any of those are 'scientifically accepted.' 

I'm not sure if it's the paper in the discussion linked by u/ge93 but there was one that was being shared a bit earlier this year that I believe was from Denmark. 

It's not my area so I'm just searching it, but I got the following.

cv0wox0,1,t3_3ktqzh,ISBUchild,"You need to ask a specific question to get a scientific answer. Does high immigration lower wages? That can be studied, although the answer right now seems to be ""maybe"". If it doesn't lower wages, does that make it good? That's hard to answer scientifically. There is no objective answer to whether or not racial diversity or a language divide is a good thing, or bad, or bad but worth the economic benefits.",1,0,1442211829,1444729342
cv17kv8,1,t3_3ktqzh,mrhymer,What you are asking for is a sociological study which is a soft science. There can be no hard science on the subject because the scale is too big for controlled experimentation. The sociological study is the history of mankind. Most mass immigration has been by armies or settlers followed by armies. They have typically been massively harmful to the indigenous populations.,1,0,1442244370,1444729342
cv0etr1,1,t3_3ktqzh,Axdek,"Well liberals support a higher minimum wage  and immigration. This literally goes against economics. A high minimum wage creates less demand for jobs, then lots of low skilled immigrants (high supply) doesn't work. Half of legal immigrants go on welfare when NONE should. We should take the best of the world not the peasants. ",-1,0,1442177471,1444729342
cv0fjjd,0,t1_cv0etr1,thewalkingfred,"Im having trouble following your logic. Why would higher minimum wages create less demand for jobs? Because people only want one job instead of 3?

As for the immigrants going directly on welfare, that sounds pretty terrible if true, but why are we angry at the immigrants for taking advantage of a system that Europeans themselves designed? If it's not working right then change the system.

Regardless of what anti-immigration people say, mass immigration has worked out well in the past for the countries that were willing to take advantage of it.",2,0,1442178561,1444729342
cv0htcq,0,t1_cv0fjjd,stewshi,"I think he means employers would have a smaller demand for employees. A  minimum wage hike would be artificial growth of wages it wouldn't be caused by the economy doing better/ their being an increased demand for goods and services. So if the economic climate is the same but the government increases the minimum wage employers will go without low skilled workers who cost more then they are worth. 

 In regards to illegal immigrants  taking advantage of welfare systems it puts a burden on those systems they weren't designed to take. They are meant to be used by citizens who pay into the system and maintain it not those who don't.",1,0,1442182238,1444729342
cv0ltg0,0,t1_cv0htcq,thewalkingfred,"This is where it always gets difficult for me because I've heard people argue both ways for issues like this and both sound convincing. I've heard an economist say that increasing the minimum wage will help the economy because more people will have more money and time to put back into the economy then I hear people arguing the opposite. There never seems to be a place to get the actual data on economy trends after these programs are implemented. It's all just gut feeling, common sense bullshit.",1,0,1442189373,1444729342
cv0uy44,0,t1_cv0ltg0,stewshi,"One thing I've looked at is everytime the minimum wage is raised teenage and youth unemployment takes a dramatic hike. ( 2nd source) Young people and teens are going to be seen as less skilled then older people and rightfully so. Since a minimum wage job will likely be their first one most employers will forego people who they would hire because they used to be able to pay them less but now their value has been artificially raised. The minimum wage is a barrier for low skilled workers and the higher it gets the harder it is for them to enter the workforce.
