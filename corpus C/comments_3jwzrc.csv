If Trump and Bush are both out, we would simply see one of the other dozen candidates rise. It's not like they are the only two candidates. Romney will not be entering the race, running for President isn't just something you wake up and decide to do, it takes months of planning at a minimum, and there is no indication that Romney has had any interest in running.

Trump has been at the top from almost the very beginning. The more attention that he gets, the more popular that he gets. If you try to apply the model from the last election to this one, you will be way off base.",-1,0,1441633521,1444732082

That's because you, like most voters, know little about economics and are vulnerable to basing your positions on emotional appeals instead of actual research. 

Oh and our unemployment is 5.1%, approaching full employment and lowest it's been in 7 years. 

>What use are cheaper goods if no one can afford them?

Less then 10% of the workforce is in the manufacturing sector and nowhere close to all of those jobs have been outsourced so I don't know why you're acting like ""no one"" will be able to afford stuff because a some of those job got shipped overseas. And once again those many of those people will be employed in different sectors.

>Our economy is in deep shit right now as a direct result. You're absolutely talking out of your ass.

Says who?
