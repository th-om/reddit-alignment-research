3kz2lr,Aren't Bernie Sanders' proposed solutions to economic issues in America flawed in basic economic ways?,150,arz1,"In reference to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VePpQBCbKBw) and his campaign as a whole:

I agree that Sanders' is doing the right thing by pointing out American economic problems that have crippled the middle class and the poor over the past several decades but if he's so keen on fixing the economy, shouldn't his proposed solutions avoid hurting it even more?

For example, wouldn't a large increase in minimum wage cause inflation across the board?


Wouldn't free college tuition create an extremely over saturated market in college graduates as well as directly cause a proportional increase in federal taxes to provide functional schools across the nation?


And hasn't the gender gap in wages been proven to be a statistical myth when position is controlled for?

Yes, wealth inequality is an issue and many forms of media have shoved it down our throats for years now but is Sanders' really saying anything new or is he just using an idealistic platform to abuse the naivety of left-wing thinkers that don't understand basic economic concepts?
