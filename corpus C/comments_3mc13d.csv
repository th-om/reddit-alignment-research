Is where we might disagree. I suppose it depends on how we each define distinction though, so we could both be right. If I define it as ""the recognizing or noting of differences"" but you define it as ""condition of being different"" (two different definitions from [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/distinction)) we're both right.

So if there is an appropriations lapse, the engineers, physicists, and the rest that actually work to maintain the Arsenal go home and do nothing. Ditto the guys working on maintaining and upgrading the facilities the engineers, scientists, etc. use. The same folks, by the way (part of the Dept of Energy, so don't get me started on ""national defense conservatives"" that want DOE scrapped) run the Navy's nuclear propulsion program, so there's lost refueling time, too.

Now apply that to the Navy as a whole. It's not as widespread, but repair and refit contractors go home because bases are shut.

It's insane that we are even having this damn conversation. This spending bill should simply go through. No matter how right or wrong the 2013 shutdown was, this one is unexcusable.

cvdxjga,1,t3_3mc13d,Weaselbane,"I'm thinking through the next nominee.

Let's say a more conservative representative is put forward. This will be supported by less than 100% of Republicans. The more conservative the person, the less support they will get. Opposing them will be the Democrats (~43% of the votes) and those Republicans not supporting the nominee.

The House Freedom Caucus consists of about 42 representatives, or about ~10%. They will likely align only with a a fellow far right candidate. This leaves ~47% of the vote up for grabs.

Republicans who oppose a more conservative nominee will receive tremendous pressure from conservative organizations and more importantly, the big donors, who can withhold money in the last month before an election. This is a very large pressure, those not supporting will be threatened by loss of positions on panels, loss of PAC support, and loss of direct campaign contributions.

None the less, any candidate who is a moderate will only need to gather about 30 (out of 247) Republican votes to become the nominee, as they would likely enjoy the support of the Democrats! I believe this is unlikely, but would certainly be interesting to see. This was actually one of things that kept Boehner in power, and which made the far right very upset.

So any potential nominee must run that line between being moderate enough to keep 13% of the Republicans from voting against them, and conservative enough to appease the rank and file.

Lastly, the Freedom Caucus has wielded a lot of power in large part because they were in a swing vote position, that is that without their votes the Republicans could not muster over 50% of the votes. In this case they are not in that position  and will be relying extensively on outside influences (large money donors, Fox news) to try to influence the outcome. Given the appeal of Trump currently, this has become somewhat disruptive.

It will be interesting.

None. The idea is compromises between the parties, that are pragmatic and workable. That's been the American way for a long time. 

Perhaps you can name a left-wing piece of legislation W passed?

Bush and his policies led to the world economic crisis. He spent trillions on a war in Iraq that we were told would be paid for by Iraqi oil revenues.... 

/u/ IUhoosier_KCCO addressed the budget issue in his link. 


I don't get today's republicans. They support the police but hate regulators, who are there to police corporations. They say they want small government but create huge new government agencies like the TSA rather than simply increase regulation, training and raise wages for private company airport screeners. They want to privatize schools and prisons but the government needs to control who can travel and who can't? 

I have a lot of very thoughtful reasonable discussions with libertarians these days, but with republicans it's either they repeat mindless words they heard somewhere and don't listen or it's  a counselling session for an exhausted man who keeps saying No, No that's not what our party is about!
