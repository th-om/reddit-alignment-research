cvjgeqg,1,t3_3mzhmu,yo2sense,"It's an oversimplification. There are disagreements around the edges of fiscal policy. Democrats argue for more regulation and Republicans for less. But yes, in general both parties represent the financial interests of the donor class so they are mostly on the same page. ",3,0,1443631890,1444721423
cvjgcei,1,t3_3mzhmu,spaceghoti,"With regard to foreign policy I largely agree: the Democrats have been falling over themselves to refute the decades-long claim that they're weak and cowardly. However, that's produced a foreign policy that's forced the Republicans to move even farther to the extreme right, to the degree that they consider even a *hint* of diplomacy to be tantamount to surrender. The latest example would be the deal with Iran.

So they're still not exactly the same in foreign policy, but Democrats are pretty close to the Republicans in being hawkish.",5,0,1443631799,1444721427
cvjh8q9,1,t3_3mzhmu,oldie101,"I disagree. 

Fiscal policy is something that Democrats & Republicans strongly disagree on. Be it corporate tax rates, minimum wage & taxes in general. 

A general disagrement in terms of ideology which affects policy is the idea of ones production and the affect it should have on quality of life. Democrats do not care for holding people's actions accountable as much as Republicans do. Democrats cite lack of opportunity, discrimination & other factors which prevent individuals from succeeding. Republicans cite laziness, social programs & other factors that enable individuals to be non-participating members in this society. 

Fundamentally it comes down to a disagreement about capitalism. Republicans strongly uphold capitalism even if the system is flawed. Democrats try to curtail capitalism with social programs in order to rectify the flaws that they see with capitalism.

cvjgciq,1,t3_3mzhmu,houinator,"There are decent differences on economic policy as well, probably the loudest example right now would be the debate over raising the minimum wage.  They also have fundamentally different approaches to organized labor, which remained consistent even as social positions shifted after the Southern Strategy.",1,0,1443631804,1444721430
cvjq5kp,1,t3_3mzhmu,tenthreeleader,"Not really.  Those social policies the Republicans have which are still different from Democrats are always surrendered in discussions such as the one over Planned Parenthood.  Republicans enable Democrat social policies so it can hardly be called ""opposition"".

The difference in foreign policies is in how the parties see America's role in the world.  American interventions in the Obama era are due to American weakness creating the need for intervention (see just about every action taken as a result of the ""Arab Spring"").

cvjjmnm,1,t3_3mzhmu,BoiseNTheHood,"It's true.  Throughout our history, fiscal irresponsibility at home and warmongering abroad have been the two major constants, regardless of whether the president is an R or a D or which party dominates Congress.  The last time we fully paid down the debt was 1835.  We have been at war in some form or fashion for 93% of our history - 222 out of our 239 years as a nation.  The last president from either party that wasn't a total big-government statist was Calvin Coolidge, who left office in 1929.

The two major parties have long been, to paraphrase Barry Goldwater, ""an echo, not a choice.""  They've been the Red and Blue wings of the Welfare-Warfare Party.",0,0,1443636457,1444721430
cvjgl79,1,t3_3mzhmu,TheGreatWolfy,"I totally agree. The major parties divide us based on social issues to distract us from their economic policies being essentially the same(thats not to say its not important).
