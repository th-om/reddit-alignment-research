The ACA is a good example, as is the system we had before it.  Something really needed to change, but it took us far too long to tackle the problem.  Then, we ended up with the ACA.  Which isn't bad (imo), but you have a sizable part of the population that wants to roll it back and implement other changes, and another sizable part of the population that doesn't think it went far enough.

But I doubt any substantial changes are made to the ACA for a decade or two, although that could depend on the 2016 elections.

Basically, the slow, incremental change would be totally fine if the incremental changes were always good policy.  Typically, though, they're pretty flawed.  The result of partisan fighting, rather than an actual increment towards some kind of greater design.  When you couple that with the fact that our incremental changes happen at a pace that's far slower than they should, like tackling healthcare reform decades later than we should've, and I think ""broken"" is probably a pretty good descriptor for our system.

**TL;DR:** Our system isn't really incremental, it's just slow.  We still tend to have sweeping changes, because we wait far too long to try to fix our problems.

A slow one of increasing dysfunction and partisans pouring their energies into blocking and blaming each other. More and more we get mired in self-imposed ""constitutional crises"" driven by the increasing investment of the populace in ideological warfare, distracting Washington from pressing practical issues.

Then we hit a recession we can't react to, the rest of the world bounces back faster than us and we lose influence, inflaming the infighting. Or we find strategic rivals taking advantage of the widely perceived inability to build any kind of consensus.

Neither side is particularly interested in this, though.  Democrats refute or downplay the idea of welfare abuse (which is grossly overstated in political rhetoric and public perception), but Republicans rarely attempt to implement changes that would actually try to address abuse and only abuse.

Republicans would rather have the welfare queen stereotype to throw around and vilify impoverished Americans.  It's why you see them use the stereotype while calling for cuts in welfare services, not when trying to implement systems to catch fraud and abuse.

Democrats, meanwhile, look like they're defending these abusers more than they actually intend to, because they're defending welfare programs from being gutted.   

Edit: Not to say that this is what's happening every single time, but it's a pretty common story.

cvidwz2,0,t1_cvi9gin,BrutePhysics,"A couple of things:

* Everyone who knows welfare recipients *thinks* they know an abuser.  Yes, there are definitely abusers out there but often what people describe as someone ""clearly"" abusing the system is just someone who happened to get lucky recently so they have a nice thing, or someone who over time has gained some nice things, that seems out-of-line for someone who is poor.  It is a perception that if you are on welfare then you don't deserve anything nice ever because you should be working to get out of welfare but that is just not reality.  For many, including my parents, you try and try and try and after the umpteenth time that life throws you back to the shitter, instead of thinking ""i need to save and work to get out of this""... you start thinking ""well i'm going to be here forever so I might as well spend that tax return on a few nice things to make this crap life a bit worth living"".  *That* is often why you will see families where kids have a nice phone/tv/etc... but still have food insecurity or a shitty apartment or etc...  Does it suck that such people have effectively given up and resigned themselves to live on welfare forever? Yes, but it is also the reality of living in a shitty situation for that long and almost no amount of ""bootstrapped-ness"" is going to fix that.  These situations it's hard to call ""abuse"", imo.

* Next is that generally speaking we all *do* know who ""that one person"" is in our communities that abuses shit.  The guy who is working under the table and refuses to record it, the guy who falsifies taxes to get a higher return assuming the IRS won't pay attention to such low income anyway, etc.. etc.. This is real fraud and abuse but it really is rare but generally speaking nobody who knows is gonna report the guy because they are to busy dealing with their own shit to go through that whole procedure.  Based on the U.S. Department of Labor statistics ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_fraud)) this accounts for merely 2.67% of welfare recipients which brings me to my next point...

* It costs a lot of money to go after a small percentage of abusers.  You have to actually *expand* the welfare system every time you put in new restrictions or monitoring or fraud prevention because you gotta hire people to actually *find* this abuse.  When fraud is rampant this is a great idea because the money you save often pays for the program itself easily, but the smaller the percentage of fraud, the harder it is to find and the less you get out of finding it.  While not an example of fraud, lets take the ""drug testing welfare recipients"" movement as a prime example.  Many states have tried this based on the commonly held belief that drug usage is rampant in the welfare recipient pool, but without fail every single one was a complete waste of money.  Arizona, for example, tested tens of thousands of people and found *one* person on drugs, saving them a net total of a couple thousand bucks for the program costing hundreds of thousands of extra dollars.  Excessive (keyword: excessive) fraud and abuse searches would result similarly.  

* On top of that, in order to truly defeat abusers you would have to make the system highly invasive into the lives of welfare recipients.  Constant monitoring of welfare recipients requires them to constantly prove themselves at welfare offices or to welfare officials, taking time out of their day that they could be productively working (albeit at rather low paying jobs).  Not to mention the moral stigma involved here.  Furthermore, fraud is one thing, but often people talk about abuse in really morally questionable ways because ""well *we* are paying for them so *we* should get to decide what they spend it on"".  This is probably my least persuasive point when talking to conservative-minded folk but really, do we want to get into the habit of regulating the consumption of poor people simply because they need welfare?  

There is a lot more to this, and truth be told I don't really expect to change your mind.  Most people don't really ever change their minds on this stuff but hopefully this at least colors your perspective a bit to see where i'm coming from.  Either way, i should probably stop procrastinating and get back to work :P",4,0,1443552800,1444722541
cvil6bd,0,t1_cvidwz2,lametown_poopypants,"I appreciate the thoughtful response and you're right it didn't change my mind.   

Point 1 - you would be clear to note that I made sure to caveat that having nice things isn't of itself any indicator.  They could have come from anywhere.  Maybe relatives saved for a long time or something.  However, I think it's pretty sad that we accept that some people just don't wish to try to even better themselves to be minimally self-sufficient so we should coddle them.  I get that life's hard and failure sucks.  I have been fortunate enough to not be there personally, but I don't see why this is something we have to let persist.  We have a safety net.  We do not have a wheelbarrow to carry those who do not to wish to carry themselves.  If you fall, we should be there to help you to your feet.  If you lay down in the middle of traffic, well, that's your call.  

So nearly 3 million people steal from those who need it (using your 2.67% and based on [109,631,000 on welfare](http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/terence-p-jeffrey/354-percent-109631000-welfare)), but it's just not worth it?  If each of those people took just $100/month, that's $3.5 billion we're just throwing away and we don't care.  I know it's small in context of the larger government bloat, but we as a country refuse to engage in honest debate about the big issues.  Heaven forbid you suggest touching Social Security or Medicare.  Further looking puts average welfare received at about [$9,000 per year](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/05/04/the-average-us-welfare-payment-puts-you-in-the-top-20-of-all-income-earners/) which puts welfare fraud at $26 billion a year.  [Which is almost twice what we spend on agriculture, and nearly what we spend on transportation.](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/)  Again, these numbers are based on averages and are likely way off, but I was bored. 

I hate that this is the token response for anything involving abuse; it's just too hard to monitor.  Especially since the left is the group that pushes the welfare state.  If you can't responsibly administer it, why should the citizens be coerced to fund it and continue to fund more of it?  Why is it the goal of the left to continue to expand this monstrosity?  Shouldn't we be able to hold the government responsible for the use of our tax dollars?  Gosh, we can get all pissed off that the secret service buys some hookers, but get defrauded of $20 billion and no one gives a fuck.  It just blows my mind sometimes.  

I don't get how welfare recipients are beyond reproach.  We can't hurt their feelings.  I mean, their lives are so hard they've given up on being productive members of society so they blow any savings on shiny shit because they can.  Gosh, they're so darn precious.  You kind of said it, I just put a little polish on it.   I've said nothing about what they spend it on.  Nice strawman.

cvidlpj,0,t1_cvid4ap,NothingCrazy,"Fox news is also famous for using footage from one event and claiming it's from another to support a lie. This is just what they were caught doing in a single year by one source: 

>Fox News presents year-old Palin footage as new Palin book tour crowd. As Think Progress first noted, on the November 18 edition of Happening Now, guest co-host Gregg Jarrett used old footage -- which he said was ""just coming in to us"" -- of a McCain-Palin rally from last year to illustrate how Sarah Palin is ""continuing to draw huge crowds"" during her book tour. The following day, Skinner apologized for ""mistakenly"" airing the fake crowd video.

>Stewart blasts Hannity for using old video footage to inflate Bachmann rally attendance. During the November 10 edition of Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Stewart blasted Fox News host Sean Hannity for attempting to inflate the crowd size of Rep. Michele Bachmann's (R-MN) Fox News-fueled GOP rally against health care reform by using footage of the crowd at the better-attended 9-12 rally. On the November 11 edition of his program, Hannity said he ""screwed up"" and apologized for airing ""incorrect video"" of 9-12 protests while discussing the Bachmann rally.

>Fox News' Garrett apologizes for fake HBO-Obama story -- which Fox News repeated days later. During the November 4 edition of America's Newsroom, guest co-host Martha MacCallum started the fake story that President Obama watched an HBO special about himself instead of the November 3 election returns. The fake story was then picked up by Rush Limbaugh, among others, who claimed that ""[i]f a documentary could get anal poisoning, this one could."" On the November 4 edition of Studio B with Shepard Smith, White House correspondent Major Garrett apologized for mishearing press secretary Robert Gibbs and passing on the erroneous information. Despite the Fox News correction, on the November 8 edition of Fox News Watch, Fox News' weekly media analysis program, host Jon Scott repeated the fake story, claiming that Obama was ""watching the HBO documentary. ... Now, maybe that's the one thing that could pull him away from -- from election returns.""

>Kilmeade: Americans don't have ""pure genes"" like Swedes because ""we keep marrying other species and other ethnics."" As Gawker noted, on the July 8 edition of Fox & Friends, co-host Brian Kilmeade said that Americans don't have ""pure genes"" like Swedes because ""we keep marrying other species and other ethnics."" Kilmeade apologized for his ""inappropriate"" remarks on July 20.

>Democrat Mark Sanford. During the June 24 edition of Fox News' Live Desk, while covering a press conference of embattled South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, Fox News ran on-screen text identifying him as a Democrat:On Live Desk the next day, co-host Trace Gallagher made ""a correction for something we put up on the screen during our coverage during the governor's press conference yesterday. We briefly identified Governor Sanford as a Democrat. He is, of course, a Republican. And we apologize for getting that wrong.""

>Fox News presents deceptively cropped 6-month-old Biden clip as new. On the March 16 edition of Live Desk, MacCallum claimed that ""after weeks of economic doom and gloom, the Obama administration is now singing a slightly different tune. Take a look at what was said in recent interviews this weekend."" Live Desk then aired clips of administration officials purportedly giving an optimistic view of the economy, which included video of Vice President Joe Biden stating, ""The fundamentals of the economy are strong."" However, Biden did not make those remarks during an ""interview"" that weekend; he made them at a September 2008 campaign event in which he criticized statements by Sen. John McCain. MacCallum apologized the next day, stating: ""When we get something wrong, we admit it. We did so yesterday, and for that we apologize.""

>Fox News Watch's Scott claims ""[w]e don't have any idea"" what Biden said to AFL-CIO, but transcript was available. On March 9, Scott claimed on Fox News Watch that Biden's appearance at an AFL-CIO executive council meeting was ""closed to the press,"" adding, ""We don't have any idea what he said there."" In fact, the White House released a transcript of Biden's AFL-CIO speech, and ""a pool of print reporters"" reportedly covered the speech at the request of the White House.

>Fox passes off GOP press release as its own research -- typo and all. During the February 10 edition of Happening Now, Scott purported to ""take a look back"" at how the economic recovery plan ""grew, and grew, and grew."" In doing so, Scott referenced seven dates, as on-screen graphics cited various news sources from those time periods -- all of which came directly from a Senate Republican Communications Center press release. A Fox News on-screen graphic even reproduced a typo contained in the Republican press release.

>The following day, Scott apologized -- for running the typo. Scott's apology was criticized by Washington Post media critic and CNN host Howard Kurtz, who said: ""We sometimes jab at the pundits for using talking points, but in the case of Fox News anchor Jon Scott, it was literally true this week. ... You should be apologizing for using partisan propaganda from the GOP without telling your viewers where it came from. Talk about missing the point.""

In high school and my freshman year of college I was an extremely cringy, outspoken atheist left winger. The area I grew up in was relatively conservative/moderate. When I went to college, and was surrounded by classmates and professors who I agreed with,  I realized how I came off to people.

 I found that the left was not good at explaining or defending their positions, so much as silencing any opposition. All of the things that you see on /r/tumblrinaction *are* actually occurring on campuses throughout America. Trigger warnings, white privilege, socialist professors that propagandize to a captive audience due to mandated liberal arts courses; these things are really quite frightening. The left wing professors seemed to come off as mean spirited and angry.

I had one conservative Christian professor and he was the most amazing dude. Let anyone  who disagreed with him speak up and debate with a kindly smile on his face. Would grade papers  fairly even if they disagreed with his own worldview.

 2 My Middle Eastern fiance.

My fiance is an apostate from Islam who grew up in a conservative Middle Eastern country, who I met while studying abroad. A liberal feminist in her own country, it is amazing to see her reaction to the sort of white liberal identity politics that we have in the West. 

It would be the *death penalty* for her to date me in her country, let alone be an apostate from Islam. Yet she sees white liberals in the west kowtow to Islam, and defend hijab wearing ""Muslim Feminists"". She thinks that the current Muslim immigration to Europe will be a disaster and she has even confronted do-gooder liberals on this.

Since when are teenagers (as a group - I know there are individual ones who manage to be) reasonable and considered in their opinions about anything? 

For example, speaking as a liberal feminist tree hugger myself (who is also married to a Muslim man, though Central Asian in my case), I think it's fairly obvious that the current Muslim immigration to Europe is going to be a disaster, not necessarily because they're Muslim, but because they're poor, undereducated, and dispossessed. (Being Muslim is a complication, since poor, undereducated, and dispossessed Muslims are a lot more likely to become terrorists or murder their female relatives for ""honor"" than, say, Mexicans of similar education level and lack of prospects, but is not the major issue in and of itself, as your fiancee and my husband demonstrate.) 

I guess I kind of hope that it will be a lesson to Europeans (and hopefully Americans, though we're more insulated from the after-effects of our own stupid policies, unfortunately) to stop fucking around in the Middle East's internal politics. It's Europe and the US that installed and is currently propping up the al Saud dynasty, which is largely responsible for the spread of Wahhabism and fundamentalist Islam over the last few decades.

Yeah, that doesn't follow in the least for two reasons.

But if a disproportionate number are compared to the native population, then their presence is necessarily detrimental. Moreover, well short of being violent, there's still quite a good chance that most won't meaningfully assimilate, and that they will burden the social welfare systems of their reluctant host countries.

All of my siblings are conservatives with strong feelings on economics and social issues.  We all went to Catholic Schools k-12 and very liberal public universities.  

I don't remember having a political leaning in high school, I didn't even know the difference between liberal and conservative.  As I got into college I remember being forced to take 3 GLBT courses as a requirement to graduate and I thought that it was strange to be forced to take classes of a certain ideology.  As I got into my studies I started to notice that there was not an open debate about social issues, anything that remotely resembled a conservative thought was either dismissed or belittled by professors and outspoken students.  When you are 18-22 years old you can tell when there is a half truth being told and I think that this forced me to examine/develop my own beliefs. ",9,0,1443540598,1444722581

That probably pushed me away from the left more than anything and after some experience in the work force, some independang studying of economics and simply observing Liberals and Conservatives themselves my views have been continually pushed further right.

In the alternative, perhaps you can stop feeling obliged to defend all single mothers everywhere, even from the people actually raised by them, simply because you happen to feel yours did a good job. He, moreso than you or I, is especially well positioned to judge the job his mother did. That it was a poor one ought not be a surprise, precisely because **most of the time** being a single mother reflects some seriously poor judgement skills in a woman's life. Save for cases where the father unexpectedly died due to circumstances beyond his control, being a single mother means choosing to carry to term a pregnancy in the absence of a truly stable relationship. In effect then, they set themselves up for the struggle that follows. That would reasonably seem to be a poor decision, and as such, raises questions about their judgement more generally. And those questions are broadly answered through the multitude of statistics that exist regarding single parent homes and the offspring raised therein. The picture is overwhelmingly grim. To the extent that your mother defied the odds and did a good job, that's great. But don't let your personal experience cloud the much bleaker reality. ",2,0,1443571651,1444722589

First, I think that is a dubious claim, in that having primary custody doesn't make you a single parent in the way that term is used. Second, even granting your point on its face, I fail to see how it negates what I've said. Divorce itself necessarily indicates a poor choice in who/when you married, and further to have kids within the confines of a poorly chosen marriage.

> Teen pregnancy is a different form and I'm all for a woman choosing whether or not to go through with it or not to prevent hardships. 

Again, this is a function of choice on every level, from having sex, to not using protection, to not getting an abortion, to not putting the realized offspring up for adoption. Indeed, as far single mothers who are of the greatest concern go, it is this group specifically. I'm not really worried about the 37 year old Facebook executive whose clock is ticking and decides to make use of a sperm bank.

1) If you go back to Marx, he was anti-family, as he saw it as a form of slavery to the capitalist system: you go to work, raise kids, teach them to be hard workers, they go to work, they raise kids, etc etc.

This is where the idea of ""it takes a villiage to raise a child comes from"". The family unit isn't too important, because the kid is property of the community. 

This brief commercial by some [MSNBC host puts it best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjczwQOnMqg).
