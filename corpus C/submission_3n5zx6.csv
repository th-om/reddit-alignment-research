3n5zx6,Idea for the gun problem in America. Curious about your thoughts...,44,itsmikeo,"Guns in the US are a staple. Sadly, in my opinion.
What if we built a gun exchange program that you could trade your gun in for a new gun of similar type that would be programmed to your hand/palm, and only trigger when the right hand was holding it?
If you sell your gun, you do so at a DMV type place for gun ownership transfers, where your hand is removed and the new owners hand is reprogrammed, once the proper paperwork is filled out and background checks been made.
OR...existing guns can be outfitted with the technology to put the accountability in the hands of the proper owner, and only the proper owner.
