cutwfaf,1,t3_3jyyi3,looklistencreate,The FTT is more regressive than it sounds. Lots of people have their savings in stocks and you don't want to discourage savings or investment. The effect on volatility has been shown to be pretty minimal too. It's basically just another sales tax that's being marketed to make it sound like it will only hit extremely rich people.,2,0,1441670367,1444731876
cutzpyo,0,t1_cutwfaf,TheGreatWolfy,"Well actually the EU commision found only a small negative effect on GDP, to the point where public investments made using the money would actually have a larger positive effect on the GDP than the tax would have a negative effect. Its really so small it'll really only amount to much on huge transactions or in high frequency trading, both only available to the rich. The tax is less than a percent and actually has a built in rebate.",0,0,1441676708,1444731876
cuu0x77,0,t1_cutzpyo,looklistencreate,I didn't mention effect on GDP. That wasn't the issue.,2,0,1441679010,1444731876
cuu24ix,0,t1_cuu0x77,TheGreatWolfy,"Oh sorry, Ive been busy so I really only scanned your post. To adress youe concerns, first most forms of savings would go untouched. Second there is a built in rebate for the poor anyways. Third the tax is so small it will really only have a noticable effect in large activites, so even if it applied to say retirement funds, it would take off pennies.",0,0,1441681324,1444731876
cuu3czz,0,t1_cuu24ix,looklistencreate,It doesn't sound like this would raise very much revenue. It pulls in only $38 billion a year between all 40 countries it exists in. ,2,0,1441683885,1444731876

cuuh052,0,t1_cuufg2s,looklistencreate,"The FTT implemented until the 60s didn't take in nearly that much. Besides, you're moving your target. These numbers are a lot lower if you exempt all the middle-class savings you said you would. It's either very progressive or takes in a lot of revenue, but not both. ",1,0,1441725241,1444731876
cuuj3ms,0,t1_cuuh052,TheGreatWolfy,The economy has also grown and inflation has occured since the 60's. The tax would apply only selectively to parts of the middle class. Most people would go almost entirely uneffected.,1,0,1441728663,1444731876
cuuk58j,0,t1_cuuj3ms,looklistencreate,"Yes, and the scope of the government has expanded accordingly so that proportional revenue would be raised. The FTT was never a major part of the pie and unless we expand it to more middle-class savings I don't see it raising that much money.",1,0,1441730324,1444731876
cuutfqc,0,t1_cuuk58j,TheGreatWolfy,"The share of the pie enjoyed by the rich who this mainly effects has grown, while our economy also transitions to an economy with more to do with finance as our economy grows despite a shrinking manufacturing sector.

cuufl9n,1,t3_3jyyi3,,"Its a losing policy politically. 

Most people dont care about sweeping macroeconomic arguments, they care about what will happen to them. Anyone with any money invested in the stock market (around 55% of americans) are going to see that and very easily imagine how their investment will down the drain. You literally lose 1% of your money every time you buy and sell a stock. Thats ridiculous.",1,0,1441722633,1444731876
