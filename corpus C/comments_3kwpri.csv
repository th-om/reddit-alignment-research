cv149dv,1,t3_3kwpri,heycoworker,"The only people you are hearing this from are on the left. the GOP has been steadily growing in influence in national politics since the 1980s. On a state level, the Democratic Party is the weakest its been since reconstruction.  between 1930 and 1980, the GOP controlled congress for something like four years total, in the 21st century control of congress switches regularly. GOP membership levels have remained essentially unchanged since reagan while the Democratic Party has shrunk significantly during that same period. The Democrats still maintain a demographic edge over the GOP but the idea that the GOP is going anywheres soon is pretty misguided. ",8,0,1442238493,1444729024
cv157hr,0,t1_cv149dv,auralgasm,"On a state level, the Democrats are hampered by the fact that states like Wyoming are given representation that vastly outstrips the actual population size, as well as redistricting making state maps extremely favorable to Republicans. The Democrats have a difficult time with the makeup of Congress because of this, and will for a looong time in the future.

On the PRESIDENTIAL level, the electoral map is actually really favorable to Democrats and only getting more so as time goes on. States that were previously Republican strongholds, like Virginia, are growing more purple and even blue. Colorado and New Mexico were once considered swing states, but forget about it now. No Republican is going to win either in 2016, although you bet they are going to try hard for CO. It will be in vain. There's a whole mess of ""swing"" states that pretty soon are no longer going to be considered swing.",-3,0,1442240338,1444729024
cv15ok7,0,t1_cv157hr,heycoworker,"The democrats still have a clear demographic edge in terms of presidential politics but their disadvantage in state legislatures and congress is a pretty huge issue. State politics is basically the farm league for national politics, and the democrats dont have a ton of good national prospects atm. I mean the two most discussed names for the democratic nomination are clinton and Biden, both old white former 1990's superstars on the last legs of their political careers. It only take one weak presidential candidate to mess it up for the party. Carter's weak policy leadership paved the way for Reagan's landslide victory and the rise of strong modern conservatism and the budgetary brinkmanship of the bush 43 years was a huge check to the momentum of the conservative movement. If the democrats want to maintain their presidential edge they're going to need to dig up some dynamic young political prospects to answer the Rubio's and Ryan's on the right.",3,0,1442241200,1444729024
cv1821k,0,t1_cv15ok7,SapCPark,"The thing about dynamic prospects is that is what they are, prospects.  Look at Bobby Jindel and Christie.  Three years ago their political star was shooting upwards.  Now, they might as well not exist in the national conversation.  Rand Paul is heading in a similar direction with his campaign.  There is a small window where a rising star in politics has to make it big, and the GOP rising stars are missing the window or fucking up their chances.  

Also are said stars you mentioned really stars if Trump and Ben Carson are dominating the polls right now?  We hype up Rubio, Paul, Walker and Cruz and then they get to the national stage and are right now flopping outside of Cruz who is beating expectations at the moment.  Ryan was beaten by Biden in the debates and came off as naive at times.  Barack Obama is a rarity in that he was able to live up to the potential and become President.  Maybe the GOP stars can but right now, round 1 for them is going poorly and for Rubio, this gamble could be a disaster as he would be out of office if he doesn't get the nomination (He can't run for President and Senator at the same time in Florida law).

cv1a58i,0,t1_cv1821k,heycoworker,"the point is more that the republicans have a younger generation of nationally recognizable politicians well positioned to take over the leadership of the party and the democrats simply do not. I really doubt his campaign is going to ruin anything for Rubio, at the end of the day he's a popular young senator from a swing state. As for Ryan, he's being lined up to succeed the current republican congressional leadership. The Democrats don't have nearly as many prominent figures of that same generation. Thats going to be a huge issue in the future. Eventually they are going to have to replenish their national leadership and there aren't going to be a whole lot of experienced campaign-tested options as compared to the republicans.

even if rubio and ryan don't pan out as national leaders, the republicans have plenty of options while the Democrats increasingly look like a party run by old white people, they're in desperate need of fresh blood, and the 2016 slate has made that painfully clear. ",1,0,1442248456,1444729024
cv1m2m7,0,t1_cv1a58i,kcash935,">the 2016 slate has made that painfully clear

Could you argue that the ""prospect"" Democrats just aren't wasting their time or money considering it's been a pretty widely held belief that either Clinton or Biden would more than likely be the nominee, and, given their résumé, they wouldn't be able to compete? Hillary and Joe have a pretty impressive, and long, sheet, why waste the energy when you could focus on building your own résumé through other avenues rather than be a blip and fade out early?

Also, having a plethora of candidates running does not make it a strong point for the GOP. Most of the candidates are behind on a lot of issues with America as a whole. The Republican debate was a clown show. I tuned in because i was genuinely interested in hearing the policies but I left unimpressed and, honestly, was laughing. I really, really want to take some of the Republican candidates seriously, but it's hard when you listen to them. ",1,0,1442266741,1444729024
