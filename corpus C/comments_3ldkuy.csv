I mean, right now I know where about 300 illegal immigrants live.

But they do lower prices due to lower labor costs, BUT they do not put in more tax dollars than they take; it is impossible for LOW skilled and LOW payed immigrants and citizens to do this.

Also with labor shortages low skilled immigrants do not compliment existing labor, even Bernie sanders is against it. They price citizens out of the market.

Our system is broken because people don't follow our laws.  People advocate for people to NOT follow our laws.  That's what breaks the system.

That's all not a requirement.  All you need to do is state that you're going to deport the ones you catch.  If they lose some possessions because they're here illegally, that is a consequence of them breaking the law.  Figuring out what to do with natural born children can be handled in its own way.

It does not come from xenophobia because we still readily allow thousands of people from those same regions to immigrate legally.  It is punishing people that violated the law and insist on *breaking* our immigration system, which is one of the most generous immigration systems in the world.

Some of them are rapists and thieves.  Murderers too.  Some are also pedophiles.  Some are gang members.  A lot of that type of activity is associated with illegal immigration.  Coyotes smuggling women across the borders into the US are known to rape women illegal immigrants with such frequency that it is common practice to get birth control prior to attempting the journey into the US.   So yes, I can handle the characterization.  Saying that some are those things doesn't mean you have to attempt to read it as ""All"" are those things.

>Does that seem like a reasoned analysis of what an average Mexican immigrant is like? If so, you might be a racist.

Or it could mean I'm familiar with some of the problems associated with illegal immigration.  Illegal immigrant is not a race.

>Leaving aside the fact we already deport illegal immigrants when we find them

We do not, that's the problem.  We have illegal immigrants actively protesting our nation's immigration stance and our domestic benefits publically in the streets.  We have an illegal immigrant serving in public office in California and numerous cities that advocate not deporting illegal immigrants.

>except you know when Reagan and Obama gave out amnesty because let's face it

Reagan gave amnesty and our current problems show that was a huge mistake.  Obama has not given amnesty yet, but he is refusing to deport entire classes of illegal immigrants.

>integrating people into a system is cheaper and more beneficial than deporting all of them.

I don't believe that in the least.  1.  You support a lawless society, so you're basically advocating in favor of corruption.  2.  Many of the illegal immigrants are a net drain on our social safety net.  We have to pay for their children to attend our schools and we already have overburdened classroom sizes.  If they become citizens they'll have *more* access to entitlements and discussion has even been punted out to retroactively give them money from services.

>Trump is pretty much advocating for Jack booted thugs to go into immigrant communities, deport them and their American citizen children.

How so?  This is a common theme from pro-illegal immigration advocates.  They act like armies will be raised to enforce the law.  It's not necessary, you just have to allow local law enforcement to actually help enforce the law if they want to and be serious about actually enforcing the law.  

Birthright citizenship can be questioned and the determination isn't necessarily that it would ever be retroactively revoked.  We're the only country that has this silly policy and its obviously being taken advantage of by more than one class of immigrants.

>That's racist as he'll.

Conservatives opposed the Civil Rights Act because they could see the fundamental problems with it, which we are currently dealing with.  Issues like Title IX that enforces gender equality, saw the reduction of male collegiate sports to make them even with female collegiate sports.  Gender favoritism in higher education, that continues to this day despite females earning the majority of college degrees.  

That doesn't make you a racist.

As far as black voting rights, Republicans gave them the voting rights after they fought the Civil War to free blacks from slavery.  Republicans also fought against Southern Democrats that enforced Jim Crow laws.

>Or when the front runner of republican primaries called immigrants (who have no greater propensity for crime than natives) rapists.

Already addressed the rapists point, have you forgotten it already?  As for the no greater propensity for crime than natives...that's true...when you compare illegal immigrants to native prison populations, which is actually what the study compared.

Why does that not help?  Seems to me that you're trotting out a racist argument again.

Don't recall the terrorist comparison, but it's entirely legitimate to criticize ""protesters"" that behave like ""rioters"".

Andrew Jackson was a Democrat and he's the reason the Democratic party symbol is a Donkey....because opponents called him a Jackass.

Are you claiming there **IS** a demographic war that we should be fighting?

Regardless of whether you believe that or not, your opinion is inherently racist because you believe people's political views are inherently based on the color of their skin.  Brown people *have* to think this.  Black people *have* to think that.

Oh, I'm familiar with the claim put out by Democrats.  It's completely self-serving to them to absolve them of their own racial history and place it on their political opposition.  The entire argument rests on a single Presidential campaign by Nixon where he captured some of the Southern Vote.  Nixon's first election, the south went to George Wallace, who ran as an independent, but was a lifelong Democrat (He's the guy that was standing in a school door to prevent school segregation when the schools were integrated by Republican Eisenhower).  The next election, Nixon won the entire country (Or just about).  The election after that...The Democrats won the South again under Carter.  Then the South went to Reagan because he also won the entire country electorally.

>During the 19th and 20th centuries the two parties have made numerous changes in their professed policies and ideologies

What changed in the 19th century?  The Democrats had continuous control of Southern politics from Slavery times through until the late 60s and 70s.  Also the time when racial turmoil was rampant in the South.  

The Republicans started capturing local level elections in the 80s and that time also coincides with a far less amount of racial tension and increased voting from Blacks.  Yet, still, the Republicans are called racist.
