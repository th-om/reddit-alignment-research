3lrfo4,Can someone explain Hillary Clinton's popularity to me? I honestly do not understand it.,36,SlowMotionSprint,"Now, I personally don't care about the email nonsense and while I feel for the families of those lost in Benghazi, I understand that that is one of those situations where the bad guys just won.  

But I do not understand the support for Hillary Clinton. Her career as a politician is, well, kind of non-existent. Now, I know that she served in both the senate and as SoS, but she didn't really...do anything in either of those positions.  

She authored nor passed any significant legislation as a US Senator. For the most part, she spent most of her time as a senator just being a senator. She was essentially an empty seat.  

Her career as Secretary of State was much the same. She was SoS, but didn't really do much of anything, and one could argue our international diplomacy has improved quite a bit since she left the position.  

So this is why I do not get the support she has garnered. She was married to a popular president, but that is not really something that qualifies someone for a position.  

And on top of it, she changes her positions quite often, to fit whatever the prevailing position is at the moment. She is also fiscally, more or less, a neoconservative republican. And she still hasn't really shared any part of her 2016 platform yet.  

So we essentially have a politician with no real accomplishment in any post she has ever had, is pretty far to the right on policy, has shared nothing about her would be presidential platform, and who has shown no history of sticking to convictions...and it just makes no sense that she has the level of popularity she has on the left.  

If the Republicans were running a candidate like Hillary Clinton the left would have a field day and tear it apart.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lrfo4/can_someone_explain_hillary_clintons_popularity/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442807213,1444726196
