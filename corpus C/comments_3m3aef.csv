cvblixz,1,t3_3m3aef,Elder_Yautja,"The scenario you have presented is almost impossible by definition. The only way a minimum wage could have no dis-employment effect is if it was so low that *no one*, not one person, earns below that level, which makes it kind of irrelevant.

A minimum wage sufficiently high that a lot of people are on that line will, necessarily, be disbarring from employment people do not possess the skills/experience to secure a job at that wage or higher.

You are asking what would happen to economics in an example scenario, when that example appears to be operating in some kind of alternate twilight zone reality where economics does not apply.

Its similar to someone asking what would happen if you could travel faster than the speed of light? You cannot travel faster than the speed of light the laws of physics prohibit it. ""But what if you could?"" is the inevitable follow up question. In that case the question is what do the laws of physics predict would happen, in a universe where the laws of physics do not apply.

Its self contradictory, as is your example. You are asking what economics predicts would happen, in an example that could never exist given the laws of basic economics.",1,0,1443031171,1444724944

Currently, there is more labor than there is a demand for it, thus we have lower wages and higher unemployment. We have these things because we just came out of / still coming out of a really bad recession, One that has been the worst since the great depression.

Once the economy finally gets back to pre 2008 levels of stability (you will know because the fed will raise their intrest rate from 0%), the market will shift back in favor of the employee, causing wages to rise and unemployment to fall.

Actually yes it has. There's been a drive to the bottom - the Great Recession accelerated it, but things were moving this way for decades. 

One of the major factors is the drop in unions, something that won't be coming back even when the market shifts back to ""favor"" the employee. This coincides with the loss of manufacturing and other middle-income jobs that simply aren't returning in a global economy.

Yes things will steadily improve, but what we have to look forward to are thousands of Chipotle jobs that can't be outsourced simply because someone has to actually hand you something. Sure they're better than an onslaught of McDonalds employment opportunities, but only in the sense that losing two fingers is ""better"" than losing four.",1,0,1443031402,1444724948
cvblymd,0,t1_cvblot4,Sollexs,"I don't agree at all. We will still need plenty of office bots for the foreseeable future, and more office bots tend to be needed as businesses grow.

I see the chipotle jobs being replaced with robots and our manufacturing coming back in the way of robotic plants as it would be cheaper to use robots and be able to ship locally than to have laborers or even robots across the world then ship it across the world.

That will open up more jobs, granted not nearly as many as we lost when manufacturing went overseas, just a handful of people at each plant to make sure everything stays running, maybe a few sets so they can rotate shifts.

There really is no drive to the bottom, that is a dem talking point and a fallacy. There have been over saturations of certain markets causing wages to be lowered, and mixing oversaturation (The fact that every kid now a days is pushed to college has basically made degrees worthless, and to get the same benifit as a college degree 30 years ago, you need to get something higher than a bachelors) with a poor economy just pushes wages down and unemployment up.",2,0,1443031793,1444724948
