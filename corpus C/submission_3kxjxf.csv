3kxjxf,Are there strong arguments in favor of more conservative opinions that liberals don't expose themselves to?,207,werewolf1224,"I grew up in a pretty liberal city, so many of the political opinions and arguments that I am used to are very liberal. Consequently, many liberal arguments just ""make sense"" to me. I recently became aware of how many prestigious conservative think tanks there are, and, I am wondering if there are strong arguments that support conservative points of view that are either ignored or overlooked by liberals. It seems like there should be arguments and research out there that would not support my own opinions because I'm sure that the people who work for these think tanks are more educated than I am when it comes to public policy.
