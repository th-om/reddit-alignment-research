cvexs4b,1,t3_3mh2u3,jupiterkansas,"International tensions are nothing close to what they were during the cold war, esp. during the Bay of Pigs, when Russia was putting nuclear missiles in Cuba to launch attacks against the U.S., and the U.S. was putting missiles in Turkey aimed at the USSR and plotting to assassinate Fidel Castro.

I grew up with the constant terror of nuclear war. The fear was very real and unending throughout my childhood. The possibility is still there, but the nuclear nations are not aggressive enemies the way they once were. There is instability around the world, but none of it is threatening to collapse into world war. The biggest threat to the world today is a vague ""global warming"" with unknown consequences, but from 1950 to the 1990s it was all out nuclear war. The biggest nuclear threat today is some terrorist group getting hold of a bomb and using it to destroy a single city, which would be horrible, but nothing like the earth-ending threats I grew up with.

The USSR was a superpower on par with the US, with opposing ideologies and a long-standing animosity left over from World War II. It seemed like war between them was inevitable, and things like the space race only escalated those tensions. All it took was one false move. Since the collapse of the USSR, Russia is still powerful but nothing like the threat it once was, and has no plans for world dominion. 

The US today is an unequaled power, but it's worldwide military presence is generally aimed at maintaining stability (as long as it's beneficial for us) rather than domination. We have installed our own puppet leadership in countries around the world but we haven't actually taken over a country since we gave up our interest in the Philippines in 1946. We even had Japan at the end of the war but didn't keep it. It's just now how we roll. 

China is a growing superpower but it's not aggressive or expansionist, and it's likely that we're so economically tied to each other that war is not feasible. 

I would recommend that you stop listening to the prophets, turn off the TV news (which is mostly fear mongering - you'd think they'd like nothing better than for more war to break out), and start reading history books to get a better understanding of what's going on.

cvf388u,1,t3_3mh2u3,gmoney8869,"Chill the fuck out. 

The current international situation is about a hundred times more peaceful than it was during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

And by the way, FYI, there was hardly any chance of war even during the missile crisis. It crisis was just superpowers testing the limits of missile deployment, chance of fighting was 1% at best. 

And so now we are at .01%. The world is more peaceful than it has ever been in all of history and there is no chance at all that there will be a major war. Fucking relax kid. ",3,0,1443297429,1444723409

cvexje5,1,t3_3mh2u3,Vittgenstein,"If a nuclear war breaks out, it'll be from an accident since weapons systems have such narrow response Windows and frequently fail OR an attack with stolen weapons that is framed by a terror group to look like a proxy dirty bomb.

How might a nuclear weapons accident occur?

Does a launch require multiple-step validations?  

",2,0,1443290111,1444723409
cvezodu,0,t1_cvezaek,Vittgenstein,"Yeah but when an imminent launch is detected you have a few minutes, if you're lucky. The USA systems, which are the most advanced, have had numerous false alarms ranging from satellites to the Moon as being detected as warheads.

Russia and China have non responsive systems and each have their own flaws. Russia has unaccounted or unaudited stations which could at any time prime and fail to respond to orders to disarm. China has actually launched in the past and it's a miracle it didn't detonate. 

So the accident is from the fact you have little to no time to respond and most times, it's a false alarm, but in other countries they don't have the tools to discriminate accurately.

This could escalate quickly into a false strike, then an escalation, then multiple countries firing in retaliation, then an actual all out strike.

Made worse by the discovery that many operators don't even pay attention to their displays in these countries, USA included.",3,0,1443290820,1444723409
