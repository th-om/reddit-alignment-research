3l752z,Does it surprise you how well Bernie Sanders was treated at Liberty University?,96,Honest_Discussion,"Bernie Sanders recently gave a speech at Liberty University. For those who don't know, Liberty University was founded by Rev. Jerry Falwell and is decidedly conservative and Christian (something Sanders and his policies are decidedly not). Though he didn't receive the rousing applause he's used to at colleges (though there was some), what he also didn't receive is mass protest. He was not shouted down, boycotted, or disinvited. Students were also not given ""trigger warnings"" about what he had to say. They just sat there, listened, and made up their own opinion.

This is much different than how it is than it is when any Conservative speaker visits many Universities across the country. How do people feel about this?",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l752z/does_it_surprise_you_how_well_bernie_sanders_was/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442425811,1444727823
