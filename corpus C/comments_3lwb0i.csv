So when the FCC wants to start licensing a new use of spectrum where there are already incumbent users, the lobbyists for each industry come out in full force. Audio device manufacturers, theater owners, Broadway producers, and musicians groups may all wish to weigh in on rulemaking that affects wireless microphone usage. If it's happening in the TV bands, the broadcasters will want to protect their own interests. And if there's any possibility of licensed data networks, the wireless ISPs and big telecoms will get involved. Other players who have interests in spectrum regulation might be state/local government licensees (fire, police), aviation interests, tech companies that wish to use the spectrum, hobbyist organizations, medical users (hospitals and clinics), maritime groups, and other federal agencies (military, coast guard, other law enforcement, space agencies), as well as our foreign partners in cross-border or space issues. I've worked in spectrum licensing, and it would surprise you what kinds of organizations put together really compelling arguments that the FCC should or shouldn't take a particular course of action.

I think the key is to make sure factions (as described in the Federalist Papers) each get the regulators' ear. That way, regulation is largely democratic and informed, and the regulators have good transparent reasons for why they rejected some proposals and adopted others.

Somewhat ironically, my firsthand experience has been that the more money is at stake, the more democratic it tends to be - in large part because the smaller players can devote the time and resources to be heard on the topic.

If the regulator is interested in a particular result (e.g., safety requirements for auto glass, insulation properties for commercial building construction), the regulations need to be cost effective and not prone to loopholes defeating the purpose of the regulation. The main way that gets done is by being familiar with the industry practices and needs. So do the regulators mandate a particular manufacturing technique? Or do they prescribe a particular heat transfer or car collision test standard? Knowing which option to choose will require knowing the costs and the benefits of each approach. As the EPA has discovered with Volkswagen diesel ECU software, some tests can be gamed, so you want a balance of empirical results of particular tests (with the tests mimicking the real world conditions as well as possible), as well as certain best practices prescribed by regulation (I don't care how fireproof your building is, there must still be fire exits). It's a state of constant feedback and adjustment, and regulatory capture is best avoided by giving all stakeholders a voice.

Frankly, you don't seem to appreciate that other stakeholders have a serious interest in glass pane regulation. Apple will demand glass that meets certain physical characteristics for their phone screens, and regulations on the types of adhesives that may be used or imported might affect the choice of glass manufacturing technique used. Patents and trade secrets might give one particular glass manufacturer a competitive advantage so that they might favor something that is good for them personally but bad for their competitors.

And it's like that for every industry. Google's interests might be aligned with Verizon's for the purposes of allowing broad use of wireless spectrum for mobile devices, but those two companies will butt heads on net neutrality regulations. It happens all the time.",1,0,1442930190,1444725524

That is a valid point. But that also means you need people from the glass industry working as regulators. Even **without any influence peddling**, they will typically share the worldview of industry insiders and make regulations that the industry likes.

The fact that the next job for these people will most likely be in one of the companies they're regulating is an other factor pushing the world into regulatory capture without anyone doing anything improper.
