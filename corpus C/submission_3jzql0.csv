3jzql0,how to fix government :: money in politics,61,VaughnIlato,"
We probably have some common ground to start a discussion in that most Americans are not happy with our politicians, and one of the arguments cited as a root cause government problem is money in politics.  

Well, let's chart a course that argues that money is not the problem in politics.  As Americans, we have a political system that does not state a 
candidate for office requires a certain amount of money.  Rich and poor people can run for office.  We do not discriminate against candidates 
based to the amount of money someone has obtained during their life. 
You want to be Mayor, run for Mayor....

So if we take the money in politics off the table, and begin to analyze the
problems with our current leaders, one area stands out more than any
other, and that is access to the current and future politicians.  Without
frequent citizen access to politicians, our past, current, and future leaders
may have an occasional press conference, and during these press 
conferences the typical behavior of the politicians is to restate over and 
over the policies that they support and claim will make our nation great.
And as the press have become politicized, the soft ball press conferences
yield very little other than the blame game ==>>  it is those people 
obstructing progress.

So how to we fix this lack of access to our current and future leaders ?
The answer is simple, we start to demand that current politicians commit
to a weekly (or minimally every 2 weeks (nope, monthly is not enough))
press conferences, and these press conferences will be 2 hours in length,
with the first hour dedicated to the press asking questions, and the second
hour dedicated to the citizens asking questions.  There will be no opening
address by the politicians as these news conferences are to be question
and answer by the press and citizens.  Including the citizen questions here
is paramount to also fixing the politicized press as, well, I do not claim to
be wise or smart or knowledgeable, yet I can come up with questions
that will help to drill down to what the obstacles are for pretty much any
topic.  It is so easy....so let's take a swing and apply this practice to our
current situation with Hillary Clinton and the email situation.  The question
(set) that I would ask Mrs Clinton is  :

As we are a nation of laws, and a government for the people and by the
people, how did your setting up the private email server for the State
Department activities help all Americans ?  and when the Freedom of
Information requests and Congressional requests for emails were
received, why did your team not say ""hey, the emails that you all are 
looking for are over here on this clintonemail.com server"" ?

Maybe Mrs Clinton has reasonable answers to these questions, and 
these questions seem reasonable to be asked to Mrs Clinton, yet, the 
press has not yet asked these questions even when given the opportunity
to address Mrs Clinton.

Just think of the questions us citizens could ask of any of our politicians:
what did you do on Monday ?  what did you do on Tuesday ?  Wednesday ?  These simple questions will pay great dividends as when we start 
receiving answers such as ""well on Monday I was golfing with xzy 
executive and then we went to a cocktail party""...

Would that not be great, to find out what these leaders of ours are actually
doing on a day-to-day basis.  My prediction here is that the public would
become pretty angry when we learned that our leaders are not working
tirelessly for the American people to make our lives better, and giving all
attention to us, the people, rather than what ever these politicians are up
to today which has resulted in the gridlock in government.

Is our government setup for the convenience of the politician ?  Let's take
convenience off the table, and begin to demand access to our politicians,
as if we do not take a path of this type (or other better paths?), the 
government gridlock will continue.

Let me conclude with the statement, yes, I am not in favor on Hillary 
Clinton to even run for any office in the country.  And I am not in favor of 
any Bush ever having public office again.  It is time for a new direction, 
and recycling these politicians has lead to our current dysfunctional government state. People, we can do better, and to do better, we must demand access to our political leaders.
 
And would it not be at least entertaining to have our current group of
Presidential candidates show us how they will be very accessible if elected
to the Presidency by scheduling these weekly press conferences ?  When
we hear Mrs Clinton state something like ""only the press is asking me these email questions"", well, Mrs Clinton, you will be surprised as let's just
take a swing at a number, let's say that maybe 50 to 100 million Americans
would like to hear the answers to these 2 simple questions we asked
