3l7ift,Separation of religion and governance is 100% impossible.,11,FranticOne,"In Christianity, It is written that the rulers, the authorities are chosen by god.  And it's tenets follow from that belief.

In Islam, it is written that Muslim's must be united into a caliphate.

Most religion's are so intertwined within governance no separation can occur.  If a religious majority exists in a democratic country, then the country cannot have separation of religion and governance.  

In America, Perhaps we should make a law against an individual both voting and practicing religion, when their religion dictates that there cannot be separation.  Any better ideas?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l7ift/separation_of_religion_and_governance_is_100/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442431264,1444727800
