cvicoun,1,t3_3mv339,lollersauce914,"Well, for every ""vaccine"" example where the majority is wrong there's a ""Nixon/Kissinger"" counter-example to show where the idea of leaving decision making to the experts leads. Nixon and Kissinger wiretapped their own staff in order to prevent leaks on the pretense of national security when, in reality, the taps served obvious political purposes (keeping stories from the American public).

To some extent, the republican nature of our government is an admission that governing should be left to experts.

cvifmz2,0,t1_cvicoun,Einsteinsmooostache,"Ehhh, I agree with you for most cases, but the fact of the matter is some things need to be kept secret from the public. Most of our foreign policy decisions (even if I disagree) should be made behind the scenes. 

In a perfect world, sure let all decisions be made in a glass room - but in dealing with countries like Russia, China, N Korea, Iran, etc. we need to keep our decision making on a need to know basis lest they gain too much insight. Foreign policy is a high stakes chess game, no reason to give away secrets to a clever gambit. 

And to really drive you nuts, I'm pro Nixon. He did some terrible things, but did them in terrible times. Ultimately I think Nixon played a huge part in the US winning the Cold War. ",1,0,1443555208,1444722149

That doesn't mean bombing Cambodia or Laos actually helped winning the cold war or a good move from a realpolitik perspective.

And turned out to be pointless in the end when the NVA marched into Saigon. Avoiding an escalation OTOH would have saved the US significant resources and lives of American soldiers for pretty much the same result. Vietnam was a -defeat- for the US even if it did win the cold war so using policies regarding Vietnam as example of smart decisions is pretty suspect.

cvifjxm,0,t1_cvicoun,DeSoulis,"Just to add to this, the whole ""democracy vs experts"" thing is a very, very American phenomenon and results from a political culture which is anti-intellectual, thinks ""bureaucrat"" is a dirty word, and distrusts the government.

This isn't nearly as big of an issue in European countries where bureaucracies have a much higher degree of trust and experts are employed by bureaucracies and engage in technocratic decision making process which are generally accepted by the public. 

America is really unique in how democracy and technocratic knowledge goes against each other, at least in the first world.",1,0,1443555094,1444722149
cviibwc,1,t3_3mv339,GTFErinyes,"This is an example of why the country is a republic, with democratically elected officials. And this was designed so that it wouldn't represent everyone's views - instead, it was created so that a popular opinion couldn't become a ""tyranny of the masses"" over minority or dissenting views and instead be ruled by those who could be given a lot of evidence or reports on issues before making *informed* decisions.

Indeed, for all the hate around lobbyists and special interest groups, they exist also precisely because we want our elected officials to be informed. After all, they can provide reports on the effects of proposed policy and lobby on their cause - whether it is a member of an oil lobby or an environmentalist lobby, or an automotive union or an auto executive, etc. they're supposed to present views to leadership who can then make said informed decision.

Of course, this isn't perfect - there are flaws such as when said elected officials do not do their job and instead implement *more*-divisive policies or policies that silence or crush dissenting views or opinions. And there are flaws when said elected officials do not make the best informed decision, and instead make decisions that benefit him/herself only, or only specific constituents or groups - at the expense of others. 

On the flip side, running a nation with *just* experts - technocrats - like a country like China has its own problem. For one, it often stifles public opinion and the public voice - after all, it doesn't mater if something affects you differently than the rest of the masses, it's been deemed good for you and you have little recourse besides taking on the bureaucracy of government. 

And this also means that minority views and human factors are often ignored. If building a dam is what experts deem to be the most efficient use of land, in a technocratic society, it gets built. But the voices of environmentalists, the owners of the land that gets affected, etc. may be overruled because their concerns are less important than what the experts say is ""best""

An example of both of these scenarios, actually, comes in the Korean War. After the North Koreans invaded South Korea in 1950, President Truman sent US troops - backed by a UN mandate - to defend South Korea.

This war was extremely unpopular with the US populace - just 5 years after WW2 had ended, many in the US didn't want to send our troops to fight on behalf of a nation most had never heard of at that point. Indeed, President Eisenhower made it a major part of his presidential campaign to *end* the war in Korea.

Yet, today, most people are happy to see South Korea as it is, and not what North Korea is, and you'd find that most people support defending South Korea against the North to this day. However, if you had left it to the masses to decide back then, we may see the Kim dynasty in charge of a unified Korea today.

On the flip side, leaving it up to the experts with the Korean War may have ended up resulting in an even larger conflict. General MacArthur, the preeminent military mind in the Pacific region, wanted US troops to go to the Yalu and push into China - with atomic weapons if necessary - to end the communist threat once and for all.

Truman of course ended up firing MacArthur for insubordination. Now, whether MacArthur's foray north and into China would have resulted in WW3, the collapse of Mao, or whatever we can't say for certain. We can, however, say that if we had just left it up to the ""experts"" instead of our elected leadership, the world may have ended up a very different place as well.",5,0,1443558932,1444722149

Healthy people are better motivated by autonomy, mastery and purpose. Purpose being creating a healthy humane society. Positive reinforcements, not negative force - conform to your owners' wishes or starve is what the profit motive has devolved into. They seem to have sucked this normalcy out of you.


>Perhaps you ought step away from your idealism for a moment, because you seem to have neglected human nature itself,

Arrogant much? The only human nature is that of survival - and with our progression to the ability and desire to reason with empathy, which you seem to have suppressed, that means caring for others, as a society. 






>all humans are by their nature greedy

The only people telling you this are narcissists stealing you blind. The mentally ill. This is who you listen to.

People would profit, just not at the expense of others.

Practically no one in your insular world. The rest of us are suffering on the busts of capitalism - as the booms only benefit a few, the busts condemn the rest of us. They are still going through the bandaids that don't work, but with propagandized hope.

Yes, yes I do. It misdirects and depletes our resources. We have enough to get every person on this earth out of poverty but capitalism chooses not to. Is that not cruel?

*You* should pause to consider that you are ignoring the owners and only describing the slaves' conditions. The capitalists' profit is valued as their self esteem. Oh, I'm not talking about the small business owners, slaves to the 1%. They are no better off than the workers, just to a slight degree.
