3k8jhr,What happened to Scott Walker's campaign and can he recover?,65,garfangle,"Walker was leading the GOP field in Iowa since February until mid-July when Trump surpassed him by the start of August. After the first debate where he was a top three candidate on the stage, Walker has been in free fall with the most recent polls placing him in the mid-single digits if not lower. He is nearing Chris Christie territory, not in terms of favorability which remains high, but in terms of relevance to capturing the nomination.

What has Walker done, if anything, that has caused his polling to  plummet in the eyes of Republican primary voters and what can he do to get them back up in time for the Iowa caucuses? Does he have to wait from the Trump/Carson phenomenon to pass or is there something proactive he can do to jump start his campaign? Should Walker confront, ignore or do something else to get media attention away from Trump and onto the message he wants voters to hear?",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3k8jhr/what_happened_to_scott_walkers_campaign_and_can/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441803651,1444731298
