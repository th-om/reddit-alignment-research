3mdyvd,"If the idea of a woman being elected POTUS had been anticipated, do you think the 22nd Amendment would have treated POTUS and first-spouse as one in limiting them to two-terms?",20,TelescopeFeed,"As unimaginable as a woman POTUS must have been at the time (late 40’s early 50’s), it was also a time when women were expected to be obedient to their husbands.  Given that mindset isn’t it reasonable to suggest that the 22nd Amendment would have limited the POTUS and his/her spouse to two-terms?

I ask the question this way because if you look at the whole of Bill and Hillary’s partnership (two for one, as he liked to put it), it’s hard not to see her as someone Bill selected to further his political career, and if Hillary was agreeable/malleable to that role, how is employing her to seek the office of the presidency not simply the next logical avenue for Bill in the continuation of his political aspirations.  In other words, he found a loophole in the 22nd Amendment and is exploiting it.
