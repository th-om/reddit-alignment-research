Story mode ON: Years ago I received a pamphlet in the mail that made the claim that my current representative had voted to raise taxes on the elderly. In very small print in a color similar to the background it listed the house bill that this person had voted on that raised taxes on the elderly. I looked it up. It was about 200 pages, but I plugged away at it. After some additional cross referencing I found a sentence that would revoke the tax free status of retired railway worker pension funds if they then worked another job and later claimed social security as well (double dipping tax free retirements).

It was a part of a larger appropriations bill that had passed with bipartisan support. This would have made about 70% of the house guilty of raising taxes on the elderly.


Then I looked up information on the group that had sent out the pamphlet. They also enjoyed bipartisan support, they ran negative ads against anybody you wanted if you had the money.

Until someone has demonstrated actual ignorance (not just ""interprets information differently"", but ""states a fact which is untrue""), I wouldn't call them ignorant at all.

For example, someone who disagrees with *Citizens United* can be entirely reasonable and well-informed.  My view is far from being considered gospel among lawyers, and well-reasoned disagreement is kind of what we do, so I can fully respect a layperson who argues that there *is* a compelling government interest in stopping disproportionate political advocacy.

And it originated as a widespread tactic [in the Democratic Party](http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/27117-gerrymandering-a-plague-on-both-our-parties), enabling them to rule Congress with an iron fist for 40 years.  Funny how it wasn't an issue until the GOP finally wised up and started beating you at your own game.

Also, the impact of Republican gerrymandering is nowhere near as big a factor as Democrats claim.

You would naturally assume from this that the seats would split along the same lines: 8 D and 8 R. Yet in congressional seats, the Republicans control 12/16.

Well, competitiveness is not the same thing as fairness.  But we can move on.

>This is because the Republican controlled statehouse drew those districts in a way that lumps all of the Democrats into four districts, allowing them to carry the rest.

There's a certain irony that folks in your camp attack ""gerrymandering"" both on the basis that it creates too little competition (safe districts where one party will win almost by default, creating stagnation) and too much (competitive districts where the winning party takes the seat by a slim majority).

But in reality, what you're noticing is the result of geographic self-selection.  Democrats and Republicans are not evenly distributed throughout a state, so attempts to create competitive districts (which you claim is what you want) result in weird districts which have to combine a Republican stronghold with a Democratic one.

Look, for example, at Colorado.  The Colorado 1st is almost 70% Democratic, and Diane DeGette is going to win until she dies.  And probably even then, an emaciated DeGette corpse would take the district in a landslide for a few cycles.  There's no way to carve out that support into other districts without literally splitting the Denver-metro area into chunks, so instead you have a small consolidated group of Democratic voters, and then attempts to create competitive districts elsewhere.

I'll add only an interesting bit of analysis:

>what you're noticing is the result of geographic self-selection

Bullshit. I could easily draw the districts in a way that they would be competitive, geographically compact, and fair to both parties. The results would most likely be 8 districts which lean Democratic and 8 which lean Republican. ",1,0,1442282499,1444729202

All right, hit me.  You can get Colorado census and voting data fairly easily.  Show me the Congressional districts without having to weirdly divide Denver into four different districts and which doesn't require any weird-looking districts.
