It's a bit long, but if you're going to pretend like you know what you're talking about, you might as well skim over it.

The only thing, and I mean the *only* thing, the Heritage Plan and the ACA have in common is that the both contain a ""mandate"" that requires people to obtain some level of coverage. However, this mandated coverage by the Heritage Plan is only for ""catastrophic"" situations, not every-day healthcare needs like what the ACA covers (ie- prescription drugs, preventative care, etc.).

And while this small similarity is in reality a huge difference, it's where all other similarities end:

- The ACA put substantially more restrictions on the private health insurance industry; the HP would have substantially reduced restrictions.

- The ACA preserved most employer provided insurance; The HP planned to eliminate employer provided insurance.

- The ACA drastically expanded Mediciad to unprecedented levels; The HP would have greatly diminished federal involvement in the program.

- The ACA preserves Medicare as is; The HP would have turned it into a voucher system.

Nelson claims that the Nebraska provision was added as a placeholder that was intended to be replaced by a similar provision that covered all states.

Yes, much like the president has things he won't compromise on.  That's why a person willing to compromise brings things they *are* willing to compromise on to the table.

>  Heck the president was giving a 3:1 ratio! If I was the GOP I would of ran with that and called it a win and say yes we had to give in a bit on revenue

That's not a win when so much of your existence is predicated on lowering tax rates.  History shows it's very difficult to get those back, and also hard to make spending cuts stick.  That's not a good deal for Republicans, nor does it show any compromise from Obama, especially when he ran on a net spending cut and a middle class tax cut already.

> . You say the President didn't want to work with the GOP yet here you point to something the GOP wasn't willing to budge on at all even though the President was giving them a great deal.

Obama Says ""I won"" in a 2009 article about the stimulus package.  It's speaking primarily to conservatives (both politicians and electorate) in order to suggest that Obama is an effective leader.  It speaks to the general public in order to communicate a current event.  It speaks to democrats to celebrate a success.  It is written by two political correspondents, one focusing often on Republicans, and the other focusing primarily on Democrats.

To analyze rhetoric you need source, audience, purpose.

The same thing is going on with the narratives about who is at fault with the legislative gridlock.

A source writing to either party base today and in the coming months will have no purpose other than rallying a demographic base, so it's either going to be ""we're right"" or ""they're wrong"".  A source (god help them) writing to analyze the situation for the general public will fail, since election years/ primary season demands partisanship, and frankly the truth in politics is entirely subjective.  Was it the republicans in congress, the president and his veto pen, was it the framers' intent in creating the constitution?.  

Concluding it was Obama's fault will narrow the audience to conservatives, since liberals will not accept that, while concluding it was the republican-lead legislature's fault will likewise narrow the audience, and concluding it was the framer's intent is boring so nobody will read it.

A lot of what you've seen is normal.  Redditors are just too often too young to understand it.  They can't remember how it has been throughout other administrations.  I mean, try to keep in mind that the average Redditor has only ever been politically aware of one president, Obama.  That really skews their perception.  And they haven't learned all the different ways the media and campaigns have of making it seem like they are victims of some kind of unique prejudice.  They'll realize it in time, though. 

Obama said from the onset he didn't intend to work with Republicans, and they said pretty much the exact same thing.  That's normal.  What isn't normal is how some of the negotiations over legislation have gone.  Obama has been somewhat unique in that regard in that he genuinely feels like he is entitled to dictate every term of every bill Congresses passes.  No president in my lifetime has ever done that to the degree Obama does, especially after record breaking losses for his party in the midterms.  Bill Clinton blustered after the losses in '94, but he ultimately went to table with Gingrich and negotiated a mutually palatable agreement.  Obama is uniquely incapable of this, though. 

Now, it's not Obam's personality or anything that makes him this way.  It's his politics that necessitate it.  You see, Obama's platform hinged so much on the idea that Republicans are evil and bad at everything that it is one of the only effective rallying cries he had going for him his first four years.  That's why he needed Reid and Pelosi to do the jobs they did.  When Obama did reach out and worked with Republicans, Reid would block the bill and talk about how awful the Republicans were.  If Republicans worked with Reid, Obama would threaten a veto.  There was always this back and forth where they tried balancing getting governing done with keeping the anti-Bush/Republican base energized and on their side.  Much legislation failed as a result of this process. 

The Republicans dealt with the exact same phenomenon, but in their case there was a different problem to overcome, the fact that they actually had dozens of those anti-Obama/Democrat activists win seats in Congress.  Those people were willing to be wrecking balls as long as it meant the Democrats didn't get anything they wanted.  You're seeing that play out some now with the potential ousting of Boehner.

So, it's not a one party blame issue.  It's complicated, and there are many typical elements of the issue and a few unique ones.  In a way it's really us, the American people, who are to blame.  We are increasingly polarized and keep rewarding officials for obstruction for the sake of obstruction.  And, when you honestly reflect on the state of your party or even just read the musings of your fellow Redditors you'll see it.
