My guess is that they trusted the electoral process to weed out anyone weak enough to be controlled by a close relation.  Voters are unlikely to support someone who appears weak like that, and if Hillary were nothing more than a mouthpiece for Bill that would show up, especially in her debate performance.

cve886g,1,t3_3mdyvd,MrIvysaur,"I think not.  In the case of Bill and Hillary, I, and most other Americans, see Hillary as her own person with distinct views.  Which I honestly think is too bad, 'cuz I think Bill's hella smarter/realer than she is.

You also you can't just switch off the deep dependency you develop after decades of following your husband's lead.

cvejjdc,0,t1_cve921j,rikross22,"I think this is a fundamental misunderstanding of Hillary Clinton. She hasn't just followed bill hopelessly, she's been her own person and incredibly successful. Did his election help her? Certainly but this is a woman who has worked in politics since her college days, who turned down bill's first few marriage proposals because she didn't want to just be lumped in with him and had her own aspirations, when they first got married she retained her own last name to keep independence only changing it when he asked for election purposes. As First Lady of Arkansas she still worked as a top rainmaker At a large form and served on many boards for major companies. She was politically involved in a number of things on her own and was the most active First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt. She's always had her own dreams and aspirations and has worked on attaining them not just being tied to her very successful husband.  ",2,0,1443242717,1444723668

cve9ecg,0,t1_cve908q,TelescopeFeed,While Bill was seeking office I would say her taking a more liberal position was a convenient way for him to position himself more to the center and thereby broadening his appeal.

By your logic why couldn't we assume that she controls Bill and got him elected to further her political career? She's the one the found the loophole.
