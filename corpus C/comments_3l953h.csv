cv4ch5y,1,t3_3l953h,FlyingFistsOfFury,"""Illegals will do jobs that Americans won't"" is kind of like ""Black lives matter"" in that it has an implicit second part.  The full thing is:

""Illegals will do jobs that Americans won't do for the shitty pay that is being offered.""",17,0,1442462300,1444727760
cv5hpoy,0,t1_cv4ch5y,HeloRising,"That's not necessarily true.

The phrase really out to be ""Illegals are being hired to do jobs that Americans won't get hired for.""

I've tried doing a lot of the jobs that undocumented immigrants are usually hired for (picking fruit was the clearest example) and I was told several times straight out ""You will not get hired because you're white."" It's not that they hate white people, it's that they don't want someone who might know something about labor laws and be able to call the authorities without fear of deportation.

Undocumented immigrants can be used up like consumable parts and thrown away with very little effort. American workers need things like insurance, minimum wage, labor standards, breaks, time off, etc. Why do that when you can hire someone fresh off the bus for a fraction of the cost and none of those other pesky regulations that cost more?",1,0,1442546581,1444727760
cv4bbkb,1,t3_3l953h,ThreeCranes,"First of all this isn't that a fictional movie?

> With that being said, I think American's will do any job as long as the price is right.

I do agree with you however having to raise wages for jobs such as farm workers could lead to an increase in food prices(this negatively affects all Americans and the economy as other sectors based on luxuries and entertainments will see less money) or could potentially shut down commercial farms. As for jobs like landscaping and house cleaning  a wage increase  could lead smaller companies to downsizing workers or going out of business.",3,0,1442459971,1444727760
cv4be3u,0,t1_cv4bbkb,warrenfgerald,I thought we had a wealth gap problem in this country? Wouldn't raising wages of low skilled workers help with that gap? ,1,0,1442460104,1444727760
cv4bju1,0,t1_cv4be3u,ThreeCranes,We do and it would help with that just I want to point out that economic consequences could result by such a move. Who knows maybe the benefits of increasing wages for low skilled labor outweigh potential negative parts,3,0,1442460412,1444727763

cv4fn68,0,t1_cv4ejle,KKV,"Of course you would. America is not going to stop producing food leading to everyone starving because farm labor is being paid more than $4 an hour.

Farmers are some of the most entitled, whiny little shits I can think of. Somehow they think they are exempt from normal economics when everyone else isn't.",5,0,1442470428,1444727763
cv4otdd,0,t1_cv4fn68,FlyingFistsOfFury,"Farmers by and large aren't ""little shits"" at all, because almost all farming now is ultimately done for the profit of major corporations.

cv4fzu0,1,t3_3l953h,iuseoxyclean,"To piggyback off of /r/ge93, also keep in mind that low agriculture wages are helping keep food costs down in an already heavily subsidized market. In California, for instance, price of food is going way up because of the drought and increased regulations, and its starting to become rather absurd (Beef costs 10 bucks/lb). If they had to pay real wages and benefits to harvest crops, then the price of food will go up even higher. Which will drive up the cost of living. And etc etc.

Also you need certifications to clean up certain biohazard sites, which usually take some money investment and probably some kind of legal documentation (Especially as a crime scene cleanup).",2,0,1442471579,1444727767
cv4a4et,1,t3_3l953h,ge93,"The phrase is not really relevant to the overall debate.

Illegal immigrants by their nature are only really able to perform low-skill labour, while helping grow the economy through the spending. This growth raises the wages of ordinary American and probably contributes to a net-job gain for American citizens. So jobs aren't ""stolen"" from American citizens.",4,0,1442457794,1444727767
cv4b3nt,0,t1_cv4a4et,warrenfgerald,How does paying an illegal immigrant $5 per hour cash under the table help increase wages for the rest of Americans? I would think the opposite is true.

cv4fanp,1,t3_3l953h,brinz1,"For Biohazard cleanups, the crew who clean that up have to be specially qualified and approved by state and federal regulations. This is for the purposes of public saftey and ensuring a proper job is done but has the side effect of making it a closed shop job that not just anyone can pick up a mop and do.


I am sure plenty of illegal immigrants do clean up biohazard sites, but it is kept as an under the table job.",1,0,1442469353,1444727767

You find that they magically somehow raise pay? Great! You get published. Find the obvious truth that they lower them. Sorry, we're not interested in that answer.

cv4llr8,0,t1_cv4c4k2,Lambchops_Legion,"Don't believe that guy, he's willing to discredit any study that doesn't line up with his own priors. Immigration lowers bottom-tier wages in the short term, but in how the economy restructures itself, all native wages are raised in the long-term.

The theory is that if your wages &lt; than your marginal product of labor, you'll go to a firm that will pay higher wages. If you are at a firm where your wages > your marginal product of labor, the firm realizes they can make an economic profit in laying you off and hiring someone with lower wages. Thus, in perfect competition, equilibrium wages = MPL as everything shakes out.",1,0,1442493220,1444727767
