cvjlu5u,1,t3_3mzpk4,maddata,"You're painting with kind of broad strokes.  You can be both a 'leftist' and an authoritarian, just like you can be right leaning and anarchistic.  The political spectrum is multidimensional, and It's really tough to boil it down to left and right.  If you want to define Left as anarchistic, and Right as authoritarian, then yes your assessment is decent.

But if we're going to dip into some practical differences between the left and the right, *in America*, it's definitely not as clear cut. 

The left is not calling for an abolition of hierarchy, for instance.  A key element of the Democratic platform is the limitation of raw economic freedom for popular benefit.  Conversely, the 'right' concerns itself with expanding economic freedom.

On the other hand, the left wants to expand certain social and personal freedoms (e.g. disallowing gay marriage establishes a social hierarchy), while the right wants to limit some freedoms (e.g. controlling what kinds of mind altering substances a person may use).

Really what you think the ""Left"" and the ""Right"" represent in terms of politics depends almost entirely on the context.  A matter of convention (according to Wikipedia stemming from the french revolution), the ""Left"" is typically awarded to the opinions that are populist or progressive, while the ""Right"" is used to refer to conservative or aristocratic viewpoints.",5,0,1443639554,1444721409

The book, in case you didn't know, denounced both private property and the state as hierarchical and thieving.

Also, a fun line from the most famous communist and socialist anthem of all time, *The Internationale*:

> L'État comprime et la loi triche

> L'impôt saigne le malheureux

> Nul devoir ne s'impose au riche

As a matter of fact, the anarchist movement and Marxism weren't even considered *separate* until the first meeting of the International Workingmen's association, where the anarchists and Marxists fought over whether a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" should be used to achieve socialism. The anarchists said it shouldn't; Marxists said it was necessary.

Sadly, I think this is partially true. Since the tea party has gained more power, there has been this move towards ""gut truth"" (what Colbert famously called truthiness) and away from empirical evidence and academic literature. It baffles me the amount of people who straight up tell me that its all goverment conspiracy (usually phrased as ""follow the money"", a phrase that originally was used to talk to document the month long tracking of money used in watergate to CREEP, but now apparently just means that research dollars come from research grants). 

Obviously this isnt true of all conservatives and there are liberals who certainly fit this bill, but it worries me that conservatives who are well educated and well versed in many areas of science, sociology, and economics dont notice the growing trend of ""Get your government  hands off my Medicare"" types.
