As a fairly pro-gun control dem, I don't see the point of this. Sue the gun manufacturer? I think potentially suing the gun shop that sold the gun would make sense, but the manufacturer? Meh. I dont like the idea of over-litigation just for litagating disasters.

>another is to make the three-day background check period a mandatory ""deny"" if the feds don't get back to the gun dealer before the time expires

This is more reasonable. If a background check isn't performed, no gun should be sold. Though my suggestion would be to not make it auto-fail, but to do away with the 3 day wait, period. The background check will go through when it does. Either pass or fail, now everyone gets a background check and your worries about abuse becomes nonexistent.

>a vague declaration to ban ""military type"" weapons.

Will do nothing. But, since according to you full size AR15s are ""useful"" could you tell me how they are useful to the average citizen? I know if I wanted to protect myself or my family I would choose a shotgun or pistol over an ""assault rifle.""

That wasn't me. But in truth a .223 AR-15 is probably a better home defense weapon than a handgun or shotgun. It is less likely to penetrate walls and has very little recoil. It holds a lot of cartridges in case a lot are needed. It's lightweight. You could get a ton more info on this from the experts over in /r/firearms . ",3,0,1444090943,1444717784

Why should they sell you a gun if the background check doesn't go through? Again, if you already own guns this shouldn't really impact you. 

>and a vague declaration to ban ""military type"" weapons.

So the most ""extreme"" thing would be a reinstatement of the assaults weapon ban. Anything you have before the ban you get to keep. And if you don't then basically it means you'll have to buy a gun with the right modifications to it so it's compliant with the law.

""The real story is that guns have become a key part of Republican partisan self-identification since the dawn of the Obama era. Republicans and Democrats have seen the gun control issue differently for decades. But not that differently. Democrats strongly supported gun control. And Republicans were basically divided on the issue. As Pew's Carroll Doherty noted in this Pew write-up, ""as recently as 2007, 48% of Republicans and GOP leaners said it was more important to control gun ownership, while 47% said it was more important to protect gun rights.""

The dawn of the Obama era brought a transformation that you can see powerfully in this chart of Pew data over the last quarter century.""  See the rest of the article for more.

Allowing idiotic litigation against the gun makers raises the cost and ""stupidity level"" of guns.

On that latter point:

Late in the Bill Clinton administration threats were made against Smith & Wesson, the biggest handgun maker.  As an act of appeasement they put in a lock and key system to allow disabling the action.  Sounds great but it is universally despised because it's not a practical safety system and under heavy recoil it can automatically engage, tying the gun up - potentially in the middle of a self defense situation.

Assault weapons, as described by the left because they made up that term, are used the least of all guns in crimes. It would outlaw my AR15, it would probably outlaw my historical M1 carbine (yet not my M1 garand, because reasons, despite it being an accual used in the military gun). Not only that, but because all gun types had at one point, and still are used in the military (Bolt action rifles where the norm pre ww2, now they are still used as sniper rifles. Semi autos were used primarily into korean war, then replaced by an automatic M14, which was replaced in viet nam by the M16, Revolvers were heavily used in WW2 and every other gun type, musket, rolling block, flintlock, was used prior to the first krege bolt action rifle.) So if we extrapolate 'military type' to 'any gun used in the military at some point' she could refer to a ban on all guns, though I bet she is only talking about semi auto rifles that are painted black and made partly of plastic.

Lastly, we can't sue a car manufacturer for someone using a car wrong and running someone over, we can't sue a hammer manufacturer because a criminal bashed someones head in with a hammer, how the fuck do we rationalize suing gun manufacturers for the same thing? Its not illegal to sue a gun manufacturer if it was a defect in the gun that caused harm, such as a faulty trigger or safety, but its another thing to have someone use the product illegally and sue because someone used it illegally, its just nonsense and asinine.",7,0,1444068573,1444717832

>>Some might call Hillary's decision to ""go all in"" as unwise, but obviously she is playing to her base at this point
  
You've asked and answered your own question. Hillary doesn't give a flying patoot about single issue pro-gun voters that are more likely to be republicans anyway. She's trying to win. Obviously her staff weighed the pros and cons of making the statement, and she disagrees with your assessment that being anti-gun is a guaranteed election loss. Though to be fair, I think you're polarizing the issue.

Wanting some regulations on gun ownership is not ""anti-gun"". It is pro-regulation on guns. I understand that every position needs to be as simple as a light switch for some people, but gun ownership is an issue with enough nuance to have more than a total of 2 positions. I believe that you should be able to own a gun within limits. Those limits are blurry, and can only really be determined through acts of the courts and Congress. It's no different from most other freedoms, where we weigh your right vs. the safety and rights of others.
