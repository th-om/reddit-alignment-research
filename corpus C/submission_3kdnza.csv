3kdnza,"Given the most recent revelations about the administrations knowledge of terrorist activities, lack of action, and their awareness of weapons shipping to Syria from Benghazi, do you find yourself reevaluating your position on the Obama administration's foreign policy?",23,DevonWeeks,"To provide the most recently release information, I'll use the Judicial Watch article.  It has the most links to all of the primary sources of any page I've seen.

Does this information cause you to question the overall foreign policy decision making process of the Obama administration?  Do you read these documents and conclude that any of this was a ""good"" or ""wise"" thing to do?  It seems like previous administrations going all the way back to Carter had their foreign policy agenda called into question for far less than this at times.  Do you perceive a unique reluctance to do so regarding the Obama administration?  Given that the documents redact who exactly was shipping the weapons to Syria, do you see a potential for another Iran-Contra type situation?

Just to head this off at the pass, ignore the last paragraph in the source.  I would hope we're all mature enough to expect a politician to lie for political gain.  I couldn't care less about if a video got blamed or not.  I'm more concerned with what the documents reveal about their handling of foreign policy and national security.  I personally find this to be revealing of a remarkable lack of competency.

EDIT:  On a lighter note, whoever the analyst is that wrote this...

>The deterioration of the situation has dire consequences on the Iraqi situation and are as follows:

>This creates the ideal atmosphere for AQI [al Qaeda Iraq] to return to its old pockets in Mosul and Ramadi, and will provide a renewed momentum under the presumption of unifying the jihad among Sunni Iraq and Syria, and the rest of the Sunnis in the Arab world against what it considers one enemy, the dissenters. ISI could also declare an Islamic state through its union with other terrorist organizations in Iraq and Syria, which will create grave danger in regards to unifying Iraq and the protection of its territory.
