cuyqng8,1,t3_3klmzn,yabbadabbadoo1,"There is a risk to any interview as well as the reward of exposure. If you make a mistake it could be campaign ending, unless you are Trump of course. He is more comfortable and since he talks off the cuff always, even if he says something wrong he can play it off like that. Other candidates can't do this, it isn't believable.

For instance, Hillary avoids interviews, has only done two since her email scandal (CNN and Ellen). Trump goes on fox, MSNBC, CNN , the view, the tonight show, multiple radio interviews, ect. He doesn't see it as a risk, just reward and he gets ratings so everyone will put him on. I think he did something like 3 interviews yesterday alone, plus his twitter and other social media feeds that were picked up by networks.",4,0,1442034992,1444729843
cuyu5mp,1,t3_3klmzn,greatgramba,"Because here's what happens when you go on tv and you're not Donald Trump. No one gives a shit because you're boring, you don't pull in ratings, and the media's got a bottom line to worry about. If you do try and say the kind of things Trump does, you're going to upset liberals, SJWs, and liberal pundits. They then find out who donates money to you and throw a bitch fit. Your rich corporate donors don't like getting bad publicity so they tell you to shut the fuck up and go apologize. And you do. You need their damn money because you're not a filthy rich multi-billionaire real estate mogul who can fund his own campaign. 

That's why these other guys can't compete with Trump. They can either be boring but well funded or they can be headline grabbers who's campaign's are in the poor house. Trump is the only one who can steal all the headlines while still having a mountain of cash lying around to bury the competition in. ",3,0,1442048212,1444729843

cuze7fl,0,t1_cuzcxdu,greatgramba,"Did you just stop reading right after that sentence?

Let me try to explain this again. They don't care and that doesn't matter. Their corporate donors, on the other hand, care very much if those comments get linked back to them and cost them business because crazy SJWs, who attack and boycott anything that dares to have a different opinion than them, blew it up into a huge media shitstorm. 

If someone like senior Jeb! or Walker tried to go out and say the same things as Trump every non-fox media outlet and all of social media would be out on a witch hunt for the companies giving them money. Those companies in turn would call up those candidates and tell them they need to either stop or apologize or their not getting anymore money.

Trump on the other hand can't be shut up by going after his donors since he is self funded so he can say whatever the fuck he wants. Which is why he pulls in such huge ratings and that's why no one else can compete with him for media attention.

cuytg63,1,t3_3klmzn,DevonWeeks,"Some of it is good strategy.  If you're competing with Trump, you want him to keep running his mouth until he goes over the line and says something that damages him.  Then you pounce.  If I was running in the primary against him, I'd be laying low for now and watching his press coverage like a hawk.  The moment he opens his mouth and inserts his foot, I'd be hitting every news channel I could talking about my agenda and, when inevitably asked about Trump, taking the ""high ground"" and putting forth a more professional image.

cuzez1x,1,t3_3klmzn,yankeesyes,"The election is more than 1 year away.  Trump is a passing fancy for the media.  His plans are unworkable and unserious.  Any candidate, Republican or Democrat, would be wise to ignore him and focus on their own plan. The people who matter aren't paying attention anyway.

The public that is coming out for polls for Trump likes Trump the media personality.  That's quite different than entrusting him to be the most powerful person on Earth.",0,0,1442096239,1444729843
