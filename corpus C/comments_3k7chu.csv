Dude,I have friends who were screaming about how Abbot was manipulating the media and how he was sexist, rightwing loon before his government was elected.  If you thought he was somewhat normal, I'd say it indicates that you weren't paying too close attention.

Obama, *in 2008*, said he would expand the drone campaign and use them over countries without those countries approval, and people act shocked that, well, he did just that.  

It's an oddly common theme for ""regular people"" to assume things about major political candidates that are not in keeping in line with what they said they'll do.  Trump has always been over the top, and it's early in the campaign, so the crazy is really out in force.  Crap, Scott Walker said he would kill a woman(""no exemptions for abortions even if the mother's life was at risk"") during the first GOP debate, and everyone is still talking about Trump.",4,0,1441786645,1444731344

Also, check out the [poll numbers.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/) Donald Trump is far and away the Republican front-runner and is now beating Democrats nationally, which means he has significant moderate/independent support.

cuvhzzm,1,t3_3k7chu,HeloRising,">Is he REALLY in with a shot?

No. As much as people make a bunch of noise about him, either for or against, Trump is not going to be the next president for a couple of reasons.

First, his early success means next to nothing. To massively oversimplify a grossly complex process, this period in the electoral cycle means nothing because the two main political parties haven't yet selected the candidates they're going to run in the general election. There are elections that precede the general election called primary elections (aka ""primaries"") and you also have large gatherings of the main parties called conventions. Through that process a frontrunner usually gets selected to run in the general election.

So basically you have to win a couple of elections before you can run for the presidency. In theory you can win straight out but in reality this basically never happens. Being popular before any of these first elections even happen indicates nothing other than media savvy and while that's important to winning it isn't everything.

Second, he doesn't have support where it counts. Doing well in straw polls is one thing, getting the support of the Republican political machinery is another and Trump doesn't have that support yet. Popular support can sway the machine but it needs to be unanimous and overwhelming. The Republican machine will never back Trump because he can't win in the general election. He's too polarizing and he alienates too much of the Republican base. Without that support he can try for a long shot as an independent (an independent candidate has never won the presidency) or he can keep going as a Republican which will earn him the undying hatred of the Republican machine and many Republican voters; if he runs Republican without party backing then it's the equivalent of an ""all in"" bet, win or die.

Third, he has no real platform. He has some stock Republican viewpoints and some aggressive (if vague and unrealistic) ideas about immigration and ""jobs"" but beyond that all he's done is just stand there and yell that he's got a plan but we can't know what it is until he's elected. This generally doesn't fly with voters. Several candidates have tried that and it virtually never works. He has no real plan, he has rhetoric. He's banking heavily on his past achievements in business (""I'm rich so I can totes do the same thing with the US economy"") to be his cred but being a good businessman and being a good president are not the same things.

Fourth, candidates who burn brightly months before polls even open tend to burn out once our attention span runs out. If someone has a meteoric start and it's a year and change until people have to actually start voting then they usually fade out unless they can keep doing things to keep themselves interesting and Trump's act will get stale fast unless he starts taking positions and acting like someone who actually has a plan rather than a guy trying to win it on sheer balls. I'd give him till December or January before his ""tellin' it like it is"" attitude starts to get boring and he just fades from notice or he does something so over-the-top that he shoots his own foot and seals the deal on him being unelectable.

>Or is it just media hype/his wealth that's keeping him in the mix at present? 

It's entertainment, honestly. A 24 hour news cycle has to have something to hash about and Trump's comments make as good of fodder as anything.

Don't sweat. As much as I'm crossing my fingers for it the man has no chance.",0,0,1441801099,1444731352
