3nkgaa,What political issues are controversial amongst students?,58,kevinbaconjames,"I'm working on a short story about an election campaign for President of a university students union. I need a key campaign issue that can split the vote. My problem is that students tend to pretty much agree on all the key issues - more funding for student loans, expanded Pell grants, cheaper books, almost universally progressive on social issues like gay marriage and abortion.

What are some issues where there is a genuine split in support amongst students?
