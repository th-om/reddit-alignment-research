3lwfqf,Can we have a real discussion on abortion policy?,139,astrawnomore,"I know this is a touchy subject, and even here on reddit I am sure there will be a lot of downvoting on both sides. However, I feel my opinion lies somewhere in the middle on this issue, so I just wanted to start a discussion to help me get my thoughts together and maybe to get others to think about the other side as well.

The way abortion is discussed seems very partisan to say the least. It seems both sides are so emotional about it that it's hard to find the root of the problem. **The reason it's so hard to agree on abortion policy as a society is because there is no correct answer.** The distinction between living and nonliving is incredibly ambiguous, and abortion happens to be a particularly nasty confrontation of our lack of understanding of the deep-down how's and why's of life.

We can construct biological definitions of life and work from there, but those definitions are usually somewhat contrived and without rigor. Most of all, any biological definition of alive vs. dead that is made will almost certainly contain some element of philosophical bias. **At this point, the distinction between living and nonliving is philosophical, not scientific.**

Next, I will briefly describe my perception of the pro-life and pro-choice arguments. I may very well have an inaccurate understanding of one or both sides, in which case I am open to correction.

##The Pro-Life Argument
___

""Pro-Lifers"" typically believe that a human life begins at or shortly after the moment of conception, i.e. when the sperm fertilizes the egg. Since this zygote contains the genetic material of a unique person, it should be considered a person and therefore have the rights of any other person, including the right to life. In particular, as it develops into a more and more human-like form (into the first and second trimesters), it becomes increasingly immoral to destroy the fetus for non-emergent reasons such as risk to the fetus or mother.

To me, this argument makes some sense on an intuitive or emotional level, since you really can see the basic shape of a human during the second trimester. Currently, it is legal in the US to abort a fetus up to 24 weeks (6 months), at which point the fetus looks distinctly baby-like, has a heartbeat, moves around, has mostly developed parts, etc. It just *feels* wrong to kill something that is so similar to a newborn.

##The Pro-Choice Argument
___

""Pro-Choicers"" typically believe that a human life begins much later, at least halfway through the pregnancy. Each individual has his or her own opinion on when the fetus becomes a baby with some form of consciousness, and importantly, perception of pain in the case of abortion. However, between conception and this defined starting point of life, the zygote is no more a conscious being than our own skin cells, which we do not care about. If this is true, then it is silly to force a woman to have a child she is not prepared for when the only factor in the equation is her own body and a clump of deliberately replicating cells.

This argument makes sense as well on an intuitive level since it's obvious that at least during the first trimester, there is no humanoid consciousness there. It's just cells. There's no mind. So what's the big deal? How is it different from contraception?

##Your Input

___

Where do you draw the line? What qualifies as ""alive"" and why do you make this distinction? Do you think that disagreement on this particular idea is what drives a lot of the misunderstanding and animosity in the debate over abortion?

My opinion right now is that I would prefer if abortions were limited to a bit earlier date. 24 weeks seems rather late in the pregnancy, to the point where I feel uncomfortable with killing the fetus. I don't know enough biology to decide a better time when the fetus is sufficiently undeveloped, though.

I truly would like to hear some good arguments both ways. This has been on my mind a lot, so let's hear it.",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lwfqf/can_we_have_a_real_discussion_on_abortion_policy/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442897897,1444725479
