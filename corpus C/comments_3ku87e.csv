The issue is that monetary policy is very technical. You want experts making the decisions. You have to reconcile that impulse with very legitimate worries about an undemocratic institution with a lot of authority. We strike a very good balance in the status quo. All important policy makers at the fed are nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate. They are subject to multiple levels of audits from [government and private auditors](http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12784.htm). It is incredibly dishonest to call their power unchecked. They usually don't even directly expand credit. They can only influence factors that influence other factors and hopefully lead to credit. If their power was as massive as the OP claims, there would have been more inflation and more loans being extended.

One possible explanation for this could be that academia simply no longer teaches economic theory that contradicts the Federal Reserve system.

I have heard this theory advanced before, like [this article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/07/priceless-how-the-federal_n_278805.html) would be an example.

Academics don't want more Congressional oversight over the Fed because they understand that one of them is run soundly, is very transparent (you'd be surprised how much info the Fed releases), the Fed greatly tempered inflation and unemployment problems that existed pre-Volcker and is thoroughly examined through hundreds of thousands of hours of audits while the other government body trips over itself causing a partial shutdown.

Just to rip apart the article some more.

>Paul Krugman, in Sunday's New York Times magazine, did his own autopsy of economics, asking ""How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?"" Krugman concludes that ""[e]conomics, as a field, got in trouble because economists were seduced by the vision of a perfect, frictionless market system.""

Krugman manipulates ignorant people all the time which is why he gets paid handsomely. Economists by and large don't believe that all markets are perfectly competitive. Industrial Organization which is a hugely successful field in economics specializes in market failures. 

Want to know why Europe has faster and cheaper internet? It's because of the regulatory advice by IO economist Jean Tirole. 

>The Fed has been dominating the profession for about three decades.

Uh, no, not really. Fed economists have two main research goals: policy research and then freedom to research whatever the hell they want to. Policy research largely focuses on Monetary and Macroeconomics but there's an obvious increase in regulatory policy work. Other research is more scattered on topics including labor, education, finance, etc. The scattered topics don't have that big of an impact on the field. Monetary and Macro do or at least some authors do. But that's a small part of what economics is. And neither Monetary nor Macro has anything worthwhile to say on the crisis. 

It's the financial economists who had the most to say.

>Adding in statisticians, support staff and ""officers"" -- who are generally also economists -- the total number came to 730.

Yes, god forbid that economic policy setters understand economics and can rely on economists who specifically research that topic. 

>That's a lot of money for a relatively small number of economists. 

They're self-sufficient. They receive no operational funds from Congress so they'll pay what they think is fair to attract talent and get great consultants like Andrew Lo and Kenneth Rogoff. 

>Combining his numbers with the current ones from the AEA and NABE, it's fair to conclude that there are something like 1,000 to 1,500 monetary economists working across the country [...] Add in those who have previously worked for the Fed -- or who hope to one day soon -- and you've accounted for a very significant majority of the field.

The Fed is also a regulator. There are papers on regulatory policy, not just monetary policy.  

>Auerbach concludes that the ""problems associated with the Fed's employing or contracting with large numbers of economists"" arise ""when these economists testify as witnesses at legislative hearings or as experts at judicial proceedings, and when they publish their research and views on Fed policies, including in Fed publications.""

An economist being paid to research monetary policy is a problem? This man sounds like an idiot. 

Hell, the Fed even pays dissenters. Stephen Williamson thinks that QE has done jack shit and he does research on its effects. 

>""Try to publish an article critical of the Fed with an editor who works for the Fed,"" says Galbraith. And the journals, in turn, determine which economists get tenure and what ideas are considered respectable.

Does Gailbraith ever get published in reputable journals? You might have heard Galbraith's name during the Greek crisis. He was working with then finance minister on a way to return to the drachma. Which is illegal by Eurozone law.

No argument from me there. It seems silly to bring him up, he's more of a blogger nowadays.

>Fed economists have two main research goals: policy research and then freedom to research whatever the hell they want to. Policy research largely focuses on Monetary and Macroeconomics but there's an obvious increase in regulatory policy work.

That sounds like a good enough arrangement. It still does strike me as though there is somewhat of a conflict of interest if a significant amount of economists in certain subfields are on Fed payroll at any given moment. After all, people don't have an instinct to bite the hand that feeds them.  So maybe the article is overblowing it, but it must be true to an extent -- for example maybe economists would be jeopardizing their careers if they expressed views too far outside the mainstream. As time marches on, the window of acceptable beliefs could grow narrower and narrower. I mean, not a lot of mainstream economists question the fundamental economic beliefs that the Fed is based on.

>The Fed is also a regulator. There are also papers on regulatory policy, not just monetary policy.

Can you explain this one? What does the Fed have the power to regulate, and wouldn't these policies generally be interwoven with monetary policy anyway?

>An economist being paid to research monetary policy is a problem? This man sounds like an idiot.

>Hell, the Fed even pays dissenters. Stephen Williamson thinks that QE has done jack shit and he does research on its effects.

I think what the author was trying to say, is that economists are often weighing in on policy in many different venues. It is not always clear to those judging their words that they may have close ties to the Fed. In other words, they might have the appearance of independence from the Fed when speaking on issues close to the Fed, but in reality, they could have a conflict of interest.

It's notable that Williamson is a QE dissenter. But isn't he the single one on the FOMC?",1,0,1442198261,1444729310
cv0puze,0,t1_cv0pgb5,CompactedConscience,"I think it possible that this has a small effect. Some people could be pulling some punches because the fed is so well respected.

Could the fed be well respected because there isn't a lot of bad things to say about it?

However, I don't think that bias would result in the kind of consensus you see in the poll. Academic feuds do occur and can get heated. You can scroll through that website a little.

Well yeah, it's very hard to isolate cause and effect. Another explanation is that the Fed has been around for 100 years now and so pragmatically, the focus has shifted to taking the Fed as a given, and taking it for granted that the Fed is the best possible way of fulfilling the mandate that it was tasked with.

I'm just surprised that there isn't more skepticism or debate in the field over whether the Fed *is* the best way of fulfilling the mandate it was given. Because its track record isn't all that great, to be honest. It was created with the intent of not having financial panics (or at least being able to easily ameliorate them) and yet it seems like this has not happened.

One could point to a lot of the Fed's successes in adapting monetary policy to new challenging situations, but a detached observer might just point out that the Fed was engaged in solving problems that it created itself.

Admittedly I'm not so knowledgable in economics. So my skepticism of the Fed could be wholly attributable to ignorance, or it could arise from my lack of inculcation into mainstream academic economic thought. Based on common sense, though, I don't have a lot of faith that the Federal Reserve system is truly the best arrangement. I don't really know what would be better, but the Fed just seems like a precarious, corruptible, and unfair system. Especially after reading [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/business/economy/the-feds-policy-mechanics-retool-for-a-rise-in-interest-rates.html) it really just seems like we've reached uncharted waters.

cv0t3tz,0,t1_cv0sqak,CompactedConscience,"I argued with a guy down-thread who made a similar point. It just isn't borne out by evidence. There were more and worse recessions before the fed. I linked a few studies, admittedly fed commissioned but still full of good information and analysis, to that effect. I'm sure you could find them if you scrolled down on this page.

The main argument of the article you posted supports the point of the fed's supporters more than its detractors. The fed doesn't have a perfect ability to actually influence the variables it wants to influence. It can't simply turn a nob and perfectly influence policy variables. So it is fair to describe the Fed as ""precarious"" in a sense, but not in a bad sense. There aren't alternative systems that could do better.

Nothing you linked shows that the Fed is ""corruptible"" or ""unfair"". In fact, the fed operates completely parallel to issues of fairness or unfairness. Its policies have distributional consequences, but they probably tend to cancel out. At the very least, the distributional consequences aren't clear cut. And the fed is much more transparent than other similar government institutions. They are, again, subject to many layers of oversight. ",1,0,1442202583,1444729310

I didn't post that article because it represented my views perfectly, though there was some of it that I would agree with. Mainly I just wanted to bring it up because I thought it was interesting and partly relevant to polling economists.

If you expect me to link a source backing up every outlook of mine, that might get tedious. I'm just saying that as a layperson the Fed does appear corruptible and does appear to be working in the interests of the elites and not ordinary people. If I'm unqualified to put forth that assessment without 'proof' of some sort we might be at an impasse. It's more of a judgement rather than something provable. 

What the Fed is proposing to do next (quadruple the interest given on 2.6 T of excess reserve deposits, to a full 1%) just further reinforces these beliefs. More free money for the big banks. I mean, banks sure do get rich off of the Federal Reserve system, do they not? There's just so many places in the process where they can dip in their proboscis. 

The interests on excess reserve deposits (coinciding with a huge expansion of ERDs) is just the latest thing. Before that it was the gigantic, undisclosed below-market-rate Fed loans to banks. And then the banks are constantly making easy money from open market operations -- the primary dealers get middleman fees since the Treasury for some reason can't sell directly to the Fed. When you tie in the fact that the decisionmakers at the Fed and huge banks (e.g. Goldman) have a revolving door between them, this stuff starts to look mighty suspicious.",1,0,1442205625,1444729310

Before, they were telling us that expansionary monetary policy was helping the big banks by encouraging people to buy stocks. Now, contractionary monetary policy is helping the big banks because they can take advantage of higher interest rates. 

Well, monetary policy is always going to be either expansionary or contractionary. Even w/o a federal reserve this would be true. Interest rates will either be high or low. There are definitely distributional consequences, but they are nowhere near as simple as you make them out to be. It isn't at all clear that the net effect of raising rates will be to hell big banks.

My sense is that expansionist policy is good for banks, yes. Or, the recent spate of it certainly has been. For one, every time the Fed buys a Treasury security in QE, which has been a whole lot of times, a bank (primary dealer) makes a commission. Then, there is all the risk-free money earned from the expansion in excess reserves (and the attendant interest) as a result of these open market operations.

I'm also saying that the specific tools the Fed is contemplating for transitioning to contractionary policy seem to be specially tailored to benefit banks in this case. As I mentioned before, with 2.6 trillion in reserve deposits, the Fed is planning to raise the excess reserve deposit interest rate from 0.25% to 1.00%. This means 26+ billion dollars per year flowing from the US Treasury to the banks. It's pretty generous. This measure is in no way a fixture of contractionary policy, it's just what the Fed has decided to do in this instance (if that latest Binyamin Applebaum article is a trustworthy indicator of the Fed's direction).

Nitpicking, our interstates, schools, and healthcare system aren't exactly in great shape. The regulation that has been written probably isn't the socially optimal regulation, either. 

This is all besides the point. Fiscal policy and regulatory policy are far less inside-baseball than monetary policy. They are much easier to understand. The math is simpler.

cv1nxlx,0,t1_cv1n0qg,CompactedConscience,"When I said that people have never complained to me about inflation, and you acted surprised, did you think I had lived through the 70's (perhaps the only time inflation in the US has been ""high"")? The average person on Reddit did not. 

Maybe I am also confused because people also shouldn't care about expected inflation (the only kind that would stem from fed policy). There is lots of evidence that money is neutral. Inflation that falls short of hyper inflation doesn't decrease economic welfare. 

Lets take a step back because this is a giant tangent. The topic of this conversation is the feds stewardship of the economy, which has an extremely solid track record. ",1,0,1442269821,1444729310

Yes, unless you have personally experienced something, it means you shouldn't be concerned about it.

>There is lots of evidence that money is neutral. 

Dropping a trillion dollars from a helicopter has the same inflationary effects as printing a trillion dollars and burying it in a hole?

>The topic of this conversation is the feds stewardship of the economy, which has an extremely solid track record.

The Fed is currently in uncharted waters.  No one has any idea what a decade of ZIRP will do once a country is weaned off, of it it's even possible.  Look at the recent controversy over Yellen even considering raising it.  Central banks are not infallible nor omniscient.  Stop pretending like they are.",1,0,1442271006,1444729310
cv21g3w,0,t1_cv1om88,CompactedConscience,"I think it is pretty clear that this is the point in conversation that neither side is gong to be convinced with what the other has to say. 

I think that data and statistical analysis is a lot more convincing than comments like ""unless you have personally experienced something, it means you shouldn't be concerned about it"". I can't even begin to understand how someone would think otherwise. 

Your comment about helicopters and holes is nonsense. Current fed policy is like neither option. The fact that you think the situation is so simple proves that you don't know enough to talk about this issue. 

I have never once claimed central banks are infallible. They are simply much much better at making monetary policy than any alternative arrangement. I have cited a great deal of evidence to that effect throughout this thread. I have seen no evidence to the contrary. We might not know what ZIRP will do, but the predictions of people who thought it would be bad have been resoundingly wrong year after year. The predictions of people who were less concerned have fared far better.  ",1,0,1442292903,1444729310

The whole point of the Federal Reserve was to be a lender of last resorts when credit markets freeze up because of ""scares"" a recurring theme in US markets up to that point.

The question you ask is how do we feel about the Federal Reserves power, but this is not some new power. It's over 100 years old and compared to what happened before we made banks hold reserves and before we had the Fed to loan when markets freeze up, I don't see the power as out of hand, I see the entire banking system out of hand.",2,0,1442194436,1444729310
