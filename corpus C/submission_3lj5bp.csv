3lj5bp,I think the political divide in America is irrevocable. America should split into two countries of conservatives and liberal Americans. Do you agree?,13,MpMerv,"Speaking purely in regards to political opinions, I think liberals and conservatives are too different for presidential representation to ever be fair even in democratic elections. You look at the two leading candidates on the Republican and Democrat sides - Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are as different as night and day. Republicans fervently agree with Trump and Democrats equally so with Bernie. You listen to the issues each side wants and they are the polar opposites of one another. It has gotten to the point where I literally cannot understand why the other side thinks the way it does. I don't comprehend how someone can support Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. I don't get how their rhetoric doesn't register as crazy in their supporter's minds and I strongly suspect they think the same about the left.

Before a civil war breaks out, I honestly believe that we should consider splitting into two different countries where political opinions are more aligned. I mean, when it comes right down to it, I am simply not comfortable knowing people like Kim Davis, Ann Coulter, Pat Robertson and many others vote in the same elections I do for representation in government.
