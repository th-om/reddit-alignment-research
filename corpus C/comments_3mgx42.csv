She then went through her emails and purged the ones she deemed to be ""personal"" without any oversight or attempt to establish clear guidelines. 

Do you really not see any problems with any of this? Even if I were one of her supporters before this whole thing, I would be severely turned off by it. If Bush or Rubio or anyone else I'm supporting in 2016 were shown to have done this, I would find a new candidate.",5,0,1443290066,1444723472

That being said, I didn't know about Bush's alleged misuse of email and that  does concern me if true. However, I will point out a few key differences I see between that case and Clinton's:

1) Although Bush did occasionally use the account for potentially sensitive subjects, it's more understandable that he would not expect to need it for those things before he was in office. Clinton knew going into the Secretary of State job that most of her work would involve classified or sensitive materials and issues of national security concern. A state governor does not necessarily anticipate those things becoming significant parts of his work (especially before 9/11) and might not generally handle classified information.

2) 1998 (when Jeb took office) and 2009 (when Clinton did) were very different eras, technologically. Of course people had email in 1998 as well, but the rules surrounding records collection and preservation were not as well established and email itself was fairly new.

3) Jeb voluntarily released his emails in February of this year. He probably didn't release all of them, but if he had a screening process, it wasn't very good: plenty of those emails had constituents' personal information in them. While that's a problem in itself, it suggests to me that (unlike Clinton) Bush didn't have a team of lawyers sift through all of the emails to decide which ones would be politically advantageous to destroy.",-2,0,1443303819,1444723472
