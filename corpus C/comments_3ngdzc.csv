I don't think they believe they're silent anymore.  While not the majority, [conservatives are the plurality by a large number] (http://www.gallup.com/poll/123362/Independents-Lean-GOP-Party-Gap-Smallest-Since-05.aspx?CSTS=alert).

The left has convinced themselves, based on individual polling on single issues, that they're actually the majority, while ignoring why people vote and how important ideological identification is.

What it does is take Congressional votes and compare Congresspeople and Senators to each other, deciding from that whether we're more polarized, whether the parties are more conservative or liberal, and so on.

It's incredibly flawed from a political science standpoint.  If the parties agree a lot, it might show a lot of moderation even if one party is center and the other is center-left.  If a left wing party stays the same, and the right wing party elects more conservatives, it will show the right wing party being more extreme while ignoring that the left wing party may have already been extreme to start.  It also doesn't touch upon popular opinion or the ideology of the people who are not in Congress, thus providing a misguided assumption that those in Congress ideologically represent the general population when they really only represent their districts/states, and even then that's a limited claim (Massachusetts did not become a center-right state for a year and a half when Scott Brown was elected, for a recent example).

If we're trying to draw conclusions *in general* about the overall population?  Absolutely not.  It tells us nothing because it doesn't measure anything about the general population, only measuring what Congress is up to.
