3l4j0p,Does the real estate fraud connected to Bernie Sanders's wife bother you?,118,Risk_Neutral,"Pardon the sources, most things about this were reported on the local level only. 

Jane Sanders was the president of Burlington College, a small college in Vermont. In 2010, she planned an expansion. The real estate she had her eyes on for the school had a hefty price tag of $10 million dollars as compared to the school's revenue of $4 million. Obviously loans(tax exemption bond) of that size need some credit so the state wanted $2.3 million in guaranteed commitment. 

She said they had $2.6 million dollars in guaranteed commitments over the next 5 years which made the school eligible for the loan. However, one of the commitments was actually a bequest of $1 million dollars over the next five years, which cannot be used as a guarantee because none of the money had even been paid out yet. 

An audit of the university shows they had only $1.3 million in short and long term pledges for the year. That $1 million is actually accounted for here.

Fast forward 2 years to 2012 where she resigns and leaves with a golden parachute(severance package) of $200,000.

Fast forward to 2014 and the school is in $13 million dollars worth of debt and agrees to sell 25 of the 32 acres of real estate it purchased to help pay back the debt.

While I disagreed with Bernie, he always came off as genuine. He's been adamant about CEO's committing fraud, taking huge risks, only to leave with severance packages when they get fired. 


Here is a piece on her:
