3m52ix,Should filibuster rules be reset to what they once were.,47,slam7211,"I think it was during GWB's term that the senate changed filibuster rules so that you only needed to stand up and say ""I am filibustering this bill"" and then sit back down and the senate needed 60 votes to move forward. Prior to this you actually needed to keep the floor and never shut up. Should the rules be reverted?",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3m52ix/should_filibuster_rules_be_reset_to_what_they/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443056116,1444724814
