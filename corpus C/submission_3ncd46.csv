3ncd46,Could the president be doing more rhetorically to work on preventing mass shootings?,24,littlebitsoffluff,"I posted this earlier with a different title. I guess I used the wrong wording in the title, 'cause some moderator deleted the post. Which is somewhat irksome, because I spent a lot of time thinking through this matter and was looking for genuine discussion. If this gets deleted then I'll know it's the content that's being objected to, and I won't understand the basis for that. But we will cross that road if we get to it.

This is apropos of Obama's recent comments on the Oregon mass shooting.

I get that Obama's tried to enact elements of gun control during his administration and he's bitter at the failure, and I get that he's honestly and appropriately frustrated by this senseless violence. I understand that he feels Republicans have been obstructionists when it comes to passing new gun control laws that he believes would help reduce gun violence. I'm willing to concede all that, looking at it from his point of view.

That said, his tone during his most recent public appearance struck me as truculent. He's our leader. It's his job to find a way through tough problems and to show us light instead of dark, hope instead of pessimism. Instead of just popping on TV and telling us ""I told you so,"" If he really wanted to, he could say something like,

""The Republicans and I have obvious deep disagreements about the fundamental reasons why these mass shootings occur. And we hold fundamental disagreements about what to do about them. That much is obvious. All we need to do is look at the failure of the Manchin-Toomey bill, for one, as an example.
Nonetheless, as the leader of the country, I believe that this problem is too important, too divisive for the American people, too damaging for our national psyche, to stand by and do nothing. I will not give in, and I will not give up. I will find a solution even if it means negotiating with what I consider my arch antagonists--The Republicans, and the various interested parties, including the NRA.

As leader of this country, I promise to continue talking with the Republicans until we come to an agreement on what type of steps we might take to go forward to try to solve this problem. I have no idea what that solution looks like at this time, nor do I know if it will ever happen. But I promise I will keep inviting the Republicans to participate in the dialog until they accept.
Probably in the end, if we arrive at a solution at all, it will contain elements that I do not like, and it will contain elements that they do not like.

But I can at least guarantee all Americans that I will work on the problem, and I invite the Republicans to work with me.
As the first step, I am inviting representatives of the various gun rights groups, including the 2nd Amendment Foundation and the NRA, as well as members of the medical and psychiatric professions, members of law enforcement, and many others, to a summit here in Washington, where we can begin to lay down a map for the difficult road in front of us. Again, I have no idea, given our differences in the past, whether or not this attempt at discussion will be fruitful. But at least the American people can take some small comfort in the fact that their leaders and their knowledge experts are doing something, moving in the right direction at least incrementally. For although the task ahead of us may be daunting, difficult, and uncertain, if we continue to stand by idly and do nothing, then we surely fail.""

I think that everyone would take some comfort in hearing such words, no matter which side of the issue you may fall on.

Myself, I would consider such words encouraging and befitting of a leader. I did vote for Obama both times. I'm kinda looking for leadership from him on this matter.
