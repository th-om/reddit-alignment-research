Really? How did she make this bomb threat?  

The only evidence you provided was two articles that literally say that Eyman was suspended from school because another girl allegedly claimed she heard Eyman say she wanted to blow up the school. First of all thats hearsay and second of all a teenage girl in high school is one of the least credible source of information you can get. 

Personally this only proves to me that this school is either islamphobic or just sucks with dealing with different cultures/ethnicity. A normal school would not suspend someone for 3 days because of a bomb threat, thats expulsion in a zero tolerance school. I feel that they only suspended her because they knew that expelling or giving escalating the situation would force them to admit that the basis of their decision was on a teenage girls accusation with no evidence to back it up.

- Police knew it wasn't a bomb, so did the school.  There was no question about this whatsoever.

- There was no evidence that he told anyone it was a bomb or threatened anybody with it or was going to.

- The police saying he was 'being difficult' is the dumbest shit I've ever heard in my life.  Refusal to answer a policeman's questions isn't grounds for arrest barring actual probable cause, of which they had none.  Big mistake on their part.  

- The kid was never read his *Miranda* rights per reports, and the police refused to allow his parents to be present during questioning.  Big mistake.

- The school and district in question have [a documented history of idiocy regarding Islamophobia](http://www.slate.com/blogs/schooled/2015/09/16/ahmed_mohamed_s_school_it_was_afraid_of_islam_well_before_it_thought_a_clock.html), further calling into question their judgement.

The whole thing was a fuck-up on their part from start to finish.  Once they'd determined there was no bomb and that they had no evidence that he'd threatened anyone, they should have sent him home for the day with a stern talking-to about how shit like this could scare someone.  But no, they arrested him for no reason, allowed a sympathetic photo to be taken of him, and now they are all screwed.  His lawyers are going to have a field day with this, administrators are going to get fired and the PD is going to pay a settlement, because this entire case was a violation of his civil rights - which don't end at the door of a school building.
