California, as well as every other state has 2 senators and at least one congressman (many more in California's case) that can not only formally raise concerns to the legislative branch of the federal government, but can vote in and actually comprise the legislative branch of the federal government. Argentina does not.

No, the voters changed how that check is chosen from being appointed to being elected. No power of any senator was removed, but the senator is now more accountable to the will of the electorate.

The constitution was made with the ability to be amended so it would not have to be thrown out all the time, but could be adapted to fit the situation when needed. An amendment to the constitution has the same weight as the original words of the constitution and is in many ways the equivalent of a new constitution without all the trouble inherent in throwing out the old one. This flexibility is why it has lasted for so long.

I suppose I was unclear there. When I said legislative district I meant congressional districts in both the state and national level as well as state senate seats, but not national ones, can be and frequently are gerrymandered. I was saying that since a national senate seat follows state lines it cannot be gerrymandered and will be more representative of votes cast than a state appointed official would be, especially since with the exception of the governor all those legislatures who vote to confirm the senator are themselves possibly not representative of a fair election representing the constituents of their state. So an appointment is always less representative than a senator elected in the current system.

>They have no ties or formal channel or obligation to the state government.

But they do to the state's people, who both they and the state's government should be representative of. As I said earlier, and I believe this is our point of disagreement, a state doesn't have a will of it's own, a state is comprised of people and should represent those people. They are obligated to the voters.

>>No, the voters changed how that check is chosen from being appointed to being elected. No power of any senator was removed, but the senator is now more accountable to the will of the electorate.

>They removed a big check and duplicated one that was already in place. It was a stupid move and one that the founders should not and would not have allowed.

They removed a check the state government had on the federal government, but now the people of that state control that check. Since I have stated that the state government should have the same interests as the voters in that state I don't think it changes anything. The result should be identical unless the state doesn't correctly represent the people, in which case it should be superior.

Most of the founding fathers viewed the states as being a lot more sovereign than the people today, and considered the voters a lot more dangerous. Views have changed, and they knew they might, which is why they allowed amendments. 

And for future arguments remember that the founding fathers had diverse viewpoints and didn't agree unanimously on everything like some seem to imply when they assert that the founding fathers agree with them. Some and in this case most do, but certainly not all of them. And given how different the country is today it's debatable how much their views would change in a modern world.

An amendment is a change to the constitution. Unless you think the constitution should be unchangeable I don't see how you expect to prevent changes to it. And if it were unchangeable I doubt the country would have survived the aftermath of the civil war, where they prohibited slavery and gave rights via amendment.  Women would have the same voting rights as in Saudi Arabia. It would suck.

The senator still checks the power of the government when it works against his constituents, or he would lose the next vote. He still favors his state, just by serving his constituents. What exactly do you consider a state to be if not an entity comprised of the people living there? What different actions would be taken if the senator served the state as opposed to the people who make up the state?

This argument is spurious and I think you know that. The 17th amendment was passes pre-WW2. In fact it was almost immediately pre-WW1, but that's not as important. During WW2 spending skyrocketed and has never returned. The US stopped being isolationist and built a huge military, much of which remained afterwards and military investment has been huge ever since. We invested massively in science during the cold war with things like the Apollo program. We also spent massively on infrastructure like the Interstate highways, and performed plenty of anti communist ""police actions"" like Vietnam and Korea. Attributing all spending increases to a change in how senators is chosen is blatantly wrong, especially since revinue bills must originate in the house and all bills need the house to pass, not just the senate. Also the president unless there were enough votes to override his veto.

You never answered my question about how you would define the state as anything other than the group of people who live there. Who does the state government serve if not the state's people, and how is the senator serving the state's people contradictory towards serving the state government who should in theory if not practice serve the people who elected them? All representatives should ultimately serve the people whose interests they represent.

>Gerrymandering has nothing to do with it. Senators are not involved with districts at the state or federal level.

You ignored where I explained this. Senators in states before the 17th amendment were generally nominated by the state governor and ratified by the state legislature although the process did vary by state. That state legislature could be gerrymandered and therefore would always be at best equally representative of the people and in practice always less representative. Additionally the governor could have nominated a crony who the people never would have chosen, whereas an elected senator is always chosen by the people. 

>Clearly fucking not. Nothing has checked the ever increasing federal power since the passing of the 17th amendment.

The increasing power of the federal government started well before the 17th amendment and is not the result of the 17th amendment. It has been going on basically since the adoption of the constitution in the first place, which itself increased the power of the federal government over what it had in the articles of confederation. This slow process of the federal government was accelerated after the civil war, which crushed a lot of the concepts of state's rights by force. It also destroyed the idea of any state seceding and within a generation people began thinking of themselves as American as opposed to a citizen of a particular state and expanded the power of the federal government enormously. This is probably a definitive point at which the states really lost the power to check the federal government. Unless you think that was way back when Hamilton had the federal government assume the states' debts. Money is a good method of control and he explicitly said it would tie the states to the federal government, which wasn't wrong.

Whichever point you choose as the point of no return, by the time the 17th amendment passed most Americans considered themselves to be Americans, not Californians or New Yorkers. The states became less important as people moved more freely between them. The states lost well before senators were elected.

If the state governments were the ones blocking it, why did at least 3/4 of the states ratify the amendment? Why would he do the bailout 5 years before the amendment passed if it was created solely to pay him back? He would have wanted the guarantee of repayment before investing if he was rational and there is no way he could predict something as rare and hard to accomplish as an amendment would pay off, especially one that involved those who ratified it giving up power AND assuming an unwanted debt. How would the payoff for submitting to jp Morgan be the 16th amendment when that was something Morgan couldn't give, and in fact they gave to the government by ratifying it themselves, or at least 3/4 of them? This is conspiracy level logic. The states ratified giving up power. They didn't do it for the sole purpose of letting the government force them to give up more power unless they are completely stupid, in which case I would rather let the federal government have it.

But some are less corrupt than others, and in general the less corrupt systems are the ones where it is harder to bribe the ones who can give you a nice job in the senate.

A problem that would only get worse without the 17th amendment. Now senators need the approval of their party and the people instead of just their party. And let's be honest, that is what the state choosing senators would amount to, the governor choosing someone his party approves of and the legislature voting to confirm or deny along party lines.

>There is an inordinate amount of wealth in the senate. In 2011, 47% of US senators were millionaires. Your people's check on buying power is a failure.

Clearly the people don't have enough checks, but how would repealing the 17th amendment in any way improve this? The powerful have more means to gain more power. This is true in every system ever devised. But it was true even in the time of the founding fathers. The continental congress was made up entirely of the wealthy. 

>The evidence is plentiful. The national debt is nearly 20 trillion dollars. The US government borrows half of what it spends. Inflation is under reported and a brutal non-progressive financial rape of the poor.

That isn't evidence that the 17th amendment checked the federal government. Our debt has increased more or less since Andrew Jackson was president, and increased government spending can be seen in any first world country you care to look at. It's also largely a result of changes the US made after WWII, as I said before. 

The government borrowing more is a result of spending increasing faster than revinue. All revinue bills originate in the house and all spending and revinue bills must pass both houses and be signed by the president. Changing the senate didn't change the house or the presidency, and historically speaking the senate didn't suddenly agree or disagree with them any more before or after the 17th amendment.

None of this is evidence, all baseless assertions that can be proven to be unrelated.

>The people wanted the 17th largely because of the campaign highlighting the corruption in one state but printed in every newspaper everywhere. The bankers financed the newspapers. The people wanted but it should have cost them a new constitution to get it. That is my point.

There are multiple cases of senators gaining their position through corruption in multiple states.

Last time for this circle. The people have the power to replace the people that appoint the senators.

The people were lacking zero recourse before the 17th.

I do not believe the absence of wealth is good measure either. Wealth is a measure of competence and success and it should win some legitimate influence. With that said the state governments would stop any appointee that would limit or give away their own power. That is the key.

cv7dh1v,0,t1_cv7d90f,palsh7,"True, but I think the reason we're relatively peaceful and tolerant is because of our system of government. We haven't always been peaceful, as you know. And yet, even with a lot of people who have reason to not be peaceful, we have been able to remain pretty stable since the Civil War. Why is that? It's not because we're better than the Arabs. It's not because we're superior to the Africans. We're not. It's because our government allows for people to blow off steam and make their choices known. We could be better at being representative of the people, certainly. But it is our system, and our relative wealth and comfort, that makes it work. In a world government, the poor would theoretically be more comfortable and wouldn't have as much reason to rebel, and they would have representatives in government. Of course, the biggest downfall of a world government in my opinion is that the rich would almost certainly have to give up their riches in order for the poor to succeed--at least temporarily--and I don't think that would happen without a fight. But in the long run, theoretically, lifting up the poor of the world and educating them and enfranchising them would make for a *much* more comfortable life for the top 1%. I just don't know if we'd get that far before imploding. But if the world government were to be constructed in slow steps, it could probably be done right. You couldn't just create a world government out of nothing, though. Even if only out of ignorance, it would implode from rebellion and war. ",2,0,1442704704,1444726548
