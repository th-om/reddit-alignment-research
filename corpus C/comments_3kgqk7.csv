Obama encouraged more minorities than ever to vote, how do we know that there wouldn't have been a greater turnout with out these laws? The article you sourced says as much.

You are right this sample size is too small, but the facts show that [larger percentages of minorities do not have the needed documents](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-634) and it also can cost up to $58 to get the necessary document to get these IDs.

To me systemic racism is a combination of laws, often well meaning, that actively work against the progress of a group of people. Something like stop and frisk in conjunction with the war on drugs comes to mind right away. To me this is a case where the disproportionate application of the law does actually lead to systemic racism (though you are correct in saying disproportionate impact doesn't automatically make it systemic racism). The fact that minorities and white people use drugs at the same rate but black people are disproportionately jailed for possession, usually for weed, is a problem. The combination of the law, NYPD policy to stop minorities more, and the war on drugs creates a situation that unnecessarily gives minorities a criminal record that could greatly harm their chance of getting a professional career. To me this is not providing an equal opportunity to succeed. 

This isn't just a problem in NY, the DoJ found numerous cases of systemic racism in the Ferguson and Cleveland police forces also. 

>I believe one work around for a voter ID law was to provide free IDs for voting. I think that is a great way to address concerns.

The problem lies in the documents that are needed to receive the voter IDs. It is things like birth certificates and SS cards that many poor minorities do not have and are unable to afford. If there is a rebate that would make these documents free or at least cheaper that went along with voter IDs I would have less of a problem.

>Often you will see the claim limited to ""In Person Voting"" because no one is looking at mail in or absentee ballots. Just as your one article claims.

In person voting fraud is the only thing that voter IDs prevent and it's not a significant source of fraud. In addition these laws disenfranchise voters regardless of how well meaning they are. I would be all for a law that helped with absentee voter fraud but nothing has been proposed.

The problem with the purges is places like Florida implemented these purges too close to elections. I understand why these purges disproportionally effect Dem voters. Minorities and young people, Dem voters by and large, move more often so they would be more likely to be on the purge list.

The reason I don't think it is a problem is because of other outside influences related to cultural behavior (culture that is usually politically defended).  For example, certain groups tend to partake in drug use in public rather than in the privacy of their own home, where they are protected by law.  Laws are *supposed* to impact people's behaviors.  But culturally, some people in minority communities are taught to resist that change and they find themselves getting disproportionately caught up in the justice system because of it.

High population density urban areas tend to have higher crime rates... and lower rent and fewer restrictions on who they rent to... and [redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) still happens.

For that matter, so does selective enforcement. You're just as likely to find illicit substances on high-powered lawyers as you are to find them on low-income, inner-city individuals. (Hell, more likely... drugs cost money and low-income people, by definition, don't have much money.) But the high-powered lawyers have the money to sue your ass and the connections to get you in hot water with your boss's boss, so if you're a cop, who are you going to target when you're assigned to make drug busts by your boss?

Nobody wants to live in a crime-filled neighborhood. But worse than living in a crime-filled neighborhood is living in a [high-enforcement neighborhood where the cops \(out-of-towners to the last\) treat the citizens as piggybanks, to the extent where there's nearly as many arrest warrants (most for non-violent crimes) as there are people.](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/16/1371220/-Ferguson-an-Apartheid-Police-State-21-000-residents-w-a-staggering-16-000-open-arrest-warrants)

> Can black people not survive on their own merit? Affirmative Action policies are meant to help black people have it easier, why do they need things to be easier than everyone else? Why is the way to prevent judging people by their race to enact policy that seeks to judge people by their race?

Think of it this way: In the event of a tie, or even in the event of a muddy enough comparison that the person making the decision would treat it as a tie, the person doing admissions/hiring/whatever is going to have a bias. That bias is going to be toward what they think a successful person in that position looks like, and if they're in a mentorship role, probably toward the person who reminds them most of themselves too.

Most of the people in those decision-making roles, today, are white men. And the ones who aren't are still fighting the bias of expectations, having seen decades where white men are the default for those positions.

Affirmative action isn't about letting minorities into places where they can't survive on their own merit. It's about fighting the biases that keep them out, the ones where they're automatically losing in a tie despite their merits.

(Of course, that's not the entire story—there's attempts at correcting disparity-of-access as well, but that's a longer discussion. All else being equal, who's going to be a better swimmer—someone who had access to their own private olympic swimming pool at home, or someone who could go to the community center and get 30-45 minutes of lap time in once every two hours? Who's going to do better on admissions tests, the person whose parents could afford to send them to private school and buy them the prep courses and hire the admissions coach who specializes in getting people admitted to that university, or the person whose parents were both working full-time at low-paying jobs just to keep the rent paid and the fridge full and couldn't take as close an interest in their education even if they wanted to?)

cuxgkf0,0,t1_cuxbjq6,AMatterofTrust,"> They are meant to correct institutional and historical injustices

Whenever a republican presents a plan to eliminate affirmative action he/she always provides a mechanism to make college more fair for all. In that students are not discriminated against for their race, the race of the student will not be taken into consideration, implicitly and explicitly by design of the law. See: One Florida, Bush's achievement. It may not be perfect, but it provides a fairer system than affirmative action. 

Also, there is not a lot of evidence to support the claim that it really does correct historical injustices. If a lower skilled African American and an average white (similar incomes) were compared, the black can and often does get the position over the white. This is especially bad with Asians, who work hard to be smart, and it is not indicative of any ""privilege;"" Asians have a long history of  discrimination against them as well. 

And often it does not work. If you compare the percentage of African Americans taken in to the school, it is higher under affirmative action programs. **But** if you compare the graduation rate with some sort of degree, or graduation with honors, a different story is told. Many Blacks do graduate with honors or with some sort of degree. But often the ones let in under AA programs drop out, essentially setting them up for failure. A good book going into this in more detail is [this](http://www.amazon.com/Mismatch-Affirmative-Students-Intended-Universities/dp/0465029965). 

Also note. If black people are less educated than whites (which affirmative action admits and is why less skilled blacks get in over more skilled Asians or whites) because of factors from 30 years ago, that is understandable. But it is shown how college does little to correct this. You pick the college that matches your education level. Going to a college with higher standards won't make you smarter, it makes you more likely to fail. The time to fix all this is in high schools and elementary schools, a preposition that most conservatives would agree with and most conservatives try to fix. 

Also, this is not really related to affirmative action, but both Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, who collectively have a 66% change of winning the primary (Trump, although the current frontrunner, does not have high chances), both support a path to citizenship. ",0,0,1441936391,1444730338
