> Completely factual right-leaning source lauds videos for being 'largely unedited except to remove bathroom breaks"".

How are these not contradictions?  The liberal source was referring to the widely-disseminated CMP you tube videos.  The right-bias reporting was referring to the 'raw footage'.

Basically, OP's comment that

is wrong, *every source* has a bias, and the first thing you need to do when reading an article is attempt to identify

* the audience

* the source

* the purpose  (""To inform about..."", ""To persuade..."", ""To bring to anger/ emotional response..."", ""To agree with..."")

Looking at those three properties of any piece can really help you pick apart what might be over-emphasized and what might be glossed over (where the half-truths lie).
