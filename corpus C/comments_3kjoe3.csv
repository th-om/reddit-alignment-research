The press is playing up those states where Sanders is even remotely competitive, because they want a horse race. However, Sanders' numbers in most states are abysmal, and his numbers among all demographics *other* than very liberal whites is similarly so. His existence at this point is purely for appearances' sake - to make it at least *seem* like Hillary wasn't simply gifted the Democratic nomination.

Once Hillary becomes the Democratic nominee, the media will actually start paying more attention to her speeches and positions, and her numbers will recover. The only thing likely to change this is if:

1. Some particularly shocking *new* tidbit comes out of the E-mail Server thing, which at this point doesn't appear likely - she's apologized, everything investigations have uncovered has been fairly benign, and there simply doesn't seem to be any ""meat"" left to this issue. By the time primaries are over, continued mentions of this will likely be as much beating a dead horse as mentions of Benghazi and Whitewater.

2. Some completely new scandal comes to light. This, again, seems unlikely - Republicans must be scraping the bottom of the barrel if they're pointing fingers at her for doing something many of their own candidates for president have also done.

3. Something new and Earth-shattering changes the political landscape. You can never truly account for this possibility. In 2006, no one knew that the economy would be the absolutely, unquestionable, number one issue in the next presidential election. But the world moves on, and we all must move with it. McCain might have lost that election even if the economy remained healthy, but the fact that it failed during a Republican president's watch, and McCain's seemingly inept response to it (""the fundamentals of our economy are strong"", Nero sang as he fiddled) more or less sealed the deal on that election. Who knows what new event might seal the deal on any other election.

By the time the primaries roll around, the GOP field is essentially narrowed to 3 serious contenders, Rubio (establishment candidate), Cruz (Tea Party/evangelical candidate), and Trump (Trump candidate). These three will each win several states, and the primary season will remain competitive through to the convention (think Hillary v Obama in 2008, which was quite close). The convention possibly goes to a brokered convention (or some sort of deal takes place), and Trump and Cruz end up allying their delegates for the nomination (Trump for Prez, Cruz for VP is my guess, but it could be vice versa).

Biden doesn't run, Sanders puts up a good fight and wins a decent number of delegates, but ultimately can't touch Hillary (think Ron Paul vs Mitt Romney 2012). She wins the nomination.

Furthermore the fact that she's seen as part of ""the establishment"" doesn't help her cause. 

She would get absolutely destroyed at a debate unless the Republican debater is psychotic and/or brain-dead (which is always possible)...or unless the moderator was slipped a little money. 

Everyone is talking about the Republican party being unstable, but frankly I see the Democrat party just as unstable and unsure as the Republicans are.

First you would need a charge...a crime would have to be committed...and no one on the right...although I have found this to be a common theme....has a clue what that would be.

What you are seeing is whitewater II. A fishing expedition by the GOP in the house...they are calling it a Benghazi committee although the subject of Benghazi never comes up..E-Mails is all they can say...what that means nobody is quite sure but...keep digging.
