3m3i9k,"Let's say we (Mexico) builds the wall, now what?",12,MrFidel,"How will that affect the crime rate in America? Now that the industries that used to employ undocumented persons have to hire U.S. citizens will they be made (by more vocal employees) to improve workplace environments? How much will salaries for these positions go up? Will we import more produce or will supermarkets increase the prices?




What will happen to all these people that do cross illegally? Does Mexico decide to take care of them? Will the ""200 billion"" dollar expense transfer over to their government? Will there be unrest in Mexico? 


If the wall will truly be as effective as they say it will, the concept of mass deportation of current illegals is absurd and will only hurt relations with Mexico and the current Mexicans within the U.S.. Grandfathering this generation of illegals into the system is a much more pragmatic approach.




The supply for drugs will be affected, but the demand will stay the same. Will people end up using drugs less or will drug manufacturing in the U.S. become a big thing? The drug trade is hugely profitable to Mexico and other South American nations, there are literally gang wars over it, how will this affect those black market industries?



There are so many questions around this issue.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3m3i9k/lets_say_we_mexico_builds_the_wall_now_what/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443032704,1444724890
