However, when the inspections came back telling them there was something fishy going on at the clinic, they ignored the reports because they didn't fit their political ideology.",7,0,1441995047,1444730374
cuy7tx1,0,t1_cuy632k,beetbear,Since you clearly didn't look at the video I linked to here's another couple takes - [one from the left](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/04/201341411431138373.html) and [one from the right](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/04/why-dr-kermit-gosnells-trial-should-be-a-front-page-story/274944/). Both editorialize too much but at least the one from the left runs as an editorial. Gosnell was a horror show who took advantage of those that couldn't get reputable care at the lowest rungs of the economic ladder. That's all. There's wasn't some grand left wing conspiracy to cover things up. The fact is government is broken because the Right has systematically starved it of funds. 1 clinic inspection every 10 years? That's what happens when you don't fund the department of health. ,-3,0,1441997677,1444730374

cuxi8lk,1,t3_3kgjql,michaelmalak,"From Mother Teresa's second-most famous speech, at the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC:

> Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the child. I am willing to accept any child who would be aborted and to give that child to a married couple who will love the child and be loved by the child.",3,0,1441939257,1444730374
cuyzmhf,1,t3_3kgjql,GEAUXUL,"Yes. We do a lot of volunteer work for one in my hometown. The center takes in low income women and provides housing and assistance until they have their baby and can stand up on their own two feet. They also operate a goodwill type store where people will donate used baby clothes and baby supplies for women in the community who can't afford these things.

I don't know what you find so disturbing about that, but whatever.",1,0,1442068248,1444730374

cuyb2pe,1,t3_3kgjql,Mrs_Frisby,"They say they do but if every abortion was turned into an adoption that would mean over 1,000,000 babies a year.

If every abortion since Roe had been an adoption instead that would be over 60 million babies.

There are only 340 million people in the US.  If every single person were an employed adult in a stable marriage thats 170 million couples.  You'd still need 1 in 3 of them to adopt to house that many kids.

Also, most pro-life ""crisis pregnancy centers"" offer no medical care at all and lie outrageously to anyone who comes, then occasionally try to sell the babies for profit.

Sting operations on CPC's involving non-pregnant women who go to them for ""counciling"" are hilarious btw:

* [This woman was told by a cpc that her IUD was a baby that loved her very  much](http://jezebel.com/crisis-pregnancy-center-worker-told-a-woman-her-iud-was-1691665150).

A friend of mine had a similar experience only they thought her spleen was a baby that loved her very much.  The people working at them dress like doctors but have no medical training and so they can't read the sonograms they take.  They just point to a random blob and tell you that its a mid-to-late-term baby that loves you very much and you'll go to hell if you abort it.
