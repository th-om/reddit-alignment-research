[liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism) isn't the same as ""liberal"" (leftist).

Classical liberalism is a pretty far right economic philosophy by today's standards.

The American Revolution was a pretty conservative one.

Good try, though!",17,0,1442076979,1444729795

""Liberal"" in the 1700s sense described a platform that was libertarian or even paleoconservative in nature.

""Liberal"" in 2015 connotes statism and leftism.

These are all good ideas. We used to not have them, so we had liberalism to progress us to getting them.

It's wonderful to have progress, but when you've got from bad to good, isn't it then the time to stop progress and hold on to the good?",3,0,1442085547,1444729795
