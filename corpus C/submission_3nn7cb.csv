3nn7cb,What's preventing the individual states from implementing socialized healthcare?,114,shieldmegoodies,"Those who fall on the left side of the political spectrum in America tend to support universal or socialized healthcare, but most arguments imply that this should be implemented at the federal level. Given that over half of the country doesn't support socialized healthcare, and the constitution doesn't require the federal government to provide it, why aren't left-wing advocates focusing more on implementing this plan in their home state? It seems this would have more support in the left-leaning states in America, and as a bonus the more conservative states won't be forced to pay into a program that they don't approve of. 

So, what specific obstacles are preventing this from happening? Massachusetts had something similar with their universal health coverage, and Vermont had plans to socialize their healthcare system before eventually voting it down, but why haven't any of the liberal states followed through with implementing an actual socialized healthcare system that resembles those in the much smaller countries of Western Europe?",46,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nn7cb/whats_preventing_the_individual_states_from/,PoliticalDiscussion,1444091071,1444716536
