cvkjuiy,0,t1_cvkglmd,Vayate,"As it relates to the email scandal: Obama and Hillary don't have the best relationship, since Hillary is to the right of Obama and more of an establishment politician. Back when the D primary campaigns started, Obama wanted to draft someone more similar to him as a successor, hence he went for Senator Warren. He also needed to damage Hillary to make another insurgent candidate successful, so (according to rumors on capitol hill) Valerie Jarrett cooked leaked the information about this improper use of an email server to the press. Whether that's true or not, normally the DOJ wouldn't cooperate in the investigation, but for some reason they're suddenly issuing subpoenas and knocking on doors and doing forensics on mail servers -- all things they refused to do during the IRS targeting scandal.

Obama's in a bit of a bind though. His efforts to install a Mini-Me in the oval office haven't panned out. Maybe he's betting on Bernie Sanders, or maybe he's just in too deep and can't stop the investigation now. Maybe he'd rather sink the D ship for four years than hand the party back over to the Clintons. The last bit seems particularly likely.

Anyway, here's another example, of off the top of my head. After the George Zimmerman case, Eric Holder was pretty livid that there was no conviction. DOJ started looking for anything they could prosecute Zimmerman for, including civil rights violations. Zimmerman isn't a hero -- the guy's a manchild and domestic abuser -- but the guy didn't do anything especially egregious that would warrant that level of scrutiny from the attorney general himself. In spite of that, Eric Holder was leading the liberal rage machine's response to the acquittal, denouncing stand your ground laws and declaring that justice will be served.

The best evidence is found in the ATF's gun policies over the past couple years, though that's maybe a little wonky for Reddit. Things like banning steel core 5.45x39 because someone made a pistol for a movie prop that fires 5.45x39 blanks is a fantastic example of DOJ partisan hackery. 

So yeah, it's out there. Obviously you're not going to find any smoking guns -- there's never a smoking gun in cases like these, just a lot of circumstantial evidence.

If you don't know that Hilary Clinton has been caught lying about virtually every detail of this mess, you are willfully ignorant. 

The FBI has come out with over 400 classified emails, born classified, meaning the second they were generated they were classified. 

This is completely counter to the claim she made that they were later classified. An outright lie. 

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/hillary-clinton-email-state-department-release-214246

On top of that it was released today that Russia was targeting her.

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34411472

She claims she handed over the server when asked. That is a complete lie. She was asked something like 10 months prior. She refused until the FBI was about to knock on the door with a subpoena then handed it over. Then she lied about the reason and claimed it was a routine-sound­ing re­cords re­quest.  When clearly the FBI said it wasn't. 

Here are more outright lies.

Just look at the lengths they're going to and the depths their sinking to try and stop her: exploiting terror victims like goddamn ghouls.

If you can't even bring yourself to do that, you're just gonna get drowned in attacks. I wish presidential politics was more about integrity and issues. That's a world in which Bernie wins easily. But sadly all the data points to it being more about volume and managing perceptions, and that means doing things Bernie just isn't willing to do.

You don't have a problem with Congress using their powers to go after political enemies?  Let's be honest, the investigation of what happened in Benghazi! is done.  There's nothing else left to be revealed about that date and the committee doesn't even discuss it anymore.  It's all about tarring Clinton and that's it.

I don't think anyone buys the idea that this was ever anything other than a witch-hunt, specifically cooked up to attack Clinton. Here's how they operate:

• Ignore findings they don't like (such as the several investigations that have cleared the State Dept. and Clinton specifically) 

• Invent crazy conspiracy theories to pin on the admin

• Interview witnesses in secret and refuse to release testimony that doesn't jibe with their preferred narrative 

• Leak anything that does match their narrative to the press, out of context

• Slow-walk the 'investigation' so it drags out into election season

• Widen the scope to become a specific and targeted attack on Clinton

• Send their members on Fox News to talk about how shameful this all is, despite the fact that all previous admins and the ENTIRE Bush WH did the same thing

• Pretend that there's an eventual prosecution coming, even though everyone in this country knows there isn't one

As a liberal, 
I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic's resident libertarian; Connor Friesdorf.  But no one has  cut through the bullshit better than him with this ""fantasy about Clinton coming clean"":
 
>It’s fun to imagine her saying it:

>“America, let me come clean: Yes, there were classified documents on my email server. But let’s not be naive about this. In Washington, the fact that something is classified doesn’t mean anything"".

>“We classify everything!”

>“It’s a way of covering our asses, leveraging control of information to make ourselves more powerful, and feeling special. Sure, there are some secrets that really need to be kept. And we’re careful with that stuff. But when it comes to classified material, following the letter of the law would be a huge pain in the ass. And it would make government even less efficient than it is. Our IT isn’t good enough to protect most stuff anyway"".


>“So get off my back about these classified documents that were on my server. If you start enforcing these laws strictly...you’ll wind up with a Constitutional crisis, because virtually everyone violates them and is vulnerable. 

>**It’ll be like some Third World country where political opponents maneuver one another into jail on trumped up charges so that they can grab power**.”
