* George W. Bush really screwed up between deficit spending and the Iraq War. I haven't forgotten. I'm not convinced that most Republican candidates (save Rand Paul) have learned from W's mistakes. Jeb still has the Bush name.

* Many people, myself included, won't vote for another Bush. Period. Nothing he says will change that.
