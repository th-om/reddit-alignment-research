3kw7k4,Why is Government in the middle of marriages.,46,Urban_Blabbermouth,"Given the Kentucky Clerk problem, I was wondering why the government is in the middle of giving permission to people to marry?

 In the American colonies, marriages were required to be registered, but that was about it. Then came a combination of Jim Crow and the Eugenics movement and wise bureaucrats decided they needed to direct the decisions of their benighted citizenry.

    By the 1920s, 38 states prohibited whites from marrying blacks, “mulattos,” Japanese, Chinese, Indians, “Mongolians,” “Malays’” or Filipinos. Twelve states would not issue a marriage license if one partner was a drunk, an addict or a “mental defect.”
