3ju2b7,How could the response to the refugee crisis be improved if there was a well organised and equitable co-operation between all signatories of the refugee convention? (x-post /r/internationalpolitics),12,AbstractSpaces,"Cross posting because no seems to comment on /r/internationalpolitics. My point of reference with the regards to refugees is as an Australian (who is horrified at the conditions asylum seekers in our care are subjected to) who has also seen a lot of controversy over the crisis emerging in Europe. I want to avoid any discussion of whether this or that country should accept refugees and just operate on the assumption that if you signed the convention, you want the best for all refugees provided the influx doesn't destabilise your country.

As far as I can tell the current problems in how things are being handled are as follows:

Inhumane conditions while asylum applications are processed.  
The intake burden is not equitable between signatories.  
Refugees trying to settle in a place of their own choosing instead of the first safe country they arrive in.  
Dangerous journeys both out of their home country and to their desired destination country.

I don't see much evidence of an international effort to deal with the crisis, so I'm wondering if such an effort could make things better. I've outlined an example policy below (However I don't claim to have the solution):

What if all refugees were placed in a common pool regardless of where they applied for asylum, processed in internationally funded centres under humane conditions, then resettled according to a defined set of rules and equitably distributed between signatories according to how many refugees they can accommodate (based on GDP per capita for example)?

But even if an ideal solution were proposed I'm sure individual countries would fuck it up by putting their own interests first. So what do you guys and gals think of all this? What could be done to make things better, and how likely is it they will get better?
