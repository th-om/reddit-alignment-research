3ksf1t,Why is Bernie Sanders struggling so hard to gain African American support when he has such a long and consistent record of fighting for civil rights and economic equality for people of every race?,532,just-casual,"I'm a 23 year old white guy, so I don't claim to understand the African American perspective, but from everything I can see it simply is counterintuitive to bash someone who has literally spent a majority of his life fighting for you, even when you had no idea who he was. It just doesn't make sense to me. Anyone care to help explain?
