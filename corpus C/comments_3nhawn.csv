The problem with ""gun control"" is that there isn't a level-headed conversation happening.  The only time the issue gets brought up is after a shooting.  So the Democrats are trying to score points with the hysteria and the right, to me, appears to want to maintain the rights of the people.  Now, you're going to get angry at that, but think about it like this: the right seems to think about gun laws as the left does about voter ID laws.  If it's too onerous to ask someone to go to a place to get a free ID to prove who you are to exercise your constitutional rights, why does a gun owner need to do that plus a ton of extra shit?  Crazies are going to crazy no matter what.  Murder isn't legal and never was.  Any time a gun is raised to another human a crime is committed.  This has always been the case.  However, it's pretty convenient the Democrats want to forget about the underlying issues like mental health, poverty, and drugs which breed a metric fuck  ton of the gun violence in this country when it scores them ""points"" against the GOP.  The ""gun control"" that the Democrats seem to point to is places with outright bans which, face it, is never going to happen in the US.  Just as the GOP needs to accept that Roe v. Wade isn't going anywhere, the Democrats need to accept the 2nd Amendment isn't either.
