2. How much would you pay for a glass of water today? what about if you were dying of thirst? When you're close to the edge you take the first deal offered even if it is not the best. mostly due to marginal utility being weird for necessity when they are near to survival levels.

Fair point.  People relying on minimum wage for survival are put under a lot of pressure.  Unfortunately for this point, about half of minimum wage earners are under 24 -- meaning a lot of them are dependents (teenagers/ college students) and are earning 'spending money'.  About 2/3 minimum wage workers are part-time workers, which raises another question: Should a person be able to live comfortably from part time work?  Altogether, less than 5% of workers even earn minimum wage.

Again, fair point, but mitigated by the fact that *very few* people are in this position.

This is a bit off the mark, I think.  It's not one person negotiating with one business (or vice-versa) -- it's every person and every job trying to find the optimal combination of persons to jobs.  A job is negotiating with every person interested in the job, a person is negotiating with every business that has a job they're interested in.

I'm confused, is this an argument for, against, or neutral?  If people were not aware their labor has a minimum profitable price, then they'd be asking for more than they're worth, which would lead to a counteroffer near the maximum (not necessitating minimum wage)?  I think I'm misunderstanding your point though.

Yes, most people that earn min wage or less have a lower-than-average lifestyle or are dependents.

So I think my main counter to your points is: very few people depend on minimum wage to satisfy a minimum comfortable lifestyle -- those that earn minimum wage are typically young dependents.

Because employers want to spend as little as possible in labor costs and in jobs around the minimum wage mark is where they can cheap out as much as the market will allow.

It's focused a lot in the lower skilled jobs because, as long as the labor pool is there, paying someone $10/hr doesn't get me much more work done than paying $5/hr. If I'm hiring people then I have an incentive to shoot for the lowest wage possible because the work I need done is unskilled or semiskilled so I don't need to pay for quality, I need to pay for warm bodies. 

This works very well when the supply of labor is large and I can get people to work for next to nothing because they're just happy to have a job. IDGAF if it meets their needs or not, my need for labor is met at a low price so I'm happy.

>and if it does work then why would we need a minimum wage?

Because without it you have a ""race to the bottom"" scenario that we've seen historically in the US and we currently see anywhere else there is no or very lax minimum wage laws. Employers want to make money and they do that by raising revenue or cutting cost and one of the biggest costs for most employers is wages so if they can cut the cost of wages by lowering them but still get the same amount of work out of the employee they'd be crazy from a business standpoint not to lower them.

Even if someone decides to grow a conscience and not pay starvation wages, there are plenty of other people who won't hesitate and crowd the people paying good wages out of the market.

The short answer is that we don't know. Most of the empirical papers that try and find the effect of minimum wage on employment find that small increases in the minimum wage don't lead to increased unemployment. Many different theoretical mechanisms about why that might be have been proposed. However, to my knowledge, none of those mechanisms are consistent with evidence. That could mean one of two things. Either the measured effects on employment are wrong and our studies are being biased by something, or we just don't have the right theory yet.

If you can read through that and not see the repeated notes along the lines of ""this act was effectively unenforceable"", you must have some seriously selective reading. If child labor is what it's going to take for a family to survive, there's going to be child labor. Once families are rich enough that they can secure the means to survive without sending their children to work, they send them to school. And not before, regardless of what the law tells them to do.

I'm not too big on labour econ unfortunately, so I can't help you out too much. However, generally, if an individual's skill are worth a certain amount it's entirely possible that said amount will fall short of what an optimal minimum wage would be. 

It's important to note, however, that some kind of standard of living is *not* the correct way to view the minimum wage; if you do indeed have a minimum wage, it should be set at the equilibrium point where the positive welfare effects of higher income meets the negative welfare effects of disemployment, to maximise the welfare effects. I'm probably making a hash of this though, so I'll tag /u/besttrousers and hope he turns up, since he has a much better grasp of labour econ than I do and will be able to explain the theories and processes behind it. 

Edit: I'll also stick HE3's comment here, since he does a better job of explaining it: 

>Reposting from a comment a couple of days ago.

>The optimal minimum wage is equilibrium point where the negative welfare effects of disemployment cross the positive welfare effects of increased income. It has nothing to do with the cost of living, the morals we place on wages or indeed anything that has anything to do with individual need.

>As the MW grows so does its disemployment effects, the higher wage floor reduces demand for labor at (and near) the floor. Without other effects this would result in any MW having a net negative welfare effect, lifetime earnings for the MW group would fall as it would become harder for them to find work even though that work pays more then they would achieve absent a floor.

>The most significant of the other effects which allows for moderate increases of the MW to not create disemployment effects is that raises in the MW reduce turnover and thus labor costs (AKA efficiency wage), for most MW employers these costs are significant (not just searching but HCD in general, even unskilled labor still requires training). A MW increase which doesn't cause net labor costs to increase (EG cost of additional wage < savings from reduced turnover) will not create disemployment effects. The recent Walmart national increase was this in action, retail has the highest turnover rate in history and even with unemployment still persisting in many areas of the country Walmart were unable to fill positions (people preferred to be unemployed then work MW at Walmart).

>Optimal MW is the point at which additional wage == savings from reduced turnover.

>Dube recently used median income (simple distributional analysis, the higher median income adjusted for regional prices the smaller the MW labor force is and thus the higher optimal wage) to calculate this on a metro & state basis, as a policy paper to get the conversation going its very useful but we could build a far more accurate model then simply a function of median income.

>Tl;DR: Any policy which seeks to set the MW based on anything other then the size of the low-income labor market is going to harm MW workers.

The key to raising wages is not to dictate a wage higher than the market wage creating higher levels of unemployment for the low-skilled and no-skilled worker but rather what can we do as a society that gives these individuals the opportunity to GET their entry level job thus can learn skills and become more valuable (which means higher wages).

Minimum wage actually harms the very people that the law is intended to help.",0,0,1441734810,1444731492

The market will definitely yield a wage in almost any circumstances, and by that metric you could say that it works.  But perhaps there is more to consider in this area than just arriving at a wage.

If there is an overly burdensome cost (financial or some other sort of cost) to society associated with having a certain portion of the population receive a low wage, some might describe that as the market not working, even though the market produced a wage.  

>all they are doing is deciding at what value is anybody below that value now determined to be ""unemployable"".

They may be doing that, but I don't think we can conclude that is *all* they are doing.  I'd suggest they are also forcing employers to use some of the wealth they generate to keep the standard/quality of US society at a higher level than it would be without the minimum wage if all else is equal. 

>what can we do as a society that gives these individuals the opportunity to GET their entry level job thus can learn skills and become more valuable (which means higher wages).

I'd be interested to hear more about this.  Are any politicians proposing any ideas aimed at addressing wage issues via such a route?  ",2,0,1441741609,1444731496
cuury55,0,t1_cuurllx,BitcoinPatriot,"I see the point you are trying to make but are confusing two completely separate points. You are trying to tie together a person's value to their employer and the cost of living in society. They are irrelevant.

If a person has a low value to an employer the solution is not to demand the employer pay them more. The solution is to initiate policies and programs that increase a person's skill set and knowledge so that they are WORTH more to an employer.

Here is my proposal. A little unorthodox BUT does not go against economic theory (btw I teach college economics). What we should do is eliminate minimum wage and have each person that is willing to work get a job that matches their skill set and paid the market wage. Then, for those who are ""head of households"" or ""single parents"" that do not have the skill set and knowledge to earn a ""livable wage"" then we as a society kicks in a ""premium"" (say $2 or $3 an hour) IF they attend a class one night a week that teaches them more skills like how to make copies, answer phones, data entry, etc. But a person MUST be working in order to get the additional assistance. This incentivizes a person to actually work which will gain them skills and knowledge and because there is no minimum wage then the employer that is willing to pay $7 or $7.50 an hour (but not a higher minimum wage) is willing to hire this worker. And we as a society help this low skilled worker ALSO gain additional skills. I assure you within a year this person that might have started at $7 an hour would be making $9 or $10 an hour in no time.",0,0,1441742121,1444731496

Thats a matter of opinion depending on your opinion regarding the role of government.  I appreciate your argument that they shouldn't be tied together, but I do think others would disagree with you.  

Personally, I do not think its unreasonable to require that employers play a role in maintaining a certain level of societal quality, since it is that quality society with which they operate in that allows them to be so successful in the first place.  In this regard, you could almost look at minimum wage as a tax.  

That said, minimum wage isn't my ideal method of approaching this problem, either.    

Regarding your idea, it sounds unique, interesting, and intriguing.  I appreciate that I've only read a paragraph on the topic, but at first glance it sounds expensive and it sounds like it removes the burden from employers to offer a living wage (weakening the already shitty employee bargaining power) and puts on the shoulders of tax payers (and I understand that employers are also tax payers).  

How is this not just the government subsidizing shitty wages from shitty companies who don't want to pay their shitty employees?  ",2,0,1441742834,1444731496
cuusu8h,0,t1_cuusf7j,BitcoinPatriot,"There is where you are wrong and the problem with our current society. It is not the responsibility of the employer in maintaining a certain level of societal quality. The responsibility of the employer is to hire a worker to be productive and pay them the value of their productivity. If a minimum wage is higher than the productivity of the worker then the worker simply doesn't have a job. The responsibility of the employer is to pay a worker their value. It is up to the worker to gain the knowledge and experience that INCREASES their value.

Ironically many believe that minimum wage is the ""solution"" but is actually the problem.

And you say ""it sounds like it removes the burden from the employers to offer a living wage"" and that is the problem. It is not the burden of the employers it is the burden of the employees.

And it shouldn't be the burden of the taxpayers either and should be the burden of the employees. However, as a taxpayer I don't mind helping those who truly need help IF they are willing to work hard to better themselves. In fact this might not HAVE to be a taxpayer funded program and wouldn't be surprised if a private organization was started to help the ""needy"" and initiate a PRIVATE program (funded by voluntary contributions) that does the same thing. I would definitely give to a program that TRULY wanted to help those in need BUT requires they have a job first. The problem with our current social programs is the waste and abuse and forced to pay higher taxes to pay for an inefficient program. But if it was a private program that required a person has a job BUT wanting to better themselves and willing to go to classes to learn more skills and gain more knowledge many people I know would gladly contribute to that.",0,0,1441743487,1444731496

In a free market, sure, but we gave that idea the middle finger pretty much from day one.  

There is no responsibility for an employer to make work environments safe, but we decided that way sucked and forced them to do it anyway.  There is no responsibility for them to comply with compatibility standards, but we decided that way sucked and forced them to do it anyway.  There are countless examples like this.  

Employers are responsible for doing whatever the laws of the land tell them they have to do.  

Perhaps you mean to say, employers *shouldn't* be responsible for any of this?

>It is not the burden of the employers it is the burden of the employees.

In at least some sense, it is the burden of the employers, because we have a minimum wage.  If the minimum wage was raised to a living wage, then it would 100%, very literally be the responsibility of the employer to to offer a living wage.

However, I also would much prefer that this responsibility be placed on the shoulders of employees.  Personally, I would like to see wage issues addressed through union reform, or perhaps union destruction and rebuilding.  Clearly the US sucks at unions, and other countries don't.  I think if we did better in the area of unions, we could deal with a lot of these problems a lot more effectively.  

>However, as a taxpayer I don't mind helping those who truly need help IF they are willing to work hard to better themselves. 

So how would you want to handle this?  Raise taxes equally across the board to pay for it?  Focus on certain kinds of taxes?  Just curious how you'd like to get the revenue for such an idea.

cuvogoq,0,t1_cuutjh6,BitcoinPatriot,"We are already paying taxes that are not being used efficiently. Simply changing the structure of the entitlement programs would solve this. Now there are too many that do not understand economics so the solution to this problem could never get approved and passed through Congress but the solution would be simple if the people, and politicians, really understood.

Simply remove the minimum wage and tell people that in order to get a ""head of household"" or ""single parent"" supplement they must show proof of a full-time position. Without minimum wage rules there would not be excessive unemployment because the markets would find jobs for everybody albeit some at a lower wage than the current minimum wage. But with the taxpayer supplement we can make sure those individuals who truly need assistance can get the assistance while we mandate they attend classes that improve their job skills and knowledge. This assistance would be temporary (shouldn't be more than a year) because by then they will have job skills, experience, and knowledge that makes them worth more and will be paid more.

And unions are the CAUSE of massive unemployment thus should not be incentivized at all. If a person wants to join a union that is their choice but every economics textbook in the country shows that in order for a union to force higher wages means there are less jobs. Yes a few make a little bit more but many others lose their jobs.",1,0,1441813295,1444731496
