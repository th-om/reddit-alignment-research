3li5ks,"Why is there so much outrage over private prisons, but UNICOR doesn't get anywhere near as much attention?",21,BoiseNTheHood,"[Background information on UNICOR:](http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/14/smallbusiness/federal-prison-business/)

> Unicor is a government-run enterprise that employs over 13,000 inmates -- at wages as low as 23 cents an hour -- to make goods for the Pentagon and other federal agencies.

> With some exceptions, Unicor gets first dibs on federal contracts over private companies as long as its bid is comparable in price, quantity and delivery. In other words: If Unicor wants a contract, it gets it. 

Bernie Sanders recently [introduced a bill that would ban private prisons.](http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2015/09/17/bernie-sanders-seeks-to-ban-private-prisons/)  In his own words, his motivation for the bill was that ""making sure that corporations are not profiteering from the incarceration of fellow Americans is an important step forward."" 

However, private prisons only represent about 8% of our prison population.  The government is still in charge of the vast majority of our prison system, and they regularly engage in the same behavior that the left criticizes private prisons for.  Even worse, UNICOR is anti-competitive and hurts small businesses. As far as I can tell, Bernie hasn't commented on this program.  Why does this go unnoticed and uncriticized?",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3li5ks/why_is_there_so_much_outrage_over_private_prisons/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442624522,1444726870
