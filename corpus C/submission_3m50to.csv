We worship growth like it's important.

But we tend to ignore those forces who contribute negatively to growth, instead choosing to take resources, and make others pay for the rights to rent and use those resources to help other growth occur.

Why?  I know why is a hard question, that requires people to expand outside the context of the current situation.  But this topic, to me, is the fundamental nugget holding back progress.  Said more bluntly, why do people accept psychopathic cunts, the ""owners""  running the world so poorly?

As I see it, there are three basic classes of humans:

1) Those who have basically nothing, and either work for others or get help from others.  (workers)

2) Those with means of production and wealth, either physical capital, or mental or physical ability, or financial resources invested in the wealth creation of others. (investors)

3) Those with so much wealth they make others pay them for the rights to access or use their systems, without creating any wealth themselves. (owners)

Classes 1 and 2 basically contribute to growth, but the class 3 people: those who sit on housing and buildings and make others pay them for eh ability to use them, essentially over-capturing the past paid-off risks are taking from everyone else.  As inequity gets larger, the leverage those in class 3 have over everyone else in class 2 and the quickly growing class 1 continues to expand.

The recent flap about the drug company CEO is just one example of class 3 people sucking the life out of all of society, using (abusing) the established systems of finance and capital against everyone else.  Seems entirely obvious to me that the systems we've created are not working, at all, they are ridiculously ineffective and unjust, disempowering and ineffective for the vast, vast majority of the whole human population.  Tweaks and regulation do not fix it, it's a systemic wholly misdirected issue that the ""goal"" is to create people in class 3 that lord over everyone else.

There are several fixes I've been working on, including:

* different models of property for land use, that includes stewardship and social responsibility in addition to traditional property rights

* elimination of remote ownership in a variety of contexts, essentially eliminating absentee landlords and stock ownership

* Elimination of public debt, entirely - no governance without funds raised for purpose

* dramatically increased transparency of money, moving toward no private money

* death sentences for corporate entities no longer serving the needs of the population

* remarkable scale back and elimination of large national power in favor of local governance principles.  

* Elimination of laws as the primary means of governing, in favor of a mix of laws for forbidden behaviors and a set of norms and principles that are group enforced as part of society


I'm here on this planet now more than 5 decades, and so disgusted and withdrawn with the current situation.  We're literally killing ourselves and people don't give a flying fuck, at all.  People can't even see the overt, extreme hypocrisy of modern nations: consent is a joke, we're not represented, the world is literally falling apart because of all this shit.  Right now all around us.  No one seems they can see it, no one seems to be energized to make meaningful, actual change against the juggernaut of current cultural norms.

Unfortunately to enact the changes I see it means radically changing or bringing down the current social structures and norms that have served humanity for about 500 years.
