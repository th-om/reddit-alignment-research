3jv04o,I see the great Trump attacking Carson very soon.,19,justicelikelightning,"Carson is very soft spoken and sounds like a fucking pansy. ""Please do this for me"". He sounds like Bob Ross. I can't see him negotiating with Putin or Shinzo Abe. 

He does not exude strength like Trump. Trump can negotiate with these leaders. Trump can deal with ISIS. Trump says what needs to be said. Trump has spent years in the boardroom, Carson needs to operate on people who are asleep. 

PS, buy Art of the Deal. It's a great book. ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3jv04o/i_see_the_great_trump_attacking_carson_very_soon/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441551036,1444732168
