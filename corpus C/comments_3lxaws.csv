I would argue that the Medicaid expansion has been a net positive as well. It's just not hyped as much because a lot of states try to conceal that it's part of Obamacare. For example, here in Indiana, we launched ""HIP (Healthy Indiana Plan) 2.0,"" an expansion of the previous HIP program that covers more people. It's been heralded as a massive success, and especially after the backlash of the RFRA legislation, Mike Pence is trying to push it as a tangible success of his tenure as governor. However, it's literally only possible because of the funding form Obamacare - HIP 2.0 is Indiana's compliance with the Medicaid expansion, rolled into an existing state-level program.

>I ask again, What happend to the affordable part of the ACA? Obama promised it would lower rates for the average family, you can't change the goal posts now and make up shit that was never said.

I'm interested in knowing if the subsidies are taken into account here. Are we talking an increase in the rate of overall premiums, or an increase in the rate of out-of-pocket expenses? Likely both, but 15% rate hikes were pretty typical for several years in the insurance industry, and if the subsidies make it so that rates still increase 15% but the consumer pays a lesser percentage of that increase out of their own pocket, it is in fact saving the consumer money.

When I was between jobs recently, I got a Marketplace plan - having insurance was only possible for me because of those subsidies. COBRA would have been prohibitively expensive, as would any of the private, unsubsidized insurance plans on the market.

cvalcr9,0,t1_cvajbih,the_sam_ryan,">Obama talks about people putting pressure on state insurance regulators to scrutinize the premium increases. Looks like that's not happening.

I think the difference is that scrutinize in that context isn't review, its force to go lower at a loss.  Which is why healthcare co-ops are failing across the nation, they set the premiums below the cost of care and failed.

>I happen to be for universal healthcare, but I think Dems will have to be very clear and careful in their messaging on this issue in 2016.

Universal healthcare is great in theory when its preventative care and rationed, coupled with private health insurance for further activities.  Unfortunately we have a system that has been forced in place that will make affordable universal healthcare dogshit and make decent care out of the reach of most Americans.  

Medicare is rejected by the majority of primarily care doctors, as the reimbursement rate is constantly and retroactively going lower and the delay to pay is so long.  It also treats patients as an assembly line, which means that while those without insurance may see a doctor, its shit care and it drags the middle class's healthcare down to fund it.  

And we don't want to become Canada or UK, where times to get treatment are delayed and slow, especially seen by the lower investment in pharma as a result of lower funding.   You see less and less breakthroughs and more and more slow incremental movement due to lower funding for drugs, as they have to recoup the costs to research.  ",1,0,1442953818,1444725475

What I do wonder, and am having trouble finding info on at this point, is if after 2016, the rate hikes might slow dramatically? Is it possible that because so many people who never had healthcare before now finally had access to medical care, they received expensive procedures/drugs/treatments etc. that made the premium hikes so large, to deal with the large up-front costs of treating a disadvantaged populace? 

If that's the case, then maybe now that people are healthier after finally getting long-term issues taken care of, rate increases will slow in the future. Short-term pain, long-term gain kind of thing. ",2,0,1442953723,1444725475

With Democrats unlikely to make much in the way of gains in either the House or Senate, and even if they did I'm not sure if after almost a decade in the wilderness Nancy would for her first act, pass a bill massively increasing government control over healthcare on a slim party-line only margin.

However, double digit rate increases, even if not in your area, can be exploited to death.  Do you think Republicans will mention that its only a few plans in a few cities?
