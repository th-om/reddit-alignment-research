These are mostly  ""gun-free zones"".

>The study results identified 73 (45.6%) of 160 incidents that occurred in areas of commerce.

■ Military properties (5 [3.1%])
■ Residences (7 [4.4%]);

The majority of these places are in fact ""gun free zones"".

It seems to suggest the shooter just gives up and commits suicide as if it is somehow unrelated to the police response or being caught. I find that to be very disingenuous - when in many of these cases the guy doesn't give up until he hears the sirens and commits suicide - or commits suicide because he finally killed the person he wanted to kill - but in any of these scenarios the suicide happens because he has no intention of going to jail or trial. It seems to be hastened by the sound of sirens or any chance of being caught.

Even in this study, when it lists some of the incidents it is reporting on they end over and over as ""The shooter committed suicide after police arrived. "" or ""The shooter committed suicide before police arrived."" or ""The shooter was killed by federal law enforcement officers.""... The overwhelming majority of end scenarios is either the police kill the shooter or the shooter shoots himself to avoid trial and capture.

The high number of unarmed people who restrain the shooter seems to me to lean more to the argument that someone who has a gun and uses it to return fire would be a likely outcome had one of those people had a gun.

And in absolutely none of these scenarios is it described as ""A guy who has a concealed carry permit just loses it one day and decides to shoot everyone around him because he has a gun on him.""

>However, in 45 of the 160 incidents where law enforcement did engage a shooter, law enforcement suffered casualties in 21 (46.7%) of the incidents, resulting in 9 officers killed and 28 wounded.

I'd be interested to see what, if any, were civilians shot by police or other armed citizens.

> A majority of the 160 incidents (90 [56.3%]) ended on the shooter’s initiative before the police arrived

Sounds like a good reason to not wait for the police to get there. As well, they again make it sound like the guy just changed his mind and gave up... this isn't really the case at all. Suicide or death by police, these people are not looking to just give up - as this summary sentence leads a person to believe. When you read the facts in the paper they state:

>In all, 64 (40.0%) of the shooters ultimately committed suicide
