3myxq0,"How do people feel bout Russia replacing the US as the ""policeman"" of the Middle East?",74,Honest_Discussion,"Alot has been made in the news lately about Russia (with the help of a newly rich Iran) and their engagement in dealing with ISIS and the Syrian Civil War. Both Donald Trump and the Left seem to agree that the US can not continue trying to fix everything in the Middle East and if Russia wants to kill ISIS, let them. 

However, many on the Right fear that if that happens, many other Arab States will then become aligned with Russia and Iran in destroying ISIS. Once ISIS is destroyed, Russia and Iran will essentially be in charge of a ~~1/4~~ 1/6 of the world's land and ~~85%~~ 55% of the world's oil. 

Am I wrong about this? Is this a big deal to anybody else?
