3lgjti,"(Hypothetical) Carly Fiorina called for no talks with Russia and an increase in military exercises, what would be the consequences?",15,kcash935,"As I stated, Fiorina proposed not talking to Putin, increasing the Navy's 6th Fleet, conducting aggressive military exercises in the Baltic states, among selling bombs and arms to others. 

If this route were taken, in my opinion, Russia would obviously not take kindly and it would lead to the brink of war. China would likely be on Russia's side (unless I'm missing something) among others.

Do you think our allies would join us, be too war weary, or would something happen prior that would derail this entire scenario (obviously barring Fiorina not getting elected)?

As I said, completely hypothetical and just wanting to promote some discussion.

Please no Republican/Democrat bashing. I enjoy informative/educated responses. ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lgjti/hypothetical_carly_fiorina_called_for_no_talks/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442598711,1444727024
