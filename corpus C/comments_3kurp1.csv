cv125b9,1,t3_3kurp1,LiberalTerryN,"There are a couple reasons. First, there's the revenue. Plainly, raising taxes from corporations raises revenue, and any reduction in corporate taxes would probably need to come from somewhere else.

Second, the tax code is complicated because of all the different subsidies that Congress has put into place. For political reasons, many direct subsidies aren't popular, so when Congress wants to encourage retirement savings, home ownership, small business creation, oil exploration, renewable energy investment, broad health insurance coverage, charitable giving, etc., it creates tax credits and tax deductions to encourage that behavior. For corporate behavior, taking away the baseline tax rate will take away the carrots in the form of tax deductions. Will employers still provide health insurance coverage when it is no longer deductible from income? Will individuals themselves buy as much insurance if they have to pay for it with after-tax earnings?

There's just a lot of reliance in the system built on the assumption that corporate taxes exist. We could tear the whole thing down and build up something in its place, but that will require individualized program by program design of replacement subsidies and replacement revenue sources to avoid the worst of unintended consequences.",2,0,1442233504,1444729274
cv0sd8e,1,t3_3kurp1,AMatterofTrust,"The purpose is simple, raise revenue. 

And it does raise $100 billion dollars a year, so it is not all bad. 

That being said, it is one of the least efficient taxes (think:100 billion dollars for a country that holds the 10 highest grossing companies in the world.) It taxes Corporations at a 35% rate, one of the highest in the developed world, yet brings in only 1.8% of GDP. This is mainly because of deductions that the government should get rid of but won't (for example, deductions for charity will have to go, but no one wants that). Additionally, it is anti-growth. However, what is efficient, income taxation and a progressive sales tax, will get you voted out of office immediately. 

Additionally, the compliance costs for it are very high. 

The majority of economists want to lower corporate tax rates, and a growing number want to eliminate it entirely. [Here](http://www.nber.org/data-appendix/w19757/CorporateTaxPaper.pdf) is a paper outlining an argument in favor of its elimination. 

However, this is a hard sell to people. You would tell people that their sales tax will rise by a little bit, say 2%, costing them a bit of money each year. Actually it won't be 2% because it is a progressive system, which almost nobody will understand. Additionally, income taxes will rise. In exchange the economy will grow by a bit, about 5% over a decade, about 0.5% a year, and wages will rise, you in fact are making money. 

**The latter argument does not work well with people.** People can see the money taken out of their paycheck every year. If they get a raise, they attribute it to their company, not a extremely complicated network of events that comes from the removal of the tax. It is harder to see. So if income taxes are raised, people will feel like they are losing money, when in reality the removal of the corporate tax gave them some. 

It is like NAFTA in a way. Though wages rose and unemployment fell, people can see people in manufacturing sectors lose there jobs, and the increase in service sector jobs is attributed to coincidence, not **a series of complicated events that ultimately stem from NAFTA.**

So while a lot of economists want it lowered and some eliminated, the public says no. Because economists act in the greatest good, what will benefit the people the most objectively, whereas the public votes on what feels to be the case, and it is hard to see long term benefits, (5% over a **decade**) especially if it involves short-term sacrifice.
