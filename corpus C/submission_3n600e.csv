3n600e,Perfect Presidential Candidate (PPC),16,bhensley86,"My name is Brian, i'm 29 years old, married with one child and an engineer and this is my perfect candidate:

1) lower taxes on anyone under $600,000/year  (i'm in the $70k range and raising a family debt free and living the American dream is hard)
2) Term limits on all of congress (one term, 6 years).
3) Someone that believes in the constitution before their political party
4) Remove political parties off ballets and make it about peoples character and intelligence (its how all current companies run their business). 
5) Don't lie to the people, if you promise something in your campaign and you're voted in, fight for those things
6) Make Social Security optional or remove it. Millennials think its a waste since they're told they won't get anything back.
7) bring more offshore jobs home, no option is off the table to get it done
8) Put class size limits in place for education, hire more teachers if needed. Make it a priority. 
9) Congress should be paid their home states average salary. 
10) If congress can't pass bills, or keep this country running, then they're suspended without pay with no hopes of getting it back.
11) corporations need limits on political donation sizes. $10k max. 

Thank you.
