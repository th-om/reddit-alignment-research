Let's say hypothetically that Fiorina laid off workers, but also took a 50% pay cut for herself and her executives, and basically did everything she could to save as many jobs as possible while keeping the company competitive. Even if she had to lay off large numbers of people, the hate wouldn't be there.

There are other ways to contain cost. 

Lay offs aren't the only way. They're an easy way. It's not a very creative solution. And it's viewed as a heartless approach.

Romney bought up companies that were failing, his company never actually had any finical problems.

In the case of HP you have a point.

>companies often lay off people despite being profitable. they just weren't profitable ENOUGH. cause its never enough, right?

If you can make more money by laying people off why wouldn't you? Companies exist to make money for their owners not to give out money to people who don't profit them.

Then don't by iPhones and Macbooks.

The jobs are being done in those countries because they're far better then what's already aviable. This also allows us to purchase goods for cheaper here in America.

because having knowledgeable experienced people might be better than having a disposable turnover workforce? then things get done more efficiently because the employees actually know the job, industry, processes? because it foster a sense of ownership and that increases productivity, whereas the opposite drives down productivity? 

*companies often provide the least possible amount of service and often it isn't enough. Apple recently reduced the number of people in their call enters and hold times have grown. -- Then don't by iPhones and MacBooks.*

thats my argument, why do you think it supports your POV?

to clarify: company cuts workers, services suffers, sales falter, profits suffer, leading to ""restructuring"" and job losses. all this because of bad management. who suffers? the workers. I should emphasize that its bad UPPER management. lower management can get caught in the job losses just as easily even though they had shit to do with what got them there. but upper management rarely suffers and makes the really big bucks.

Those are cases in which the cost of laying someone off outweighs the benefits, that decisions is complicated and I think people who run their company understand the effects you listed above will have on it more then you do.

>to clarify: company cuts workers, services suffers, sales falter, profits suffer, leading to ""restructuring"" and job losses. all this because of bad management. who suffers? the workers.

Why are profits suffering? Is it because a competitor has come into the market to offer superior service? Then the workers can just go work for the new guy who doesn't suck.
