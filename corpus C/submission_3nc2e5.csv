3nc2e5,There is a lot of discussion about mental health access and treatment in the wake of mass shootings. While a good idea on general principle is there any evidence that there are significantly many more mentally disturbed people in the US compared to developed countries without mass shootings?,97,passionlessDrone,"I am of the opinion that mental illness is likely more of less uniformly distributed, if not uniformly diagnosed.  Within that context, I find the claims that the US problem with mass shootings to be one based in deficiencies in mental health care to be somewhat lacking; if every country has roughly the same number of mentally disturbed people per capita, shouldn't they have the same number of mass killings as the US?  They don't, and the reason to my eye is the simple reality that guns make it so easy to kill a lot of people that an unhinged person in Japan doesn't have the same *capacity to kill* that an unhinged person in Oregon has.  

If there is evidence that the US does have more mentally ill people per capita that other industrialized countries, I would be happy to read it.  Alternatively, is there evidence that access to mental health care is that much superior in other industrialized countries? 

I'm all in favor  in favor of improved access to mental health care, and I think it should be part of a solution for violence issues and as moving forward as a society as a whole.  It just seems shortsighted to think that this is the primary driver of a problem that seems to fall solely within the borders of the US.

On a similar vein, the 'deterioration of society' argument is often used; I'm not saying that things aren't different than they used to be, but I have been to r/wtfjapan and I don't think we have a monopoly on ""changing"" social norms.  We do seem to have a near monopoly on mass killings though.
