The effects under study are so small that they exceed the margin of error for the earnings data we have available, its not a question that can currently be answered objectively.

Consensus is split down the middle but generally in the absence of other policy choices (an NIT would be vastly superior to the MW) moderate raises of the MW (to $9-$10) are well supported even by those who would prefer other poverty control mechanisms (IE ones which actually do help manage poverty). 

The $15 MW is not well supported even by those economists who strongly support the MW. Dube is the most prolific pro-MW publisher currently and even [his estimates](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/06/19_hamilton_policies_addressing_poverty/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf) of the maximum MW without disemployment effects fall well short of $15 everywhere in the country.

The issue people seem to miss is the level of the optimal MW has absolutely nothing to do with individual need or how much we would like people to earn at the wage floor, its a function of the size of the low-income labor market which calculates the efficiency wage for MW workers. Ultimately if we want people to earn more then this we need to transfer it to them, a higher MW then its optimal point will reduce incomes for MW workers rather then increase them.

Or more accurately, the measurements are overly broad, using occupational categories like ""physician"" making no distinction between pediatricians and neurosurgeons.

Women who earn law degrees are more likely to become paralegals while men become lawyers.

But yes, you can think you've had a thorough examination because broad occupational labeling, even though the failure to distinguish within even those categories shows great variability in earnings.

Heck, even in nursing, a field women dominate, men outearn women as they work more hours, work less sociable hours such as nights and weekends, stay in the workforce longer and more continuously, and pursue more nursing specialties.

>Women full-
time 
workers earn less than men full-time workers in nearly every major, although the size of the gap 
varies. In education, a female
-dominated major and occupation, women earn 95 percent as much 
as their male colleagues earn. In bio
logy, a mixed
-gender field, women earn only 75 percent as 
much as men earn, just one year after graduation.  

That's interesting. Unfortunately what it ignores is that full time is working any number of hours past 35. Of course women are overrepresented among workers working 35-39 hours, and men are overrepresented among those working 40 or more. Even limiting it to those working more than 40 and thus earning overtime, men working 3 times the overtime hours women who work over time do on average.

For every age, even for the same marital status and number of children men work more hours than their female counterparts.

>a portion of these pay gaps remains 
unexplained and is likely due to discrimination.  

Sorry but this is basically saying ""I can't explain it, therefore I can explain it.""

You have to show evidence of discrimination. You don't get to say ""hey so we did a kind of analysis and looked at some factors, and it doesn't explain everything, ignoring the factors known to affect earnings that are harder to quantify such as negotiation and taking more in benefits in lieu of wages, so the difference must be discrimination.""

Your point of view: ""Male and female neurophysiology is EXACTLY the same and their brains process all types of information EXACTLY the same way and solve all types of problems EXACTLY the same way! Anyone who thinks that males and females have evolved slightly different mental strengths which were advantageous to their survival is a dirty sexist pig!""

Differences between males and females have been been studied extensively for many, many years. To dispute scientific evidence is a desperate attempt to legitimize a personal belief. Nobody is saying ""women suck at math and men are geniuses."" The evidence simply states that when a population of millions of men and women is taken into account, women's results are clustered more closely to the median than men's, who have slightly more representation at the low and high ends of the spectrum. This is why we see more men with significantly sub-par intelligence / mental disabilities, and more men in the 99th percentile and above in the IQ spectrum (yes, I know IQ isn't a direct measurement of intelligence, but it is a good measurement of problem solving, quantitative analysis, and other skills that are used not only in mathematics but also most high-income occupations. 

Chess, for example, is something that involves problem solving, strategic thinking, memory, calculations, and reasoning - all skills that top CEOs/engineers/lawyers rely upon. Traditionally all chess international grandmasters were men, causing the belief that boys were more gifted at this type of thinking than women. Women, however, believes it was because boys were taught chess from a young age in these European countries and girls were not. Now, during the past few decades where women have gained many rights in society, these places have begun to train girls the same way in an effort to treat both genders equally. In addition, many people have began to find young girls with prodigious intelligence who are gifted at chess, and give them chess lessons with grandmasters for years, in order to prove that female brains were equal to male brains in this type of thinking. The results? After decades of trying and thousands of girls trained for countless hours... The list of the world's top players is still almost exclusively male. The top 1000 has about 100 females, and the top 100 has 2. The top 50 has 0. No female has ever even come close to being top 10 or top 20, let alone #1. This is after 40-50 years of countless women training for their entire lives. However, if you look at a group of 1000 novice players, half men and half women, the distribution will be roughly equal. This is because, like I said, the median is the same for both genders; it's just at the far ends of the spectrum, men represent the majority.


This concept applies directly to the workforce. Average men and women aren't the CEOs of big corporations - these CEOs are the ""far end of the spectrum"" people, they are the best of the best in the areas of strategic thinking, leadership, problem solving, etc. It is no surprise most CEOs are men. 


Also, I don't see why the majority of CEOs being men is something that ""needs to be fixed."" The majority of nurses are female. The majority of care-workers are female. There is no reason that all professions MUST consist of 50% males and 50% females. 

""High paying positions like top lawyers/top engineers are predominantly males which = sexism."" You're forgetting other 6 figure income professions: top strippers and top pornstars. These people make at least 6 figures, sometimes even 7 figures. Guess what? Almost exclusively female! What about the males who want to be a porn star making millions but can't because sexism? You may say ""sexism/objectifying women /pig!"" Go watch interviews with these stars, they love their job and choose to do it so let them do what they want. There's no big bad sexist men taking advantage of poor girls being forced to do porn to survive. These women love their work and make piles of money. 

So when it comes to SAT math scores, it should be expected that overall more boys are top scorers than girls - it's our neurophysiology and that's okay. You may think ""women are discouraged from taking math classes so less girls are in top math classes and less score high on the SAT."" Well, that may have been the case 50-70 years ago, but not anymore. My AP Calc class in high school was about 20 girls and 10 guys. 12 girls passed the AP test, 8 girls didn't. 8 guys passes the AP test, 2 didn't. 2 guys scored a perfect 5 on it, 0 girls got a perfect score. Everyone was talking about our results when we got them, and when I noticed this I asked my teacher about it, and he said the results are usually distributed like that.

I feel bad that you put all this effort in.  

I understand the argument that men are more widely distributed on the curve, but it has fundamental flaws.

First of all, I cited a paper that specifically refuted the idea that men are more widely distributed than women.  Secondly, I have never once ever seen anything that suggested that there are more dumb men than there are dumb women.  Third, the fundamental flaw in all this testing is that it takes place when the men and women are adults.  The way a child is raised has massive effects on how intelligent they are later in life.  Children who play dress up with Barbies won't develop the same as children who play with legos and erector sets.  Which leads to another point, that just because men and women are legally equal, doesn't mean that society still treats them as equals.  ",1,0,1442733782,1444728828
cv9u57j,0,t1_cv7pu75,PoonSafari,"You feel bad I spent so much time typing....  some short paragraphs? I'm not sure how long it takes you to type a paragraph but I'm a little worried that I'm debating a child if you think that takes more than a few minutes... Hopefully you're just a slow adult. 

Ask yourself this: why are you so desperately clinging to the idealistic and impossible notion that men and women have brains that are built exactly the same way and function exactly the same way? I'm not saying that men are more intelligent than women, or vice versa. They just have slight differences (very slight, relative to the entire animal kingdom). Why is that a bad thing? We already know it to be factually true that the neurophysiology of male and female is not the same, as well as other things that affect brain functions like biochemistry and hormonal balances. Based on these facts, it is to be expected that there will be some slight differences in brain function. We are just still trying to figure out what exactly those differences are, and we've got a good general idea but haven't proved it definitively or nailed down details thoroughly.

Anyways, on to the study you said specifically refutes my claim and that's the end of it (most adorable thing you've written by the way). One paper with dubious evidence from a mediocre source does not automatically refute the idea of men being represented more than women along the extremes of quantitative abilities. Regardless of your cherry-picking a study just because it supports the minority opinion among scientific studies on this issue, I will still respond as if it were an impressive study with excellent sample size, quality peer-review, published In a prestigious journal science with rigorous requirements.

First, your study is on IQ, and quantitative abilities are only one element of IQ. It does not specifically discuss mathematical abilities or any other quantitative skill. Even if men and women are neurologically exactly the same (which is factually false), and women and men are represented exactly equally throughout the entire IQ spectrum (which the majority of studies show to be false), this does not prove or even suggest that women and men perform equally well at advanced and abstract mathematical tasks. 

Second, the fact that you posted one single study and then stated that this proves you are correct and I am incorrect, shows what little experience you have in both academic debate and scientific research. Even if you posted 100 studies that supported your argument, if the conclusion that the studies support is the *minority opinion* among the scientific community/studies on that issue, then it is unlikely to be true. I'm not saying that my stance is factually true, I'm saying the *majority of studies* on the subject support my claim, making it more likely to be true. Both of our stances are entirely possible. 

Next, you suggest that studies done on adults are flawed because childhood activities segregated by gender can affect intelligence, like Barbie vs Lego. 
1) the study you cited sampled adults, why cite a study as the foundation of your argument if you believe it to be flawed (and then tell me exactly how it's flawed)? 2) Sure, I agree childhood activities can affect intelligence to some small degree. But again, the *majority* of scientific studies on ""nature vs nurture"" indicate that while upbringing can affect adult intelligence to a small extent (so small that a common debate is if it is statistical error or actually due to upbringing), it is primarily based on genetics and physiology. 

You said I confuse fantasy with reality due to the fact that I said many women enjoy their careers in porn and are not forced into it by sexist men taking advantage of desperate women. What world do you live in? A parallel universe without Google apparently. You can go see for yourself, watch interviews with porn stars (actual interviews, not the ones in the porn videos meant to turn guys on), or go read the books they have written (Sasha Grey for example is fairly well spoken and write well). Sure there are bad stories, but those are the minority, just like other careers for *both genders.* Please note I'm not talkinhb about sex trafficking, which is a vile crime, I'm just talking about adult actresses in the US, who you seem to believe do not enjoy their careers and are somehow forced into it by the wicked patriarchy?

Finally, resorting to calling names and insulting the other party as a means of strengthening your side of a debate is a clear indicator that you do not possess the maturity nor the intelligence to have a rational discussion about an idea, so this will be my final response, as I have no doubt you will reply with more of the same.

There is a lot of dispute on whether the minimum wage in general or if small increases would hurt employment but doubling it overnight would certainly have a big impact on employment. This means winners (those with higher paying jobs) and losers (those with no jobs) and it's up to you whether the cost is equal to the benefit.

* Free college tuition would almost certainly mean more money going to diploma mills that are basically stealing money from kids these days. Give us $50,000 (that you can borrow) and we will give you a piece of paper that is practically worthless in the job market. This problem could be fixed by requiring stricter standards on what college is but the federal government isn't doing that now so seems unlikely they would under Sanders. Right now college education is ""free"" because people can borrow enough money to pay for it from the federal government.

The big problem with this is that blue collar workers are now subsidizing college tuition. Seems unfair to me.

* Gender gap is a myth in how it is often portrayed but it is real. The issue is that women work in lower paid professions and take more time off from their career.

Your comparison is not flawed, just that, like the rest of STEM the fields, the sub fields of medicine are strongly stratified by gender leaving a lot of women in a few fields and mostly men in the rest.

The are no significant social norms stopping women from going into STEM. They get into school easier. School's cheaper for them. When in school they get academic help specifically targeted at them. Once they get out of school they're preferring by a 2:1 rate over men. The president talks about how their needs to be more of them in STEM.

I personally don't believe that will even come close to paying for it, but whatever, Bernie does. He then goes on to suggest a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. That's going to cost a lot more than the college plan and he's provided *no* funding mechanism for that.

Easy example here is the recent Walmart increase in minimum pay to $10/h, this has had no impact on the prices they charge for goods (mostly due to efficiency wage, the increase in labor cost was offset by a fall in labor turnover cost).
* In terms of the MW inflationary effects occur because income, and thus consumption, increases. At the current level of the MW these effects are statistically insignificant (simply not enough MW workers to make the effect significant).
* A $15mw without disemployment effects would certainly increase the inflationary effect but it would still be incredibly small, possibly statistically significant but still insignificant for the policy discussion.
* In reality a $15mw is so far beyond the [optimal MW](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/06/19_hamilton_policies_addressing_poverty/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf) everywhere in the country that the disemployment effects would be significant.

percent of all wage and salary workers. Among those

federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. About 1.7 million

cv2ab57,1,t3_3kz2lr,awa64,"> Wouldn't a large increase in minimum wage cause inflation across the board?

No. You can prevent the shock of a sudden increase in expenses by spacing the increase out over time, which is the main concern, and every recent local minimum wage hike has shown that the growth in income outpaces the increase to the cost of living.

> Wouldn't free college tuition create an extremely over saturated market in college graduates

No. Several of the countries that provide free college tuition have lower graduation rates than the US does. The ease of access to loans means the vast majority of people who want to go to college in the US already do—making it free would help to correct the economy-depressing, entrepreneurship-killing levels of student loan debt carried by Americans, going forward, but would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the number of graduates.

> And hasn't the gender gap in wages been proven to be a statistical myth when position is controlled for?

No, even after controlling for position, education/experience, and time in the workforce,  there's still a 9-cent gap. If you look across all job titles, the higher-paying the job is, the wider the pay gap is, too.

Plus, whether or not people *should* control for position when discussing this issue is a conversation we need to have. Gender segregation of jobs is a real problem too.

> Yes, wealth inequality is an issue and many forms of media have shoved it down our throats for years now but is Sanders' really saying anything new

He's not saying anything new. He's saying the same stuff the New Keynesians and Post-Keynesians have been saying for the past 40 years. Thankfully, people are taking the New Keynesians and Post-Keynesians seriously again and starting to see the Austrian school policies parroted by the right for the jokes they really are.",1,0,1442323197,1444728844
cv2co2w,1,t3_3kz2lr,stolt,"> And hasn't the gender gap in wages been proven to be a statistical myth when position is controlled for?

Statistical economist here,

No....Not really. What has been proven is that SOME (but not ALL) of the gender wage gap can be attributable factors which you can control for. The skeptic's line of logic in this case is that ""if we control for enough stuff, we'll eventually find the right combination of control factors to make the GPG statically negligible"". 

Since I live in  Europe (where we have EU-level data on this issue, by age, by part-time status, by country, and by sector), I can say that here in Europe, if you are willing to get so hyper-specific about things, there are some small places where the GPG is either statistically negligible, or negative. for example

- Females who work in either the construction or waste-water management industry AND live in either the scandinavian states, slovenia, or Luxembourg statically do not face a gender pay gap. 

- Homosexual females do not face a gender pay gap. 

But the general, aggregate situation is that all oecd countries have a GPG, and that most sectors of the economy have labormarket demand such that men earn the higher salary. Here in the EU, it happens to be especially the case in the financial/banking and IT industries (which are the two industries which most drive the economy). 

If the US would publish stats with a sectoral breakdown, they'd likely find the same thing. Which is to say that a woman could probably earn the same as a man, but to do it, she's have to be willing to move to Iceland, get a job in the waste-water management industry, or/and change her sexual orientation.

cv2gvun,1,t3_3kz2lr,onwardtowaffles,">For example, wouldn't a large increase in minimum wage cause inflation across the board?

Sure, prices of consumer goods would go up. But for the vast majority of minimum wage earners, whose primary expense is rent (or mortgage payments), it's a massive net gain.

>Wouldn't free college tuition create an extremely over saturated market in college graduates as well as directly cause a proportional increase in federal taxes to provide functional schools across the nation?

The market already requires college degrees for most jobs. Thus, millions of Americans selling themselves into long-term irrevocable debt just to get a job. Get rid of that enormous drain on purchasing power, and we'll likely see a substantial increase in consumer spending.

>And hasn't the gender gap in wages been proven to be a statistical myth when position is controlled for?

...No. Control for position if you like. Sure, some are close to equal, but the ones that aren't (in the majority, by the way) are even worse off than that average figure of 70 cents on the dollar would suggest.

>Yes, wealth inequality is an issue and many forms of media have shoved it down our throats for years now but is Sanders' really saying anything new or is he just using an idealistic platform to abuse the naivety of left-wing thinkers that don't understand basic economic concepts?

Basic economic concepts like Keynesian economics? Not saying you're flat wrong, but you are definitely underestimating the effects of giving the majority of Americans the ability to spend their money on something other than debt.
