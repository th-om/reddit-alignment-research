I also think writing George Bush off is not a winning strategy.

(Romney also would have had to never made the 47% remarks).

But instead Romney promised he would do what Obama was doing on foreign policy and couldn't explain why Bengahzi happened.

Foreign policy seems to be the one thing that has kept Rubio in the spotlight - but Rubio seems to be charging down that same exact ""Throw Bush Under The Bus"" path.

Why would anyone vote for the GOP candidate who tells them the last GOP president was a failure?

That link shows George W Bush outpolling Obama, Clinton and having 57% of republicans state that Bush as an advisor is a good asset. There are many polls like this.

The meme for idiots and politicians who live by popularity memes is ""BUSHITLER WAS THE WORST EVER!""... but in reality that is not the view of the majority.

They split about even in 2000 and 2004 actually. Right at around 50%. And they also don't like Hillary much either.

I don't think any political adviser would say ""It's a sound strategy"". But I also think they are mostly lemmings and lemmings don't win an election. Leaders do. People who are confident in what they believe, and can illustrate how they are carrying the torch for a long view of politics.
