Thats why its used as a rally cry b/c you can scream it all day and then ignore it.  It literally has no definable meaning in real life.  The best political rally points are abstract b/c you can never be held responsible for them.  It is core cowardice in politics. Conservatives and Libertarians are quite consistently cowards in politics.  They rarely make a substantial definable stance and the times they have it typically backfires (gov shut down, oppose ACA, marriage rights, voting rights, union busting, etc).  They are often peddling ignorance with abstracts and it works on uneducated populace (see stats, this is a fact not an opinion).

Liberals on the other hand use a similar trick with a slight twist.  Their abstracts come in the form of actual execution.  They'll talk about supporting middle class but then execution ends up becoming compromise that doesnt quite help unions but does end up helping the bottom line of big banks or tech.  Same with lobby busting, transparency, limited military expansion, etc.  They start with explicit policy plan but then have to back down from actually achieving it due to the political landscape (which is often BS b/c they'll be in control of all chambers or vast majority and just happen to not have the votes - yet two days later pass a bill on security that limits freedom of X w/o a problem).

Not trying to convert you by any means, but just a personal anecdote. I've had an odd political evolution. Started out a Neo-Con, then was a libertarian for several years who held the outlook I just quoted.  

One of the little creeping thoughts that pushed me from being a libertarian to a solid ""third way"" liberal was this: ""Let's say we set a limited number of things the government can do one day. What if 20 years later, we find something on our list that the government can do, but now some other institution can do it better. Wouldn't we be ok with privatizing that thing?

On the flip side, what if 20 years later we find there's something that there's something the government can do better than other institutions, but that *isn't* on our list? Should we just say 'yeah, the government could do this better than those other institutions, but it's not on our list, so let's not do it?'""

With that thought, it seems to make more sense to say ""let's make a category of the things a particular government can do, not lists.  If we think it's something they could do more efficiently than some other institution like a market, and it's in that category, then let's try it out.  If it's outside the category, let's expand the category or find the government whose powers include that category.  Whatever the solution is, it shouldn't be artificially constrained by lists just because the list exists.  Limits on government should serve us, not vice versa. If there's a problem that needs to be solved, we should solve it using whatever the most efficient and effective institution is, whether it's the individual, the family, the market, non-profits, or the government.""

cv2rtrm,0,t1_cv2jx06,epicwinguy101,"Sure, I agree that it would be silly to lock yourself into a single course of action.  I'm not sure if I could call myself a libertarian so much as business conservative, given my strong preference for efficiency and pragmatism.  I think, perhaps, the only major difference between me and the liberals on this sort of topic is the expectations of efficiency I have from each arena, especially on the government side of things.  

I think that people who want to expand government programs and services into new arenas tend to look at the flaws in our real, existing market (and these flaws are sometimes quite real), and compare them to a hypothetical ideal government program.  Naturally, if you envision a program where the government gets everything perfectly right, like I imagine many who champion these causes do, even an efficient market would not compete with state control.  I, however, do not see the government getting things so perfectly or efficiently in practice (growing up near Chicago did admittedly give me a dim view), so I generally need a compelling to convince me why government intervention is necessary in a market, far moreso so for it to assume control of it.  Things like market failure and the like are compelling reasons.  Gauging how efficient or not a given government institution is pretty difficult to do ahead of time, so I'd rather err on the side of caution, and assume that in general it does not deliver goods or services with the efficiency of a business.  

That said, I think that a key advantage to changing these things slowly is a sense of stability and consistency.  For instance, if I am worried that all of the medical supply manufacturing will be nationalized in the near future, depending on who wins the election, I will be less likely to open or expand a business in medical supplies.  Such uncertainty can no doubt affect the overall system behavior, as people might not play the game if they are worried about the rules being changed on them in the middle of it.

That's the difference between me and a lot of liberals too, haha. 

If there's an economic problem, I will always look at how the market solves it first.  If there's a market failure (like I think there is with utilities) or moral dilemma with assigning the market to solve the problem (like with health care), I'd move to see if cities could solve it, then states, then the US.  

I'm also pretty conservative with my liberal solutions. That is, if we want to make an economic move, we better be looking to see how other countries have done it first, and how their reality has matched up to the theory. A good example is basic income. I'd love to see a smaller country try it and see what effect it has, but I'd probably be camping out in front of the capital protesting if the US Congress were considering it.

That's not how laws work. Statutes don't set precedent; they test it.  If the law wasn't constitutional, it would be struck down. If it was, it wouldn't.  The statute has no precedential value, though the case deciding its constitutionality does. 

Two other premises I would challenge: 

1. That the Individual Mandate would have been an ""egregious intrusion not only on personal liberties and freedoms, but also on the police power that is granted to individual states and not the federal government.""  While the Court didn't agree with me, I think they missed the more straightforward Commerce Clause argument. That is ""The IM isn't regulating inactivity: *Everyone* participates in the health care market at some point in their lives. More than 17% of our GDP is spent on health care. Due to our economic model, insurance is the way that we pay for the health care that everyone receives.""  But the court rejected that, so I'm ok letting it go.  

2. This tidbit: ""If we allow the government to force an individual to enter into a market (that the market may or may not help the individual is not important; the only thing of importance is the forcing of an individual into that market unwillingly), **then we are allowing the government (i.e. Congress) to strip away a fundamental liberty: the right of choice.**""  

What in the world is ""The right of choice""? Where in the constitution is that? That's a phrase that's so broad it has no meaning.  Laws prohibiting murder rob me of my freedom of choice to kill people. Tax law robs me of my freedom to spend my money as I choose. *Any* law limits choice; that's why it's a law.

That is how laws work. A bill is written, passed, and then expanded upon when referenced in future bills and interpreted by the Supreme Court. So it does have value as a precedent - since it can be used to as a reference point for future bills. That's how the expansion of the Commerce Clause happened in the first place.

Which is a fine reason to dislike the Supreme Court's decision in *NFIB v. Sebelius*, but that doesn't really make sense as a reason to dislike the PPACA, which ties into your horse/cart problem.  You're looking at this backwards.  

Say there's a carnival ride with a requirement that riders [be over 48 inches to ride](http://www.bigsurfwaterpark.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/reqd-height-48.gif). Most riders are over 60 inches, but one day, someone comes up who looks a little short.  The carnie says ""wait a minute are you tall enough? Please stand next to the sign. The kid stands next to the sign and he's 49 inches.  Did the kid set a precedent for future riders? No! The sign was always the same. The carnie was just applying the kid's height to the sign.  

As you probably picked up on, our sign is the constitution, the kid is the PPACA, and the carnie is SCOTUS.  The PPACA wasn't setting any constitutional precedent; it was just testing it.  We hadn't had something exactly like that come up before (which happens *a lot* in law), so the court reviewed it and 'had it stand next to the sign.' 

>That is how laws work. A bill is written, passed, and then expanded upon when referenced in future bills and interpreted by the Supreme Court.

I can't prove a negative, but I challenge you to find me one instance where a Supreme Court decision gives a statute precedential value on a constitutional issue.  You've got the relationship backwards.

Illness and injuries cause physical harm as well.  Should the government hire doctors?  Should the government *tax* me to pay for the doctors?

Even poverty causes physical harm.  Not having AC/heating causes physical harm.  Not being able to look up symptoms on the internet causes physical harm.  Being in jail causes physical harm.  Somehow the government needs to decide what kind of physical harm is physical enough for it to regulate.

Bombing other countries causes physical harm as well, both to our country's military and to the citizens of the other countries.  Where does that fall on the scale?

Libertarians do not believe in the social contract, essentially everything the harm principle would allow and some property rights are ""rights"" under libertarianism. Note the government, god, or anytihing else does not give you rights, rather, because the social contract does not exist, you have them by virtue of existing. 

Picture it like this. If the government did not regulate the air, the air would get dirty. Is clean air a right? A libertarian would say no, it is not, so long as no one is intentionally poisoning the air with the intent of killing people. Clean air in it of itself is not a right, but you do not have the right to poison the air. A right is again affirmative It is a right to do something, not from something. And indeed, when a right from something is considered a right, you run into major philosophical problems. If rights exist bey virtue of existing, how come a government is needed for you to have them? Regardless of where you fall in the spectrum, the idea that rights only exist because government exists is absurd. People being able to do whatever they want have all rights. Libertarians do not advocate for this, they are limitations, but the definition of ""right"" is clear. 

Note, what you described are not rights, but **externalities.** NOw, you correctly, if not intentionally, showed how externalities are the reason libertarian philosophy fails. Liberals want to regulate externalities. Conservatives internalize them.  There is a balance, and some should be ignored, but what should not be done is *ignore all externalities*. That is what libertarians, in my view, want to do. Rather, in reality they subscribe to *Austrian economics* which says a bunch of things about it, but in my looking at it is sums up to, ""ignore it."" The free market is a perfect system aside from negative externalities. Liberals want to make the market less free to deal with it, conservatives modify the rules slightly to preserve the free market and eliminate these exernalities, and libertarians ignore them. Which is why, after learning some economics, I abandoned libertarian philosophy entirely in favor of conservative philosophy. And the examples ou cited are why.

If you agree, assuming there is competition, you will seek to maximize your value among competitors. If you trade with me, I maximize your value. And yet, I am doing the same. The fact that we made this trade means we both maximize our respective value, hence it is a ""perfect"" system, meaning everyone maximizes his or value. Imagine this process taking place over millions of transactions, and you see why. 

Now we make important assumptions. We assume that the producers of the product are honest. They are not, that is why there is regulation. And regulation is not a problem to the aspect of a free market, so long as it does not restrict competition. We assume there is competition. The definition of free trade is that there is unrestricted competition. So we can make the assumption that there is unrestricted competition. If companies, not the government even, impose a barrier to entry, say by collusion, the market is no longer free. Would you call the market cable companies are in ""free?""

Yeah, but it's not so simple.  In a ""perfect"" world (a place full of massless pulleys, frictionless planes, and perfect black bodies), you sell widgets and I sell aidgets, and there are several other independent sellers of widgets and aidgets.  I actually want widgets and you actually want aidgets, so we decide to make a trade based on what we both negotiate the value of those two types of items to be.  In a slightly less imaginary situation, I couldn't care less about your widgets, so you're offering me shit for my valuable aidgets.  So we decide to use currency instead of trading widgets for aidgets.  In this even more slightly less imaginary world, you happen to live next door to my aidget store and the nearest other aidget store is in the next town over.  So I charge double for my aidgets because it's not worth the trouble for you to travel all the way over there to get aidgets, and our town's market can't support two aidget producers.  Meanwhile, there's a widget store in every corner and they make better widgets than you, so you're poor.  And so on.

The main thing that this trade does *not* mean is a satisfactory distribution of widgets and aidgets in society.  In fact, it isn't even close.  Letting the market set the value of widgets and aidgets may maximize my utility and your utility, but it makes plenty of other people very unhappy.  You call it an ""externality"", but that trivializes the issue.  You sell coal to me, which I burn.  That doesn't just affect some island person somewhere.  It affects *all of the residents of the town*.

The free market is ""perfect"" only under theoretical ideal conditions, and its utility falls away *quickly* as the conditions become less ideal.  Externalities are the dominant force, not the free market.  The free market, as a ""perfect"" system, is not set up to actually achieve positive externalities and avoid negative ones, because the free market is completely agnostic.  It does whatever it does, based on the value attributed to the goods by its participants.  The free market is a useful theoretical construct, but in practice, it doesn't result in the outcomes we as a society are interested in -- it just wasn't designed to do that.

That's generally OK.  The problem is when certain groups of people try to idolize the free market as an ideal that we should aspire to.  This is naturally preposterous, because the externalities dominate.

Because lawsuits are now how businesses are regulated, once my lawsuit against the bank, and the 611 class action lawsuits I'm a part of against various electric companies, sewage treatment, and oil processing companies go through, I could be looking at some pretty nice paychecks, especially if they can figure out whose fault the groundwater poisoning that almost killed me is. It's probably a couple hundred of them, so I'll hope the judges decide to split the liability among the whole lot, and that the polluters don't figure out how much cheaper it is to bribe the judge than it would be to follow regulations or pay for damages. 

Work has been tough lately, because wages have dropped sharply. Our salaries are set by the free market, and last month every business in town that employs people with my degree got together and decided on what the wage would be. Turns out it's much lower than what I was getting. I pointed out to my boss that he could pay just a little more and get the best people, but *he* pointed out that he'd agreed not to do that, and it's cheaper to hire two people at a third of the wage than one at a full salary. Also, since he's working from home now, they aren't paying for lights and heat in the building. So now I have to sue him about the wages, and file separate lawsuits about the working conditions and having to bring my own keyboard every day, as soon as I save up enough for another lawyer, he better watch out.

I'm guessing this came from here? That's pretty valid (mostly although yours seems to be an expanded list. Someone like say Ted Cruz would absolutely not be considered a libertarian). What's important to recognize is this is still a minority of the party. A fair portion of the democratic party has views similar to Bernie Sanders, but a far more sizable majority would be a moderate democrat like Clinton or Kerry, or someone like this. The leaders of the republican party are by and large not libertarians.

They call themselves libertarians, but actions are probably more important. Someone like a Robert A. Taft, or a Rand Paul who are pretty representative of the classical liberal movement would be appalled being grouped with Scott Walker and Ted Cruz.

>You might be too young to know this, but I know exactly when libertarians began to show up out of nowhere: sometime during the second term of George W. Bush

Yes, you know except the republican nomination in the 1964 election. There have always been libertarian republicans in congress, they have just recently become more vocal, and considered leaders of the party because it's trying to distance itself from the Bush era. 

But I don't want to loose what I'm really trying to say. Strait from the article you talked about:

>Libertarian Republicans often differ from traditional Republicans in their emphasis on protection of civil liberties.[1] It is distinct from the Republican Party because it sees state-enforced conservative social policies as encroachments on personal privacy and individual liberties.[1] Libertarian Republicans disagree with the activities of mainstream Republicans with regard to civil liberties since the September 11 attacks in 2001, opposing the PATRIOT Act, REAL ID, and President George W. Bush's domestic intelligence program.[2]

The libertarian wing is different than the standard republicans. The actual libertarian party is different than the libertarian republicans.

Anarchy is a pipe dream.

Second, limited government doesn't mean close to anarchy. It means that we don't make it the governments responsibility to run people's lives. It means that we don't want to give the government responsibility over things that it cannot possibly do well. Right now we are expecting our government to educate us, care for us when we are sick, take care of us when we are old, make sure that we are happy at our jobs, and a myriad of other things that we just don't have the manpower (without sapping all the other industries in our nation) to actually accomplish.

Citizens can be temporarily deputized too.

There is a continuum of government from anarchy to totalitarianism. 

Close to one extreme, you have rational anarchy. Robert Heinlein described rational anarchy fairly well in ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"". Pirate ships were reputedly organized with rational anarchy principles. A rational anarchist would say, ""my rights are unlimited up to the point where exercising my rights inhibits your ability to exercise yours"".  In other words, I'm not allowed to poison your well.

Libertarians aren't as extreme as rational anarchists. Both Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were Libertarians by todays definition even though they were bitterly opposed to each other's view of government. Libertarians generally believe that the powers granted to the federal government by the US Constitution are a reasonable set of limits particularly in light of the 10th amendment which states, ""Amendment X: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.""

Just because the federal government is not empowered to do something doesn't mean the states respectively or the people can't do it.

Ronald Reagan, said, ""The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help."" Those are the words every government uses while grabbing power and approaching totalitarianism.

People don't chose totalitarian governments knowing what they will get. People beg governments to ""help"" until one day, the help isn't optional.

I find Reagan's speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater in 1964 very persuasive and still relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXBswFfh6AY


By the way, At 10:09, Mr. Reagan advocates for a form of guaranteed minimum income!!! ""...this added to their income should eliminate poverty"" At 18:25 he talks about ending civil forfeiture ""...today, federal agents can invade a man's property without a warrant, impose a fine without a formal hearing let alone trial by jury, and they can seize and sell his property to enforce the payment of that fine.""


I believe Reagan addresses every point in this thread. He addresses ""They use terms like 'The Great Society' .. We must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of men ... the cold war will end through our acceptance of a not-un-democratic Socialism... The profit motive has become outmoded... it must be replaced ... our system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century."" Sen. Clark of Pensilvania defines Liberalism as ""Meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government."" ""... A government can not control the economy without controlling the people..."" ""We have so many people who can't see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one...""

Puerto Rico continues to court extremely wealthy Americans with recent breaks that can reduce some tax rates to zero, a tax regime that has lured hundreds of affluent Americans Puerto Rico hopes will put down roots – and cash.

'You could argue that the Puerto Rican economy was built on favorable tax treatment,' said Tracy Gordon, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Special tax breaks brought pharmaceutical jobs for decades to the island, she noted. Then the companies left when the breaks expired.

'You could also argue that with this tax strategy you’re trading on a house of cards,' Gordon added. 'If this goes away, well, there’s no guarantee anyone will have actually invested into Puerto Rico.'

'Certainly the federal government and states try to do a lot of tax credit zones, but there’s very mixed evidence of whether they work,' she said.""

Between 1970 and 1988, government employment [in Puerto Rico] doubled to almost 225,000.  By 1990, almost 25 percent of the labor force was employed by the government.  Arguing that a large public sector hinders entrepreneurial initiative and hurts competitiveness, the Rossello government embarked on a project of privatization in such areas as jails and school cafeterias; the training of new employees; and shipping, public transport, health, water, electrical, and telephone services.  It set out to sell government-operated hotels, convention centers, and agricultural enterprises.  Diverse models were employed: privatization of the management of agencies, subcontracting, outright sale of facilities, construction of private installations parallel to public facilities, private operation of toll bridges, and in the case of education, financial autonomy for schools and school vouchers.....  In a similar vein, Rossello tried to rewrite labor legislation, making it more flexible to employers' needs; to cut back the regulatory power of public agencies (such as the Department of Consumer Affairs); and to speed up the process of granting permits for building projects (the so-called fast track, thus making it more difficult for community or ecological groups to object or raise questions regarding them.

>The harm principle holds that the actions of individuals should only be limited to prevent harm to other individuals. John Stuart Mill articulated this principle in On Liberty, where he argued that, ""The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.""

I mean even if you go all the way down to the age 14/15 year old libertarianism contained in any of Ayn Rand's books this is copy-pasted nearly on every page.

The origin of capitalism came about through a series of highly violent unrelated events, central among them are the privatization of land throughout much of rural Europe and the atlantic slave trade.  My point is that none of these things have anything to do with the ""harm principle,"" but libertarians refuse to admit that.  In practice, libertarians are people who defend states that a) privatize public goods (violently if necessary), b) enforce currently existing property rights (with violence of course, i.e. jails), and c) do nothing to help poor people acquire property (b/c that would ""harm"" rich people).  The ""harm principle"" is disingenuous cover for those fundamentally violent policies.  It is not an accident that many libertarians speak highly of General Pinochet's coup in Chile.

Look, forget whatever history you're making up, and forget all the definitions of words you're changing and just think for a second.

(I do not mean to imply that I think property rights exist independent of the state; rather I believe they are created by states.)  Given that capitalism requires strong property rights, the harm principle is incompatible with capitalism.  The society that resulted from the actual application of the harm principle might be characterized as ""an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.""  That definition, by the way, is one of Karl Marx's definitions of communism (from the end of chapter 2 in the Manifesto).  There are various understandings of anarchism, and I suspect also, of social democracy that might be compatible with the harm principle.  These ideologies are, however, obviously not what is ordinarily meant by libertarianism, which is distinguished from these ideologies by its near absolute defense of property rights.  My point is that actually-existing-libertarians (not whatever libertarians are in your head) do not recognize that property rights are predicated on state violence that was and remains in excess of the harm principle.  Why they are incapable of recognizing this is an interesting question; I suspect it's generally because they are people from privileged backgrounds who have never thought seriously about the harm caused by private ownership of property.",1,0,1442419118,1444728690
