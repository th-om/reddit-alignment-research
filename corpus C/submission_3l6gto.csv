3l6gto,Do you feel the recent wave of meritless sexual discrimination lawsuits will hamper the feminist movement or discourage legitimate sexual discrimination lawsuits?,14,Huey_McDuck,"Recently there have been a wave of high profile sexual discrimination lawsuits that have been found to be meritless. 

Such as Ellen Pao (this is not anti-Pao circlejerk and I would love for people to keep their opinion of her work at Reddit out of the conversation), where she claimed that Kleiner Perkins discriminated against her due to her gender.  This was a case where many on the left, mostly feminists, proclaimed that this was a slam dunk and it represented women in professional settings.  After discovery, it came to light that she had grossly exaggerated her contributions to the firm and had several years of very low performance reviews with a material amount of personal conflicts with a large number of coworkers, subordinates, and managers. 

Or the recent Jefferies lawsuit, where a former female employee is suing the firm with the claim that she felt like a sex object (without naming specific events or dates) and that there were men only events, the only of which she could name was a ski trip with clients.  This lawsuit as well immediately sparked a wave of feminist groups proclaiming that this was another slam dunk.  It has come out already that the only event that she can point to, the ski trip, had its participants solely determined by the individual employee's clients being eligible & attending and her clients were never eligible.  


Do you feel that the recent wave of meritless high profile sexual discrimination lawsuits will hamper the feminist movement (or at least the perception of the movement) or discourage legitimate sexual discrimination lawsuits?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l6gto/do_you_feel_the_recent_wave_of_meritless_sexual/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442415973,1444727882
