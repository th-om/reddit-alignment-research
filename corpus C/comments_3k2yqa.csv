And this line of thinking is just stupid. As an employee, you are selling your labor to an employer, if you don't make enough money for the company to make up for what they are paying you, and then some, they won't give you a job.

If you are getting paied minimum wage, then your labor is literally worth less than minimum wage, unless you are getting exploited, then you should find another job, which in theory would not be to hard if you are producing much more than that.

I don't know how we could fix this though, probably mostly smoothing out these cliffs.

This is very true for skilled jobs, but not for unskilled jobs. Skilled workers have a huge variety of opportunities - including unskilled jobs. Not to mention a skill that employers are actually looking for. That means they have room to actually negotiate their wage and chose what they want to do and typically have a track record to prove their worth.

Unskilled, minimum wage workers do not have this luxury to ""sell"" their labor. If they don't accept whatever minimum level a company will abuse them for, companies will simply look for others. Minimum wage laws are specifically designed to prevent employers from abuse employees simply on the basis that someone less fortunate will be more desperate.

It's the same reason why a variety of salaried positions do not have overtime laws, but hourly positions do.

> If you are getting paied minimum wage, then your labor is literally worth less than minimum wage, unless you are getting exploited, then you should find another job, which in theory would not be to hard if you are producing much more than that.

Except for the fact that unskilled, uneducated people simply do not always have the luxury of ""finding another job"". They don't have the ability to ""get ahead in life"" or sometimes even to take time off to actually interview for another job, let alone leave a job to find another one soon. They have and always have had less wiggle room in their finances, meaning some become almost endured to their job on the sole basis they cannot afford to switch jobs.

> I am starting to think that the entire $15 wage debate is just dumb collage kids who studied bad majors and don't want to work for real, but are fine with being fry chefs the rest of their life and want more money for less work.

cuuib10,0,t1_cuugyh5,slccsoccer28,"I'm pretty conflicted on this topic. On one side, I see the issue of small business - a change like this might impact an already slim bottom line. One thing that I see getting overlooked in every conversation is this change will not be overnight - or likely even within a 2-5 year span. It will happen over a long enough time for businesses to adjust.

Similarly, I think the type of jobs that are currently paid minimum wage are paid that rightfully. They are completely unskilled and, in my opinion, are not career jobs like people are making them out to be. I am sorry that some people struggle as grill boys at McDonald's their whole life, but frankly McDonald's shouldn't be a career plan.

Instead of artificially raising wages to add incentive to lower skilled jobs, I'd much rather see an emphasis put on enabling low-skilled workers to become trained and educated to hold better positions via affordable or free options. Perhaps, even with an artificial raise in minimum wages - but not to the $15/hour level. 

Personally, I think this would be a better option as a whole. It would be more difficult to implement but it would encourage people to actually improve their skill set rather than dropping our standards to make the bottom happy. One factor I'm not certain about is if their are actually skilled positions to fill. I believe there are, but I could be wrong. If there are positions to fill, eventually minimum wage jobs would need to raise there pay to compete.

This opinion is based on the fact that I have never felt minimum wage jobs have been meant as a means to continuously support anybody more than a single individual. I have little to no empathy for parents who have 1 or more children and struggle to survive on minimum wage job (I do have significant empathy for the children).

This doesn't even count on the fact that a good percentage of minimum wage workers are extremely unreliable and can barely be counted on to perform simple tasks. I'm not saying minimum wage workers are all terrible (there are certainly very hard-working minimum wage makers), but there appears to be a higher percentage of bad apples compared to higher-skilled jobs (remember, part of being paid higher is the fact that you are more reliable). In my opinion, raising minimum wage to $15/hour, is only going to encourage a drop in quality for completely terrible workers.



That being said, I do completely understand the other side of the argument. Minimum wage jobs do seem to be the only types of jobs offered to a wide range of people. It does seem like such a large portion of jobs are now minimum wage, that there isn't a need for places to offer anything beyond minimum wage.  Even for those looking to work hard and advance themselves, the opportunities simply aren't there. How can we expect these types of individuals to support themselves if they simply do not have any way of doing so. A higher wage, does seem like an effective way to do this (although, I would really like to see it done in differently than simply raising salaries).

This certainly isn't as detailed as my previous points, but I think it's such an important issue that in my mind, it could be the sole argument for a higher wage. People being able to raise themselves (and perhaps a child) takes a lot of burden off current social programs and has a variety of cascading, positive effects (in particular it seems to reduce the level of crime). It's also extremely hard to look at this issue from a moral or humanitarian perspective and not think ""wow, not being able to support yourself is totally messed up, perhaps, we have a responsibility to ensure even the lowest of the low can get by"".

At the end of the day, I think better wages are beneficial but I think $15 is too high. I think a number in the $11-12/hour range in combination with an increase in benefits would be much better. I'd much rather see people on a better wage, but also receiving benefits from their employer like health, dental, vision, etc. It wouldn't have to be same as what a full-time, salaried employe has (which could cost $10k+/year), but it should be enough to ensure individuals can take care of their health. After all, employers do have a responsibility to ensure their workers have the ability to remain healthy and continue working.

One alternative I could see as useful is a progressive ""tax"" on minimum income jobs. Essentially, under a certain point (like $15/hour) companies would be charged a small fee for minimum wage jobs. Perhaps at minimum wage, this would be like $1/hour slide to $0/hour at $15. The fee/tax would be invested in helping low-skill, low-income workers support and advance themselves. Essentially, this type of system would be saying, creating jobs is great, but if you're not going to pay your workers a livable wage, you need to help amend your debt.",7,0,1441727389,1444731682

They only go up to the level of getting employees off of food stamps so they only take the minimum wage up to $13 and not $15, but they show that this increase would cost Walmart $4.8 billion each year.  They then calculate the price increase required on their products.  It would be 1.8% or almost 2 cents on the dollar.  Most consumers wouldn't ever notice, unless they're extreme couponers.  But considering the minimum wage increase I bet no one would mind.

WalMart is a bad example becuase they have so much sheer volume of product in comparison to their employees.  They can spread that pay increase so finely into their prices that most peole wouldn't notice.

[People have done the math for Fast Food places going to $15 an hour](http://americablog.com/2015/07/a-15-minimum-wage-for-fast-food-workers-would-raise-the-price-of-a-big-mac-by-17-cents.html) and calculated the price increases at 4.7%.  Meaning Big Macs would cost $0.17 more and dollar menu items would have to become $1.05 items.

Now if their suppliers aren't paying minimum wage, that could increases prices on each item another small percentage amount, depending on the difference, but still small enough that employees going from $8 to $15 will suddenly not be able to afford things.

The optimal minimum wage is equilibrium point where the negative welfare effects of disemployment cross the positive welfare effects of increased income. It has nothing to do with the cost of living, the morals we place on wages or indeed anything that has anything to do with individual need.

As the MW grows so does its disemployment effects, the higher wage floor reduces demand for labor at (and near) the floor. Without other effects this would result in any MW having a net negative welfare effect, lifetime earnings for the MW group would fall as it would become harder for them to find work even though that work pays more then they would achieve absent a floor.

The most significant of the other effects which allows for moderate increases of the MW to not create disemployment effects is that raises in the MW reduce turnover and thus labor costs (AKA efficiency wage), for most MW employers these costs are significant (not just searching but HCD in general, even unskilled labor still requires training). A MW increase which doesn't cause net labor costs to increase (EG cost of additional wage < savings from reduced turnover) will not create disemployment effects. The recent Walmart national increase was this in action, retail has the highest turnover rate in history and even with unemployment still persisting in many areas of the country Walmart were unable to fill positions (people preferred to be unemployed then work MW at Walmart).

Optimal MW is the point at which additional wage == savings from reduced turnover.

Dube recently used median income (simple distributional analysis, the higher median income adjusted for regional prices the smaller the MW labor force is and thus the higher optimal wage) to calculate this [on a metro & state basis](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/06/19_hamilton_policies_addressing_poverty/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf), as a policy paper to get the conversation going its very useful but we could build a far more accurate model then simply a function of median income.

They *are*. It just so happens that US unions aren't competitive because the biggest unions render them toothless. Exclusive representation prevents other unions and non union workers from competing properly.

Ironically being forced to pay non union workers the same is *how right to work laws in the US work*, yet pro-union people in the US decry them.

Really, I feel like this whole thing comes down to supply-side vs demand-side economics. Do we try to make the labor supply cheaper, or do we try to increase demand for labor? And the answer's pretty obvious, when you look at how businesses' operating expenses break down. Labor costs are only about 15% of the operating expenses of most retail and non-professional-certification service businesses. They're the smallest class of expense. Generally, if the business is healthy, *you can afford to hire people.* You can't go crazy, of course, but you hire the right number of people to do the job, you don't just hire people because you can. Making it cheaper to employ people isn't going to help, because they're already the cheapest part of the equation.

Instead, you need to increase demand. Improve the economy. Create opportunities for businesses to meet, and they'll hire more people as they grow to meet them. And the best way of doing that? Making sure people have more disposable income. Make sure the people living paycheck to paycheck have a little to spend on something frivolous instead of worrying about whether to pay the electric or the water bill this month.

> In the end there will be no difference either way, if it goes up poor people will make a little more money and then their rent will go up and they will still be poor, landlords and banks will get the difference.

And I can spend that extra 2% on stuff that makes my life better, and if me and 100 other people are doing that, maybe we can sustain another new business or two around us.

For one there's more to supply side economics than making labor cheaper. It's about making *production* cheaper, which includes lower overheads, lower transport tariffs, etc.

For two there's a difference between the costs for labor in wages and cost for labor total. Turnover, training, taxes paid by the employer, etc all come into the cost of labor.

For three businesses operate on small margins, so making labor cheaper will also bring down the cost of goods produced.

>Instead, you need to increase demand. Improve the economy. Create opportunities for businesses to meet, and they'll hire more people as they grow to meet them. And the best way of doing that?

I'm curious where you get your numbers as a) they are off significantly, and b) the real outliers not adjusted for are due to the federal poverty line, which doesn't account for cost of living.

Full time at the federal minimum wage is 15,080, unless you have 2 weeks off then it's 14,500.

What I'm saying is as a franchise owner (or boss) that relies on employees to work important positions for their business, should pay said employees a good living wage.

Why is a cashier or a fry cook so important?: 
McDonalds without a means to take orders and cook food is worthless.

Those people make the business. Without cashiers and cooks McDonalds would have to be a completely different thing than it is now.

Admin types (managers, accountants, HR, any other back of house thing I missed) also do great things to keep the business rolling, and should also make a fair living.

This assumes zero change in material cost, which by the way will be affected by the wages of those producing and transporting the materials. It also assumes the elasticity of demand isn't a factor, and the margins for productivity of workers versus wages won't change.

You simply cannot look at total sales and total wages paid and determine how much prices would have to increase. 

>Not in a world where their competitors aren't also increasing their wages. That's why you need to force everyone to do it so that the natural inclinations of capitalism for driving the least of us into poverty can be held in check.

Except businesses can collude right?

So which is it, are businesses colluding, or are they competing?

You know what increases bargaining power of workers without distorting the market? Increasing competition *for* workers, by increasing competition among employers.

As an added bonus this increases the bargaining power of consumers. Ironically this would require reducing barriers to entry, which means reducing regulations, the very thing you think is a force to help achieve these results. Unfortunately this is based on confusing intentions and results, and regulatory capture is a thing, and is more of a thing the more regulatory power there is to capture. When legislators can decide who can buy what, the first to be bought are the legislators.


It may seem counterintuitive, but if you want to help more workers, you have to actually have capitalism itself work. Your policy prescriptions just creates crony capitalism. 

Corporations can only become rich by either theft, fraud, or providing what people demand. Outside of theft or fraud-or employing the government to do it for them-a freer, less distorted market is the best way to prosperity for all (and yes fraud/theft distort the market as well).

No one has ever said that there is a no point where it's too high.  There's a reason that people call it a ""livable wage"" the idea is to allow people to not have to work more than two jobs to stay out of poverty.  No one wants to get them to into the middle class with this.  

> This assumes zero change in material cost, which by the way will be affected by the wages of those producing and transporting the materials.

Yes they do, and I said that in the next paragraph, which I guess you didn't read.  #1 those materials are still on a per product basis, so it will still be a thin layered increase across the board.  #2 manufacturing and transportation workers are already paid more than $15 for the most part, so the minimum wage isn't going to affect the supply chain as much as it does at the very front end service level, where snowballing effects will be minimal.

> So which is it, are businesses colluding, or are they competing?

I didn't realize that it could only be one.  I can assure you that it's both.  And they collude with the government as well.  And they try to game the government too.  It's complex and there's no easy answers.

I agree that we should be looking at how regulations former through the collusion of powerful corporations are negatively impacting smaller businesses.  We should be looking at ways to allow the market to work in the ways that it works best.

Increasing wages isn't one of those ways.  Protecting the environment by spending more money on waste disposal isn't one of those ways.

> You seem to misunderstand what the natural inclinations of capitalism and government are. 

We've all seen the natural inclinations.  Growth at all costs, no inclination to protect low skill workers or the environments, wages as low as possible for the least important and high as possible for the most important and paying governments as little as possible while using their services as much as possible.

All of these things have produced amazing amounts of technologies and entertainment.  They've also wreaked a lot of environmental havoc and ruined many lives.  

It's hard to argue that the time of least government control, and our market at its most unregulated at the start of the industrial revolution was very good for the common man.  They used the labor of millions to build cities and railroads only to funnel the wealth of that labor to themselves.  Then after the crash and with the rise of the unions we finally saw workers demanding their rights.  This is the first time that we really saw an explosive growth in the middle class and the lowest inequality since the robber baron days.

And we've seen the inclinations of the capitalists to destroy these worker institutions and protections and entitlements.  And we've seen since the 70's and 80's their successes in destroying and twisting those institutions, and reclaiming the lions share of the wealth.

They did it without all the regulations.  And you're right, now they use those regulations to their advantage.  That's not an argument against regulations and guidelines for markets.  It's an argument against crony capitalism.  We on the left want the same as you guys on the right.

I would love to see capitalism work at its best when it's not rigged by lobbying and government corruption.  I would also like to ensure that any workers left behind in that system are ensured healthcare and an ability to feed itself.

The industrial revolutions reduced poverty to a greater degree than any other period, so I don't agree.

Inequality is irrelevant. What matters is how much people have and how far it goes, and what is problematic is absolute poverty which is independent of income inequality.

>And we've seen the inclinations of the capitalists to destroy these worker institutions and protections and entitlements. And we've seen since the 70's and 80's their successes in destroying and twisting those institutions, and reclaiming the lions share of the wealth.

Not really. Other developed countries don't have limits on contributions and/or spending, yet we don't see the same corruption. Instead we see more legislators per capita, more local governance, and parliamentary systems that create more turnover. Some of them like Denmark and Australia actually have freer markets and better business environments as well.

All of these things diffuse power and make it less worthwhile to secure the loyalty of a given candidate, as each candidate has less influence and will not be around as long.

cuujrwt,0,t1_cuuhi42,TracyMorganFreeman,"> Yeah, that's the thing... with as few Fortune 500 companies as there are, and as few people deemed to have sufficient executive experience as there are, that's market failure. The market will not find optimal prices, it'll just provide random guesses with incentives toward guessing higher and higher. We're in a CEO bubble, and that's a problem.

Based on what? Scary big numbers with zero context?

No it's who *owns* the capital bears the risk, which is the stockholders, who happen to be choosing the CEO. 

They're still bearing the risk.
Their pay amounts to a few cents per hour less per worker in each company.",1,0,1441729741,1444731734

Almost none of the ""risk"" is on the laborers.  If the business goes down, they only lose future money (and lose the requirement of being there as well), and while that's a loss, it's not really a risk as they aren't betting anything to gain anything.  The shareholders are the ones risking their money.  You're right that the CEO isn't risking anything, but then they're an employee, and we typically don't require our employees to risk anything.",2,0,1441732992,1444731734

Hiring an employee is a risk.

When you hire an employee there is no guarantee that they will be worth the wage you are paying them; that they will fit in with the company culture; that they won't leave of their own volition after their training or probationary period is up. Those protections and requirements come at a big cost. Companies, large and small, are not going to be pre-disoposed to higher chancy people in today's economy because the costs of floating a non-productive employee are incredibly high. That factor's into a decision to higher somebody and in my opinion its one of the reasons that lower income people have such a hard time advancing - employers arent willing to take risks on these people because the odds are good that they won't work out.",1,0,1441739700,1444731734

That's sort of how the market works...

What about a minimum wage proportional to the availability of the specific labor required, which also takes into consideration the cost of living in the area, which also is mindful of the relative difficulty of gaining the skills required for the job?

The bottom line is that not many people (outside of high school, or no high-school diploma) make minimum wage *anyways*, and raising minimum wage is in no way good for the economy.
