3kkufl,Can we talk about the Jeb! interview on Colbert?,52,Im_on_an_upboat,"I can't find any video of this, but one of the weirdest things to happen on his appearance was the fact that there was NO applause when he came on stage. I know it's a tough crowd, but I have never seen a GOP candidate get zero applause when appearing on a late night talk show. It was so awkward and quiet. 

The interview itself wasn't terrible, but he didn't really win the crowd at any point. What does that mean for him? Is he really that disliked, even amongst the GOP? Tanking on a softball interview, does this spell future trouble or I am just prognosticating too far considering how early we are in the election cycle? Thoughts for anyone else who saw his appearance?",30,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kkufl/can_we_talk_about_the_jeb_interview_on_colbert/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441999081,1444729994
