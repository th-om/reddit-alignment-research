cvawmy1,1,t3_3lyyv5,kulturkampf,"I actually really like the War Podcast feed which is a curated collection of Australian Broadcasting Corporation's various politics / international politics hosts that provide feedback and commentary on issues pertaining to war. Other issues that are vaguely related to war also come up frequently. 

The analysis is great and the range of events covered are quite excellent.

cvakzt8,1,t3_3lyyv5,HeyZeusCreaseToast,"I listen to Dan Carlin's Common Sense as well and enjoy Slate's Political Gabfest and Ken Rudin's Political Junkie.

Slate has a panel of three regular hosts that discuss current events within the political world - leans left - but one of the hosts is a former constitutional lawyer, another is the host of Face the Nation, and I forget the background of the third host.

Ken Rudin has three segments, one devoted to a current ""smaller"" topic, the next topic is usually on a broader/bigger picture issue topic, and the third is a historic topic that he usually does a good job of tying back to current times. He has a lot of great, big name guests from both sides of the aisle, and in general does a good job of being neutral/non-partisan. Be prepared for bad jokes and even worse puns!",4,0,1442953297,1444725252
cvat5ng,0,t1_cvakzt8,iliveintexas,"> Slate's Political Gabfest

I started listening to this recently, and I've been rather disappointed so far. Most of the show seems like single-minded liberals, with rarely any decent conservative perspective offered. I lean Left, and I'm annoyed by how Left the show is.

The whole show feels like a conversation you'd have at a wine and cheese soirÃ©e hosted by your East Coast hipster friend, whose side hobby is leather work and who spends way too much time watching silent movies.",1,0,1442966665,1444725252
