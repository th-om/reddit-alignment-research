3m4vlx,Should the US get rid of carried interest?,17,Nonsanguinity,"By way of background, here is the definition from wiki:

>Carried interest or carry, in finance, specifically in alternative investments (i.e., private equity and hedge funds), is a share of the profits of an investment or investment fund that is paid to the investment manager in excess of the amount that the manager contributes to the partnership. As a practical matter, it is a form of performance fee that rewards the manager for enhancing performance.

>In private equity, the distribution of carried interest is directed by a distribution waterfall : in order to receive carried interest, the manager must first return all capital contributed by the investors, and, in certain cases, a previously agreed-upon rate of return (the ""hurdle rate"" or ""preferred return"") to investors. Private equity funds distribute carried interest to the manager only upon a successful exit from an investment, which may take years. The customary hurdle rate in private equity is 7â€“8% per annum.

>In a hedge fund environment, carried interest is usually referred to as a ""performance fee"". Hedge funds, because they invest in liquid investments, are often able to pay carried interest annually if the fund has generated a profit for its investors.

Recently, CI has gotten a lot of attention because both establishment candidates on the left and right (Hillary and Jeb!) and populist candidates on the left and right (Bernie and the Don) support doing away with what they call a tax loophole. I can't think of many other things that cross populist-establishment and left-right lines like this

So, are they right?  Should hedge fund partners have what-amounts-to-their income taxed at the same rate as everyone else, or should they still be able to be taxed at the capital gains rate?
