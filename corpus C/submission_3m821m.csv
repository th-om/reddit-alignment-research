3m821m,"As a nation, we routinely decry ""Socialism"" both in name and action yet when ""Capitalism"" nearly sinks us we use socialism as a lifeboat. Let's discuss!",125,syncopator,"Obviously this relates to Sanders and his bid for the nomination/Presidency.  While the word ""socialist"" clearly retains a thick negative connotation, every policy that Sanders has proposed has precedent in the US.  We already have tax brackets graduated by income, Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, and government-sponsored college tuition assistance.

Socialism is also attacked with the charge of supporting government-owned means of production, even though Sanders has not said anything suggesting this is his plan.  Yet the bailouts during the 2008 crisis were in large part *exactly* that.
