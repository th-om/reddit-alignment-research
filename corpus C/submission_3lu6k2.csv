3lu6k2,Why I'm against free college at a federal level.,78,cipahs,"Because it will allow people the ability to choose their college major without thinking of future economic consequences of doing so. Everyone i know with loans who has graduated, but graduated with a STEM degree or a business (accounting/finance/IS) degree hasn't had problems paying their loans.

I have free college, living stipend, free books, healthcare but i also joined the military so it's not free i pay via my labor. Even with that coming from a broke family with four sibling and a single parent (father) who's a plumber i didn't have financial options.

So knowing at 18 what debt does to people i decided to join the army guard. Before you say ""well i dont want to get shot,"" then get a job doing Information Support Specialist (25B) or Intelligence analysis (35F). Free college, free healthcare, free books, around 800-1000 a month in living stipend (plus drill money) and it helps your resume. I know the sound of doing something you don't want to do or goes against some moralistic belief sounds terrible but stay with me here, the universe is indifferent.

I made an economic choice.

Then i still took out loans my first semester so i could afford to live in the dorms, i did that for networking (economic choice)

landed a bar back job through a friend took out a loan for the second semester to pay for fraternity dues, i joined a fraternity for networking (economic choice) and i like to party. Because of that i landed internship opportunities and also landed a weekend job as a bartender. 

I picked economics and finance as my major with a minor in philosophy. If it wasn't for my financial future i would've picked philosophy. I'm still in school and i already paid off those loans, i dumped my savings to do it but i wanted to before interest rates rise.


The reason it's gone up is government has decided to increase demand for higher education massively, via increased subsidies and in particular student loans; meanwhile, supply has not kept up, because non-profit universities get paid in prestige (understood as mathematical selectivity) and therefore have an objective self-interest in not growing; the for-profit sector has been designed by regulation such that it exists to vacuum up subsidies rather than provide valuable education; and the government sector hasn’t kept up with demand. So the government actually created the problem via subsidy, it's the same reason healthcare in our country is equally expensive. Primarily because government subsidy (and regulation that creates monopoly or better yet limits supply) hides the non inflated costs of services. These 'feel good' policies in effect end up making it worse for everyone.

One issue we have is colleges have expanded the amount of non essential classes one most take in the 100-200 level, this is due to the margin they make on, for example, core humanities class versus an engineering class. Core humanities requires a teacher who has no private sector opportunities and a classroom. Robotics requires lab equipment and a teacher that can get higher paid job in the private sector. Another is to force colleges around the United states to massively expand campuses, this would require zoning law adjustments and slue of other things. Also another possibility is to expand community colleges and allow without exception credit transfer from instate community colleges to other instate colleges that receive federal funding. Additionally we can end all involvement of the federal government in student loans. Instead shift funding to scholarships or grants for students who were honor roll students in highschool and those students who maintain a high GPA relative to their major. I know majors such as Material engineering have a lower GPA average than marketing. Since many students don't even complete college why grant the loans they may not pay back, or those students who major in subjects that how low economic demand. Why should the debt of the irresponsible be payed off by those who are responsible?


EDIT TLDR

I'm for college tuition pay based on merit, under a certian highschool GPA say 3.5 you'd only get assistance in going to trade schools or community college career programs (information systems, nursing etc). It would scale up from that.

Those who argue for ""An educated populace benefits us all"" theres so many free resources to educate oneself it's ridiculous. Hell i finished a paper doing an analysis of the Soviet Economic system then i use four hours still amped up on adderal just to study the history of The Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem.
