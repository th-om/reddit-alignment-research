cvo13ya,1,t3_3nh47s,scithion,"Arms give people equality. They don't require strength or numbers to bring a violent situation to a draw. The lack of arms puts people at the mercy of groups of beaters, bullies, robbers and people with knives - situations where a person is unambiguously in conflict with a whole society. I much prefer a situation where a person can obtain the ability to defend against large numbers of material offenders - such as a Ferguson store owner shooting rioters, a sort of event which occurred during LA Riots - than where they cannot, simply to ensure that they don't go killing innocent people. Your argument here would be more plausible under total surveillance and near-instant response, but the former violates many rights or right-like principles and the latter is something too few people would want to pay for.

>We can not predict every person's action, but we can limit their access to dangerous tools.

Using these events to justify gun control strikes me as facetious. Almost all of them have a clear, common cause: ostracism. It is not even clear that the shooters are generally being irrational. We can limit ostracism with positive interventions, and blaming the victims of ostracism for not recognizing the institutional rights and norms of people in a society that rejects them is madness; in a sense punishing them is outside the legitimate punitive reach of those institutions, even if the State aspires to include them. 

Also, all precautionary laws hold human freedoms at ransom to probability. While this may be necesssary by virtue of events that set perimeters on the powers of the state, as with building codes and with unrecoverable liabilities, the regulations that apply to buildings zero in on the point of danger. Gun limiting regulations rarely do that, and owning a gun is a victimless act. 

Gun restrictions may also require many further restrictions on material freedoms and privacy, such as those on 3D printer. Absent externalities such as pollution, I would like the privacy to do what I want in my own house, and in public without vicitms.

Lastly, notwithstanding that we should not pass arbitrarily powerful laws simply because they will save some human lives, I think your case falls flat on the facts, because [the majority of gun deaths](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/24/suicides-account-for-most-gun-deaths/) in the US are done in suicide, which should be a right of the individual.",13,0,1443984058,1444718922

And there is no way even now to catch a person that has the intention to commit a crime before purchasing one. So no, I feel safer removing guns from society.

The idea that OP thinks that semiautomatic weapons  aren't effective for defending a home is laughable, and the fact that OP thinks that hunting rifles aren't semiautomatic shows a general lack of knowledge.
