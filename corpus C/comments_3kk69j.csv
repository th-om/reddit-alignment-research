The main concern of ""money in politics"" revolves much more around outside money and the super PACs.

You solution won't do anything if Soros and the Koch's can still funnel billions into elections while still not giving directly to the candidate. 

So lets say we put your idea into practice. We give Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump each $10mm in monopoly money. They go putting around spending their monopoly money hosting town halls etc etc. 

meanwhile in the background, you have third parties paying for signs, stickers, making phone calls, printing adds, airing commercials and a whole host of things. 

I don't really have an issue when someone wants each candidate to play with the same amount of money.

Public's five-star hotel, catered meals, and staff, when he might not have a chance in hell of winning? 

If elections were publicly funded, I would run for President, city council, county commission, state legislature, and the Senate every single chance possible. You've basically made it free money. I'd rally here, campaign there, and basically enjoy a year-long vacation. Of course, I wouldn't really do any of this, but showing how it is so easy to abuse.

Our current system of SuperPACs and mega-donors isn't perfect, but I'll fight publicly funded elections tooth-and-nail.

Beyond that, it's difficult-to-impossible to figure out what ""fixed budget"" works in what context.  A House race costs more in New York City than it does in North Dakota.
