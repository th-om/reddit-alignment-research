They cross this line constantly with gun control and exploiting shooting of any sort. When that reporter and her camera man were killed, they were calling for gun control without even knowing if he had even passed a background check or who he was. Both sides exploit stories.

Yes. You realize that most of the situations that call for more gun control, more gun control short of outlawing all guns would have had no effect right?

It is for political gain when the suggested controls would not have prevented the event they are using to push for more control. For example, the shooting of the reporters, no law short of outlawing all guns would have had an effect, since he went through a background check, was not a felon or had a documented history of mental illness, and was not using a gun that could possibly be banned for being say an assault rifle. 

When the president of other democrats says more gun control is needed before knowing any of these facts, it is just for political gain and to exploit a tragedy.

> But even I find it much less than cool that the GOP keeps exploiting terrorist attacks on Americans in order to advance unrelated political agendas, e.g., using 9/11 to invade Iraq, using Benghazi to get at Hillary.

I agree with this except for the Hillary part. An ambassador died for the first time in 35 years. That is a big fucking deal.

Now to the part I agree with. The leaders of the US should value war or oil more than they do freedom. That is what is happening. The idea that a US citizen must compromise freedom for safety is a canard. There is a way to have privacy and freedom and safety all at the same time but all three must be valued more than oil, business interests, open immigration, and political correctness.",1,0,1443631550,1444721848
cviye7o,1,t3_3mxa6b,mcapello,">So what I'm wondering is: where does this come from? Is it mostly due to the scorched earth nature of modern partisan politics? Is there a greater degree of fanaticism in the GOP? Maybe I'm wrong but I don't see Democrats/liberals crossing lines like these. The only thing I can think of that would be worse would be actually killing Americans intentionally and then exploiting it.

You have to zoom out and see the bigger picture. The GOP doesn't simply use fear and lies with respect to terrorism to get votes. They use it for everything: fear of homosexuals, fear of immigrants, fear of womens' rights, fear of the poor, and so on. The entire Republican platform is based on exploiting fear.

Why?

The main reason is that the Republican platform is fully regressive. It's built on defending a mostly imaginary past that doesn't exist anymore and can't be returned to even if it did exist in the way it's imagined. On foreign policy, race, religion, climate, economics, you name it, the Republicans are mainly in the business of denying reality, mostly because the core of their constituents are older, geographically/culturally isolated people who are in denial about what the country has become and where it's headed. That's why the Republicans can't govern.

The Democrats aren't much better. The Democrats are mostly in the business of getting re-elected. When it comes to handling issues, they're willing to talk about the problems, but most of them are happy to leave it there. The only Democrats who seem to do anything are the ones who have been in the game long enough that taking risks and calling up political capital for the right causes doesn't endanger them. Most of them are happy to do nothing, though, which is almost as bad as denying reality itself. ",-4,0,1443586703,1444721848
