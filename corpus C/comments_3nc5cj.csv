cvmpz4m,1,t3_3nc5cj,Doctor_Worm,"Liberals believe in a collectivist interpretation of the Second Amendment -- that is, the idea that the right to bear arms is something held collectively by a ""well regulated militia"" that is necessary for the achievement or security of a free state.

With respect to your question, OP, a liberal/collectivist interpretation of the Second Amendment would protect gun ownership of the sort that is most likely to actually bring about the outcome you're referring to (an armed and well-regulated militia), and would only restrict gun ownership of the sort that has little to no bearing on that scenario (one dude with a rifle).

The Taliban is an Afghan-native organization, not a foreign force. They were literally the government of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, and they didn't need to overthrow the US, just to kick us off their land which has since been accomplished.

First of all, if the military tried to use tanks, jets, bombs, and other blunt tools to try and excise a rebellion the collateral damage would only drive more civilians to join the rebel movement.

You are not going to win a war by any one thing alone. The use of marksmen is and was coupled with other insurgent activities.

The U.S. Military doesn't even have a full auto option for the m16/m4s. These weapons are still extremely effective.

A quick google search found that American civilians bought between one and two billion dollars worth a year. Reloading is pretty prevalent and would probably increase in an insurgency. 

> The amount of ammunition needed for combat is staggering.

For the conventional force, this is true. For the insurgency, not so much. The insurgency doesn't require fire superiority as part of doctrine.

Because ""numerous"" is a vague term. Has there been a battle where marksmen on the winning side was the primary force of arms? Has there been a battle where the winners were mostly armed with rifles?


>A quick google search found that American civilians bought between one and two billion dollars worth a year. 

Which does not tell me how many bullets they have.

A soldier in battle fires hundreds of bullets a day. Reloading makes sense if you have absolutely no other options. 

>For the conventional force, this is true. For the insurgency, not so much. The insurgency doesn't require fire superiority as part of doctrine. 

Supply is still just as important. 

I mean you are right, a small underarmed force can hold out for ages. They can turn small sections on the country into disputed territory. But they are not going to win a revolution with that. Successful revolutions are not won by those insurgency forces, they are won when the insurgents then build a regular army to take on the government forces. The Taliban took power in Afghanistan with a regular army, not with guerrilla tactics. The Viet Cong did not defeat the ARVN, the NVA did.

Yes, but I think this cuts against the armed civilians more than the government. The government enjoys centralized control and has the resources to make shows of power (think armed battalions patroling streets), whereas a civilian rebellion is decentralized and disorganized, leaving its messaging inconsistent. Once even a small group of civilians engage in violence in the name of the rebellion the government will respond as if it's a war, sidelining any efforts of non-violent opposition. It's extremely convenient for the government to fight a political dispute with arms because it means they can ignore the legitimate grievances of the opposition; it's now a national security matter. The opposition is best off keeping the focus on their complaints.

Recall in 2011 we witnessed 4 revolutions in the Middle East. Two of them, in Tunisia and Egypt, were non-violent and unarmed, while the other two, in Syria and Libya, were armed revolutions. The unarmed revolutions succeeded within a month, because the complaints were legitimate and the government had no good answer to them. The armed revolutions took two years or more to resolve, with hundreds of thousands killed in the meantime.

When the Egyptian government used force on the protesters, the opposition drew in people previously not participating, because there's no justification for using violence on unarmed protesters. The fate of the regime was sealed, there was no option but to step down.

But in Libya and Syria the opposition was armed, giving the government an obvious and justified response: war. Non-participants don't see the government's use of force as unjustified, so they'll tend to stay out, or concerns about security and fear of the opposition may cause them to side with the government.

cvmppbp,1,t3_3nc5cj,spoofdaddy,"A lot of the issues of gun ownership in America comes from the fact that anyone can own a gun. Guns have a utility for many people, but I don't see any problem with individuals who have an abnormal psychology to be denied a gun. Additionally, I think it would also be helpful if people who owned large numbers of guns to be required to join a gun club. That way, they have to interact with other gun owners and that would hopefully lessen the chance of them doing a crazy thing in isolation (I am assuming most gun owners are not crazy, which is my experience)",2,0,1443879782,1444719879

You're making a huge assumption there that there's a significant overlap between the gun control movement and hard-left socialism/communism. I shall quote from [Karl Marx](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm):

>To be able forcefully and threateningly to oppose this party, whose betrayal of the workers will begin with the very first hour of victory, the workers must be armed and organized. The whole proletariat must be armed at once with muskets, rifles, cannon and ammunition, and the revival of the old-style citizens’ militia, directed against the workers, must be opposed. Where the formation of this militia cannot be prevented, the workers must try to organize themselves independently as a proletarian guard, with elected leaders and with their own elected general staff; they must try to place themselves not under the orders of the state authority but of the revolutionary local councils set up by the workers. Where the workers are employed by the state, they must arm and organize themselves into special corps with elected leaders, or as a part of the proletarian guard. Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary. The destruction of the bourgeois democrats’ influence over the workers, and the enforcement of conditions which will compromise the rule of bourgeois democracy, which is for the moment inevitable, and make it as difficult as possible – these are the main points which the proletariat and therefore the League must keep in mind during and after the approaching uprising.",1,0,1443928826,1444719883

cvmy5l3,1,t3_3nc5cj,BeardedDenim,"Part of what I have seen is that people are taking the 'right' to ownership as a separate component to the 'privilege'. 

As an American, I have the right to own a gun and defend my home, but as a citizen, I have the privilege to fill out the right paperwork, do the correct training, and should have to prove that I am of sound mind and body to continue the right in using my gun. That's my responsibility as a gun owner in a democratic society. If my household has members that do not meet that criteria, then as a responsible owner I should consider proper precautions or other security options. When those options are not taken as the owner, and disasters happen, the owner needs to be held just as responsible. On that same token, I need a guarantee that those options are available to all gun owners. Whether that is proper safe and locking options available at ease, or mental health options available for my children or other housemates, I need options to continue taking advantage of my 'right' as long as I have the 'privilege' to do so.
