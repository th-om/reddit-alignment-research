 We live in a world where countries like North Korea have been committing severe human rights violations for a substantial amount of time, yet the world does not take aggressive action to rescue the people in work camps, political prisoners etc. 

We live in a country and world where most of us want to be able to help anyone and everyone. Yet there are considerable numbers of Americans who need rescuing: 613,000+ homeless where at least 49,300 are homeless veterans - many are homeless because the US government/VA system failed them (the VA itself needs major reforms, but that would get this thread off topic)/ psychological trauma from war. Why is the US not helping its own before helping others. Is there action being taken by the US government to help its own, like homeless veterans, as aggressive as what the US does for refugee they take in? The American Homeless population is only one of many examples of those who need help in the US. There are also currently 12 to over 20 million illegal aliens currently in the US - why not help those who need it, surely there are at least 10,000 illegal aliens who are in desperate need of help. If they are already here, why not help them to jump start their lives and help cities that need a lifeline (read an article saying Syrian refugees would prove to be assets/ life lines for many US cities like Detroit).

It is understood that US accepts about 70,000 refugees a year; yet, the US has always kept a low cap on Syrian refugees. Why is this? And why are so many people concerned about admitting any amount of Syrian refugees altogether?  Is it because there is a higher risk of bringing in Syrians due to the possibility of a homeland security threat as many articles have mentioned? 

 Also, can someone explain the process of how one Syrian refugee is chosen over another to be admitted into the US, what will the US do for each refugee admitted, etc?
