3njjgc,Why should the US care about paying down the budget defect?,11,slam7211,"You hear politicians constantly compare government debt to personal debt when they explain why we need to pay off our debts, but the reality is that they are entirely different.

Individuals lose their ability to work, and reliably get money over their lifetimes. In short we retire. That means that at some point individuals will inevitably be unable to pay the interest payments on debt. On top of that individuals can lose their jobs pre retirement and have issues temporarily paying interest/fees.

Government on the other hand, short of the occasional meaningless shut down that always ends with a CR these days, or a revolution is basically forever. It also can always increase revenue to pay interest/fees on debt. In short it will never stop being able to pay off interest. Why should we care about paying it off at all?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3njjgc/why_should_the_us_care_about_paying_down_the/,PoliticalDiscussion,1444023469,1444718564
