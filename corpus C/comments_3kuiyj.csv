cv185f6,0,t1_cv0nnwd,Captainobvvious,On what basis do you conclude that things have changed so much that in four years it's no longer effective to poll demographics?,2,0,1442245293,1444729280
cv19yn3,0,t1_cv185f6,elcalrissian,"Um, a lot?

The BLM movement was not a thing 4 years ago, thats a pretty strong fact.",1,0,1442248171,1444729280
cv1afil,0,t1_cv19yn3,Captainobvvious,"You haven't demonstrated how the existence of the black lives matter ""movement"" has effected demographic polling in any way. 

Yes, BLM wasn't an issue four years ago but it really isn't an issue now. There's no reason to believe that demographic polling is suddenly irrelevant because of it. 

You seem to be trying to explain why you THINK it SHOULD be way you think it is but you're not making a case as to why that's actually true. ",1,0,1442248894,1444729280
cv1baqx,0,t1_cv1afil,elcalrissian,"Its hard to quantify changes in a group without results (ie the results in 2016 voting).

Its true current polling shows trends staying similar to 2012 figures, but other little things, like 'man on the street' interviews, show that the Media have not reached 'common' voters the way people like us Reddit commentators have been able to see changes.

The more recent 'street' interviews by BS supports show this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YXdOtVqhgE&feature=youtu.be",1,0,1442250250,1444729280

I guess the election will show if you're right or not but there is no reason to believe anything has changed. ",1,0,1442250323,1444729280

cv1a0p3,0,t1_cv0uiy2,elcalrissian,"That figure is among ONLY democratic candidates.

for you to ""prove"" anything about favorability, the questin needs to be ""Of ALL candidates, who do you favor?""

It will still be high, but not the 80% figure stated.


But thank you for providing the Gallup results, and not some hokey blog analyzing the Gallup poll.",1,0,1442248256,1444729280
cv0nms4,1,t3_3kuiyj,houinator,"More than any other racial demographic, African Americans vote as a bloc.  In 2012, 93% of the African American vote went to President Obama.

cv0n38u,1,t3_3kuiyj,Braver_Incident,"Except it isn't wrong.  Black people have faced racism for the past centuries, and only recently were /legally/ seen as equals to whites.  There are still social structures, people in power, and a society that alienate blacks from whites.  Blacks still primarily occupy prisons, the lower classes, the run down schools, the poor cities and communities, etc.  There is still oppression against them.

This alienation has given them a ""racial consciousness"" that makes them aware of their groups interests, goals, and creates a unity for them. They are absolutely a voting block.",4,0,1442191764,1444729280
