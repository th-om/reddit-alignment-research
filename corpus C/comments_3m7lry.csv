cvctx89,0,t1_cvcrw5c,Cycloptichornclown,">he's not the most radical person on the GOP

He doesn't share most of the common opinions of the GOP.   

It would be like a right-to-work, pro-life and devote Catholic, anti-white Democrat running. 

The GOP is much more diverse than the Democrats at the state level, such as governors, Lt. Governors, and state houses.  Unfortunately, Trump is a fairly open bigot and seems to be actively working to reverse that. His anti-hispanic statements are horrible, and even though he has identified as a Democrat 13 of the last 15 years (*including the most recent 4 years*), they will be attributed to the GOP as a whole. 

Trump has very inconsistent opinions on the issues, flip flopping by the day.  While this behavior doesn't make him a radical, it makes people more familiar with politics uncomfortable.  From broad tax policy (*sometimes he is in favor of flat taxes, other progressive*) to specific tax policy (*positions on 1030 exchanges and carried interest for example*) to claiming that higher incomes need to pay more taxes (*while he doesn't voluntarily pay more him and pays significant amounts to legally lower his tax burden*).   He wants leave free trade agreements and add tariffs to imports while claiming that this will make us more competitive (*other nations will just raise tariffs against us in return*), he proves he is clueless on economic issues. 

And it doesn't help that he is close to Hillary Clinton, all of which unfortunately adds to the myth that he is a false-flag candidate.  Again, he has identified as a Democrat 13 of the last 15 years (*including the most recent 4 years*).  

He isn't going to win the core of the GOP and continues to collapse as more people observe his antics and realize that he shouldn't be taken seriously. ",2,0,1443118839,1444724678

cvd8v42,0,t1_cvcnnia,Gonzzzo,"It's a big, big, big mistake to construe polls taking place 4-6 months away from the first actual primary as being indicative of political reality...especially the political reality of a general election when ***everybody*** is paying attention. Right now, a fraction of the country is paying any attention to politics, even less are answering political polls

In a nutshell, Trump's campaign quickly resulted in record breaking unpopularity with pretty much every demographic that isn't white people. The only outcome in the general election is a landslide against him

>wouldn't he be losing in the gop polls instead of being 1st?

a big part of his lead in the polls is due to the fact that theres 14 other candidates, the GOP voters who don't like him are splitting their support among several candidates.

It's as though the parties are competing in a ""who's the worst possible candidate we can find?"" contest. Few people hate Jeb Bush on his own merits. On the other hand, a lot of people hate him because of a who his brother is, and some hate him because of who his father is, and a small elite few hate him because of who his grandfather was.

One advantage of being widely hated is that you have name recognition. This early in the contest, before a lot of money has been spent, name recognition is an extremely important factor.
A lot of Americans have little to no idea who Jindal or O'Malley are.
Biden looks vaguely familar, but they don't know much about Cruz or that Mario guy. Later on, as a front runner emerges name recognition will increase for those who haven't dropped out.
And the people who hate Clinton and Trump still will.
