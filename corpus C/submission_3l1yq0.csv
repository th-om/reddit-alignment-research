3l1yq0,Why does no one mention the political feasibility of Bernie's plan?,61,ZenerDiod,"The economics of Bernie's proposals have been torn to shreds on this and other subreddits, but forget that, why do Democrats think that Bernie is going to be able to get Republicans to actually go along with it? Obama ran as a center-left candidate and had trouble getting alot of his center left ideas through. Bernie's running as socialist, so what chance does he getting anything through?

15 mw? Forget about

Tax on the stock market to pay for free college? Good one

Single payer healthcare after all the political capital Obama lost on Obamacare, when he had both chambers? Yeah right

Raising taxes on corporations and rich people? Obama had to fight tooth and nail just to let the bush tax cuts expire.

This is what I don't get about those on the left who support him, do they think Obama is stupid or comprised because he wasn't trying? The president has power to do very little in the country, its the congress that doles out the cash, and it doesn't look like Congress is going to have a blue supermajority for a while, and even when they did blue dogs were too scared to go along with Obama's far more less liberal proposals(a lot of them lost their job over Obamacare).
