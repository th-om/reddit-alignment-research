It may not be the answer you're looking for but US global preeminence (and yes the ""eternal war"" that comes with it) has produced the most peaceful era ever in all of human history. That's not hyperbole. 

http://ourworldindata.org/VisualHistoryOf/Violence/StaticImages/Wars-after-1946-State-Based-Battle-Death-Rate-By-Type.png

http://www.salon.com/2014/01/15/were_living_through_the_most_peaceful_era_in_human_history_%E2%80%94%C2%A0with_one_big_exception_partner/

The US serving as the World Police has dramatically reduced conflict and bloodshed around the globe. Even when we seriously fuck up (Vietnam, Iraq), the death and destruction we cause is far outweighed by the peace we bring through by being the sole global superpower. Major powers do not start wars anymore because of both MAD (mutually assured destruction) and out of fear of provoking the vastly superior US military. So yes there is conflict but they are comparatively small, guerrilla style campaigns that rarely fan out into the all out wars of the past. 

Just look at the casualty data.. these wars suffer dramatically less causalities. Yet (arguably) keep the world in peace and prosperity (compared to the rest of history which is nothing if not incredibly consistent with its knack for mass bloodshed).

There are so so so so so many things wrong in this argument you are making.

If the Netherlands imploded tomorrow, then we would see prices on oil go down slightly in the long run because there is less demand.

That map list..... do... do you understand how bases work? How the U.S. got a lot of them? How they benefit other countries? A lot of the bases the U.S. PAYS FOR or has a lease on for another 20-30 years from back in WW2. Only a handful of countries have a base in them that they don't want (Cuba and Venezuela anyways). The benefits for having a U.S. base outweigh the losses. We stamp out trouble that they ask for help on (You are welcome nations with pirate problems), we self sustain an area which provides economic benefit to the nearby region, and we literally do so much that small nations don't have to have armed forces! Several pacific nations ASKED us to put a base there after Great Britain left them. Plus, seen by France under De Gaulle, you can ask the U.S to leave and we will on good terms. It's simply that they choose not to.

Lets see: China supports North Korea (Which don't kid yourself, they are worse than the Saudis) and Russia supports Assad's regime in Syria (Which gas bombed his own people). The only reason the U.S. backs the Saudis is because they want to protect Israel and since Egypt fell apart there isn't anyone stable willing to help. 

I'm gonna completely ignore this one, it's happened for a while in spurts. It ain't from this, trust me. If it happened before 'Nam, then it can't stand with your argument.

Lol. Not invading other countries more? Russia has fought in 13 foreign conflicts since their rebirth. The U.S.? 12. 2 of those russian conflicts earned them a nice slice of land. None so for the U.S.

I like how you pulled the one death toll that is 8 times higher than the rest of the estimates. Probably because the most common estimate is lower than the amount of Iraqis killed by Saddam. I don't like the Iraq problem, but the U.S. atrocities committed were on a far lower scale than what would have happened without them.

But as soon as the USD lost its reserve status, the debt would skyrocket due to inflation and there would be no way to pay it, so therefore the U.S. couldn't keep borrowing/printing money to pay for services and its military. Hopefully the U.S is so crippled by this that the don't get dying power syndrome like the European powers did. ",2,0,1442404885,1444728014
cv3g728,0,t1_cv3dfa0,Oldschool1964,">I positively loathe the US government, endemic racism, neocons, the US law enforcement, income disparity, southern states, gun culture, consumer culture and absurd, positively insulting military presence world wide.

There's things I don't like about America, but I love her with all her faults. It's interesting though that you hate millions of people you don't know and never met (namely, southerners). If racism is wrong for hating someone based on a physical characteristic, how is your stance any different when you hate someone based on where they live? Sounds like you need to take a breather. 

It's also interesting you refer to yourself as ""European"". I certainly would never refer to myself as ""North American"". I'm a proud American, which has become a rarity on Reddit, but there are those of us out there who are proud of our nation.

European countries have their own problems to deal with, so maybe you should spend more energy making your own country a better place than lamenting the downfall of my country. ",5,0,1442410497,1444728014
