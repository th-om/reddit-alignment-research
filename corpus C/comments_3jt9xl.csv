cus749g,0,t1_cus4vbb,elcalrissian,"> mortgage tax deduction

This is unrelated to Fannie Mae.  Fannie May 'insures' loans by promising to buy them if they get risky or default.  When the limit was for 'Moderate Risk' individuals, Fannie Mae operated well.  Banks didnt bet TOO much because they knew FM had a limit.

 - You see, if you've watched ""Its a Wonderful Life"", banks need cash on hand, or promised income (like from a debt repayment) to allow itself to offer loans for more Homes, businesses, or investments.  If a bank sees that cashflow stopping (from people not paying debt), their ability to loan is lost.


With Clinton deciding to allow that 'Moderate' risk lower to 'High' risk, Banks gave out MORE mortgages.  This meant FM was going to, possibly, eat many bad loans, as High Risk are exactly that...high risk to pay back.

This is what caused the banking crisis in 2008-2009.  After a few years of these High Risk loans, and after a grace period many loans had before defualting (usually 5 years); the impact was Sudden.  In less than 10 years, the Mortgage Market crashed, as FM could no longer afford to back up those bad loans.  Banks ate the loss, and, like happened, stopped lending, as that cash flow was no longer accountable on their income sheets.


The mortgage interest deduction is a line item on a personal income tax return.  The interest has already been paid by the borrower, and, Since the Borrower is paying income taxes as well, the IRS gave home owners incentive to have a mortgage, allowing the money they already paid be deducted from their overall Taxable income.  

 - Very Important:  People who DID NOT pay their mortgage payments CANNOT deduct interest from their income, as they did not pay any mortgage interest.  This is FORM-1098 for the IRS, and is issued by the bank you're paying your loan to.  If you dont pay any interest, the 1098 comes back with Interest Paid: $0.  Deducting a phantom number, if no mortgage loan payments were made, is illegal.

cusfhz6,1,t3_3jt9xl,passionlessDrone,"> Do you disagree that the economic downturn happened because of the 'Sub Prime Lending Crisis'?

Well, we might instead disagree that the sub prime lending crisis had a singular cause, and instead, was comprised of lots of things going wrong over time.  Jesus Christ, you link to Wikipedia, and ask people to Google it, but you don't seem to know the first goddamn thing about it.  

From your link: 

> **There were many causes of the crisis**, with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions, regulators, credit agencies, government housing policies, and consumers, among others.[5] A proximate cause was the rise in subprime lending. **The percentage of lower-quality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8% or lower range to approximately 20% from 2004 to 2006**, with much higher ratios in some parts of the U.S.[6][7] **A high percentage of these subprime mortgages, over 90% in 2006 for example, were adjustable-rate mortgages.**[4] These two changes were part of a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higher-risk mortgage products.[4][8] Further, U.S. households had become increasingly indebted, with the ratio of debt to disposable personal income rising from 77% in 1990 to 127% at the end of 2007, much of this increase mortgage-related.[9]

How do you propose that Clinton was responsible for an increase in sub prime lending from 2004 - 2006?   How was Clinton responsible for an explosion in the rates of variable rate loans in the mid 2000s?  

> From 2000 to 2007, one of the largest agencies—Moody's -- rated nearly 45,000 mortgage-related securities[201]—more than half of those it rated—as triple-A.[202] By December 2008, there were over $11 trillion structured finance securities outstanding in the U.S. bond market debt.[201] But as the boom matured, mortgage underwriting standards deteriorated. **By 2007 an estimated $3.2 trillion in loans were made to homebuyers and owners with bad credit and undocumented incomes, bundled into MBSs and CDOs, and given top ratings[203] to appeal to global investors.**

I'm curious on your thoughts on how Clinton was responsible for a the pile-of-horseshit ratings on these financial securities?  

> As these mortgages began to default, the three agencies were compelled to go back and redo their ratings. Between autumn of 2007 and the middle of 2008, agencies downgraded nearly $2 trillion in MBS tranches.[204]n** By the end of 2008, 80% of the CDOs by value[205] rated ""triple-A"" were downgraded to junk.**[206] [207] Bank writedowns and losses on these investments totaled $523 billion.[203][208][209]

Do you think this played any part in the crisis?  If so, how did Clinton cause it?  If not, why not?  

Also from your article:

> Some analysts believe the subprime mortgage crisis was due, in part, to a 2004 decision of the SEC that affected 5 large investment banks. The critics believe that changes in the capital reserve calculation rules enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on, fueling the growth in mortgage-backed securities supporting subprime mortgages. These banks dramatically increased their risk taking from 2003 to 2007. By the end of 2007, the largest five U.S. investment banks had over $4 trillion in debt with high ratios of debt to equity, meaning only a small decline in the value of their assets would render them insolvent.[232][233] 

What is your evidence that Clinton was responsible for a drastic change in big bank portfolios in from 2003 - 2007?  Do you have  NYT article from 1987 to make that point?

> A contributing factor to the rise in house prices was the Federal Reserve's lowering of interest rates early in the decade. From 2000 to 2003, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 6.5% to 1.0%.[285] This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot-com bubble and of the September 2001 terrorist attacks, and to combat the perceived risk of deflation.[282]

Housing exploded partly as a function of extremely attractive interest rates; did Clinton somehow reduce the target rate fro 6.5 to 1% from out of office?  How?

In regard to weakening of EPA/FDA area regulation I'd say that Medicare Part D prohibiting the government from negotiating with drug co.'s on prices was pretty extreme as far as 'getting gov out of the way' goes.

He is a good example of going beyond deregulation to actually help industry by abusing Federal preemption powers to ax state jurisdiction and filing amicus briefs in favor of drug co's during his tenure.

I will cede that FDA dereg wasn't that bad, at least compared to EPA's castration. Even in the last days of the Bush Admin there was some [serious dereg](http://www.propublica.org/article/bush-forces-deregulation-in-waning-days-of-administration) like EPA ruling exemption 1.5 mln tons of hazardous solid waste from being treated as such and allowing ""confined animal feeding operations to **voluntarily** apply for permits to discharge waste into waterways"". And long before that was exempting 'fracking' and its fluids from the Safe Drinking Water Act and not letting the fluids be labeled as pollutants under the Clean Water Act to exclude fracking from special EPA oversight and specified that the chemicals used in the process were not to be labeled as pollutants under the Clean Water Act. This was done as part of the 05 Energy Policy Act (see sec 322). The act also exempted oil and gas building activities ""including roads, drill pads, pipeline corridors, refineries, and compressor stations from having to obtain a permit controlling polluted stormwater runoff caused by construction activities, as previously required under the Clean Water Act"" (Sec. 323)quoted text from [Nat Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/295819/cheneys-energy-success-nash-keune).

Massive expansions of the welfare state are not reductions in regulation.  

>He is a good example of going beyond deregulation

there is no de-regulation here. Troy was imposing federal regulatory authority over formerly state matters.  That's an increase in federal regulation.  

>Even in the last days of the Bush Admin there was some serious dereg like EPA ruling exemption 1.5 mln tons of hazardous solid waste from being treated as such 

All of the examples listed in that article are INCREASES in regulation.  Every single one is a new rule that is weaker, in some way, than what was either originally proposed or desired by someone, somewhere.  As I said, environmental groups often call rule increases ""de-regulation"" when the new rule is not as strong as they like.  that does not make it so.

THe same is true of fracking.  The bush administration did not weaken rules on fracking, they simply did not create new rules as strong as some people would like.  that does not make them de-regulatory.

By stimulating spending and having the Fed (Volker) pull monetary supply concurrently Reagan was able to rein in the inflation and bring things into check. 

[A fairly good review of why Bush's plans didn't work](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/did-the-bush-tax-cuts-lead-to-economic-growth/).  Bush's recession was one of consumer OVERspending and had nothing to do with anything similar to Reagan's recession.  The market was correcting itself because where it was actually at was not where it should have been at.  People were taking out loans for everything, then when they couldn't afford the loans they were taking out loans to pay for their loans.  Cutting taxes didn't stimulate growth, it merely let people pay their bills which actually pushed more money up increasing income inequality.
