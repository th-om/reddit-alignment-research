cv196lk,1,t3_3kv6zb,zoidberg1339,"I am getting *really* tired of Sanders supporters making incredibly low effort posts that are nothing more than proselytizing.

I must say, I do find one thing about them pretty interesting. They always seem to assume that the overwhelming majority of this subreddit's subscribers are also Sanders supporters.

OP, have you never visited this sub before? There are people here - on the right *and* the left - that don't want Sanders anywhere *near* the White House. The /r/politics echo chamber has coddled Sanders supporters beyond belief.",5,0,1442246950,1444729268
cv0t8s0,1,t3_3kv6zb,panburger_partner,"If Bernie's elected, he'll still have to contend with congress.  Any progress will continue to be incremental, so it's not likely that he'd be able to make huge changes.  But still, if you think about the alternatives, it still might be better to have that.  And that's what democracy is supposed to be anyway, for better or for worse, so it's not just part of the voting population getting everything they want.",3,0,1442202853,1444729268

We aren't going to see a nationwide political revolution that goes very far left.

cv0tuhr,1,t3_3kv6zb,RadBadBlackBat,I understand what you are saying. But we will still have the opportunity to elect more officials to both Senate and the House who will represent more of our like ideas the corporates'. Besides that I think referendum is a viable option! You might say that will never happen but hey! what do you think the political revolution is about! It's about politicians hearing what people really say and what they really want. These are my thoughts!,-9,0,1442204125,1444729272
