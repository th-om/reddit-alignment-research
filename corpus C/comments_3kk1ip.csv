> To begin with, education is correlated with the tendency to think like an economist, which could be considered a centre-right characteristic (Caplan, 2001, Caplan, 2007 and Caplan and Miller, 2012). More importantly, intelligence itself is correlated with the tendency to think like an economist, at least in the United States (Caplan & Miller, 2010). For example, Americans with higher intelligence are less likely to agree with statements such as ""it is the government's responsibility to provide a job for everyone who wants one"", and ""corporations should pay more of their profits to workers and less to shareholders"". They are also less likely to agree with the statement, ""it is the government's responsibility to reduce the differences in income between people with high incomes and those with low incomes"" (Kanazawa, 2010). Furthermore, Rindermann, Flores-Mendoza, and Woodley (2012) analyzed data from Brazil, and found that mean IQ was highest among individuals who described themselves as centre-right. In addition, there is evidence that libertarians, who are more likely to vote for the Republican Party (Kirby & Boaz, 2010), have higher intelligence than both conservatives and progressives (Kemmelmeier, 2008 and Iyer et al., 2012). Finally, Republicans have better objective political knowledge than Democrats (Kohut, Doherty, Dimmock, & Keeter, 2012).

Of course, left wing ideologies can just as easily be hijacked by those who want something for nothing, just as right-wing can be hijacked by those who wish everything for something, but I think if you remove the human element and look at the ideal scenarios,  the idea of a more equal and cooperative society rather than one in which everyone is left to fend for themselves (or freedom when spun the other direction) is ""better,"" if there can be said to be such a thing.

To expand a little further.

Essentially the system we have now in most western countries. Industry and capital are privately owned, but must conform to government regulations on emissions, food safety, employee safety, etc. Pollution, illness, and accidents have a cost that isn't always directly reflected in a pure market system, so we use regulations to add a cost (like a carbon tax or a workmen's compensation fine) in order to correct that.",-1,0,1442005928,1444730054

Sorry, but it is.  Property rights are the backbone of a free and prosperous society.  

If you can't own the fruits of your labor and do whatever you'd like with it that doesn't infringe on others' natural rights, you aren't truly free, and there is no incentive to work, to create things, or be good stewards of the land/property.  

Without private property, there is no voluntary exchange, because there's no personal responsibility or skin in the game.

Most people regard the Liberals as a joke now. They spent the whole of New Labour arguing from the left, yet the moment they got into power their economic policy became almost identical to the Conservatives. It's hard to make people trust you after pulling shit like that.",5,0,1441991941,1444730062
cuya0o2,0,t1_cuy427f,BunniesWithRabies,"The 'Dems lost a whole load of votes because they became associated with government, and had a significant voter base who wanted a protest vote, but to a party with mostly credible policies. I think they'll gradually regain seats over the next few general election. There still isn't a truly good alternative for many people who don:t want to vote conservative/Labour, but see both Ukip and the Greens as demagogues. Though I do agree Corbyn would lessen Farron's appeal.

I think the Lib Dems get an unfair rep. They were significantly the lesser party, so often for somewhat steamrollered. Also whenever they tried to make a bold decision based of figures (e.g. the tuition fees thing) the got a massive backlash as people didn't care that they had tried to adjust their views as things were to costly, they merely accused them of being traitors. The policies they wanted and could deliver with some support and giving way from the Tories tended to be smaller and less high profile.

cuyb6g9,0,t1_cuya0o2,RationalRattachist,"It was amazing to see throughout the 5 year parliament how the lib Dems managed to ruin every part of their party that was considered appealing. Let's go through the list:

Tuition fees were raised even though all candidates signed a pledge to vote against them.

The UK went to war with Libya and bombed Iraq again despite the Lib Dem opposition to Iraq established them as the party with the best foreign policy.

Theresa May was allowed to be Home Secretary and pushed through more counter-terrorism bills despite the Liberals supposedly being against the surveillance state.

They couldn't get a referendum on Proportional Representation, and had a terrible AV campaign, despite PR being the flagship Liberal policy for years.

They couldn't get the House of Lords scrapped despite their commitment to democratization and constitutional reform.

They also had very little cabinet positions, so they couldn't have pride in, say, the education reforms because almost all major ministers were Tories.

The Lib Dems had very little major achievements to show for 5 years of coalition. I doubt they'll make any type of rapid recovery until the Conservatives get kicked out by a landslide, when voters will vote for the highest polling non Tory candidate. I'd put solid money that this will happen in 2025, but not 2020.",1,0,1442003229,1444730062
cuyd3a3,0,t1_cuyb6g9,BunniesWithRabies,"See I admire them most for the tuition fee position, though that is a controversial position. Any (minor) party that gets into power, looks at what they promised, and what, now they can see the breakdown of expenditure, can be afforded. Then they, when expressly told they could abstain, changed voting orientation to match what they now believed was the least worst option. Then they got pillored. I think that took real cojones.",2,0,1442006357,1444730062

If you make a promise, you should try to keep it (especially when you campaign on ""an end to broken promises""). As a junior partner in a coalition, getting rid of tuition fees would be impossible, but refusing to having them get raised should have been non-negotiable.",1,0,1442013674,1444730062
cuyxpt5,1,t3_3kk1ip,W0LF_JK,"Millennials are overwhelmingly liberal but even more so they are democratic socialists. With millennials slowly coming of voting age we will see a completely different political landscape. The biggest challenge is just getting the millennials to vote. Voter participation is the best representation of a countries general will. With only ~40% of voters even bothering to come to the polls (This is in the US and England) we don't have a representational government but a government imposed by the minority. 

Corbyn's election I think is a sign of things to come, from other democratic parties across the globe. Its time for a little progress.",1,0,1442063433,1444730062
