3l6drv,"Uneducated people and the use of the word ""Liberal""",18,0JSampson,"What is the reason for the use of the word ""liberal"" as if it is an insult? And why is it used almost exclusively by uneducated people who don't even know what it means? I mean, I consider myself fairly liberal but that is beside the point. You can't even have a nice debate with someone over the Internet anymore without them screaming ""you race baiting liberal"" at everyone that lays facts and common sense on them. I'm sure even educated republican voters are called ""Liberal"" when dealing with these people.
