cvghq3t,1,t3_3mnfck,jew_yorker,"Slate Political Gabfest is quite good. There are three co-hosts, two of whom (David Plotz & Emily Bazelon) are on the left. The third is John Dickerson, who is fairly objective.

As for Cenk & TYT, I like them in some respects, but they can grate on me. I used to watch them a lot more, but I've kind of stopped. They make a lot of errors that they shouldn't make and they have the habit of assuming that no intelligent well-meaning person can disagree. If you don't see things Cenk's way, it's because you're a bad person or because you're stupid. On 90% of issues, there is no other side. I honestly think they should hire someone who is intelligent and conservative. It would make the show ten times better.",10,0,1443407961,1444723129

I used to like Cenk Ugyr too, but TYT fell off the rails at some point. They became really SJW-esque. I saw them get certain issues wrong to a point where it was cringe worthy.",5,0,1443415212,1444723129

cvhf4kc,1,t3_3mnfck,MAGwastheSHIT,"I tend to lean left on most (but certainly not all) issues, but I often listen to right-wing talk-radio shows just to pass time and get my blood flowing while I yell at the radio while stuck in traffic.

The daily lineup on the dial, after the local morning show guy (who is also a hardcore right-winger who accused the local university Muslim student union of being a terrorist sleeper cell), is Glenn Beck, then Rush Limbaugh, then Sean Hannity, then Mark Levin.

Beck is sincerely insane. He's the only one of these demagogues who I think actually believes all the crazy shit that comes out of his mouth, like comparing Kim Davis or the bakers who refuse to serve gay customers to figures from the civil rights movement. He's also too preachy for my tastes.

Hannity is a dolt. 'Nuff said.

Levin is a nut too, of course, but his voice irritates me. He sounds like the stork from the Vlasic pickle commercials, except really angry and paranoid.

So to answer the question, I guess Rush Limbaugh is my favorite. He's a hyperpartisan hypocrite douchebag who blatantly lies every single day (listening to him talk about the Iran nuclear deal has been hilarious/infuriating), but he seems to have a good sense of humor and not take himself as seriously as the others.

cvgp7ne,0,t1_cvglieo,no-soy-de-escocia,"This makes me cringe. Savage is the most hateful, dangerous, and off-the-rails personality in mass media, whose presence on the public airwaves amounts to a betrayal of the public interest. He's a daily test for what constitutes hate speech. The only reason I can possibly contemplate you finding his show funny is that you don't realize how seriously his paradigms and opinions are taken by his fans. Hannity, Limbaugh, and Beck don't even come close to him. 

>his...ad hominems are at worst annoying and at best hilarious.

None of those three would hang up on a caller after telling him he's a sodomite pig who needs to ""get AIDS and die...you piece of garbage.""

To your other points, I find his voice annoyingly grating and ""orating skills"" impressive only if you consider bloviating and being able to endlessly spew nonsensical bullshit a ""talent.""
