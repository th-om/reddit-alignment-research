**It's pretty simple, it's because he's not part of the establishment, he doesn't share their views.**

They also see him as damaging the Republican brand, making it a laughing stock, they don't like him pointing out political corruption.

He doesn't need their money, he doesn't owe them anything, they can't control him.
They don't like them taking shots at establishment candidates, they really really don't like that he's beating all of their candidates.

But more importantly, he has no loyalty to the party whatsover. He doesn't know them, wasn't mentored by them, doesn't owe them any deference or favors. They can't do anything if (as their candidate) he completely ignores GOP policies and goals.

cvckr2d,1,t3_3m4cnr,nobody25864," Trump is a wild card. His positions are extremely inconsistent, he makes extremely wild and outrageous claims that can't possibly be fulfilled (see ""Mexico will pay for the wall""), and all his arguments basically break down to ""I'll get my way because I'm rich and charismatic"". The only thing that's certain about him is that he'll force whatever policy happens to randomly strike his fancy and will ignore any criticism.

The GOP Establishment doesn't like this because it hurts brand image and puts him beyond control. As much as I dislike the GOP establishment, I'm not looking for a charismatic dictator either :\",2,0,1443105338,1444724842

Trump is spoiling the plan by making their electable candidates look timid and forcing them way too far the right on immigration which pretty much guarantees a loss in the general election.
