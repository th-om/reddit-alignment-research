I understand its a very old issue but since its been at least a decade I figured it was worth bringing up again. Please no religious or partisan politics. 

TL;DR version: It is theorized that in the early 1990s, the sudden drop in crime rate was attributed to the Roe v. Wade. Namely, the first generation of high risk teenagers were never born. Fewer impoverished children had to grow up unwanted and/or orphaned and thus fewer turned to criminal lifestyles.
