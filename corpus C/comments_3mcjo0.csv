cve1yma,0,t1_cvdwrwe,LiveByTheFreePen,"I'd seriously argue for a semi-parliamentary system. 

And Congress could run on the German model. We would have one house elected proportionately in a national election to represent the people. The senate would go back to being chosen by the states, but it would be a much weaker body that can only vote to approve or block legislation written in the house. The senate delegations would also have some power to approve laws that specifically impact their constituencies. 

We could also have an EU-style fourth ""auditor"" branch of government, responsible for independently looking into fraud, waste, and abuse and enforcing civil rights laws within the government itself. 

We could replace the outmoded interstate/intrastate commerce idea with a spectrum of concurrent federal and state powers. Some would be 100% federal (monetary policy, intellectual property), or 80/20 (banking), or 50/50 (economic development), or 20/80 (agriculture, mining), or 100% state (property law, professional licensure, health code). 

We could have stronger privacy protections and an express right to autonomy, so that you could challenge a law in court and make the government defend it in terms of the public interest. ",5,0,1443207667,1444723698

cvdylsc,1,t3_3mcjo0,AuthorizedWayne,"No.

One strength of our system at this point is that the actual text of the Constitution is too old to be 'in play' in politics. We argue about the meaning of the text and about adding new amendments, but no one is seriously making an issue about whether the interstate commerce clause should be in the Constitution or not.

If you have a new constitutional convention, suddenly everything is on the table, everything is up for potential renegotiation. We'd see people trying to win political disputes by just getting their principle written in to the constitution.

Whatever came out of a new constitutional convention would be a controversial, polarizing political document. In 200 years time it might become as accepted as our current constitution, but only if it survives that long. Why should we throw away something that works?",3,0,1443202565,1444723698

The flip side is those walls also help protect the political powers that be from the people. The same walls that protect can also imprison.
