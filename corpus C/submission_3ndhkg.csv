3ndhkg,"Out of all 9 nuclear states, Britain seems to be the only country with a vocal campaign for nuclear disarmament. Why is that?",27,UKIPcampaignteam,"Polls tend to show a quarter of Britons support unilateral nuclear disarmament (and only half opposing) which is significantly higher that in any other nuclear state. When given the cost of Trident, most people oppose renewing it.

Why does the British left hate Britain having nuclear weapons more than other countries' lefts?

Why is nuclear disarmament somehow not an issue in the other 8 states?

Do you think it will ever become a mainstream position in the United States, or any other nuclear state?",37,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ndhkg/out_of_all_9_nuclear_states_britain_seems_to_be/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443900509,1444719555
