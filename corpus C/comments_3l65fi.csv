Lessig was a founder Creative Commons, Roostrikers, and Change Congress. he launched the Mayday PAC last year. he's been on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Free Software Foundation, MapLight, Software Freedom Law Center. he teaches law at Harvard, and is the director of the ethics center there.

Lessig was fucking dream parent of the open source and copy left movements. then he switched to dedicate his work on political corruption and getting money out of politics in 2007 and is fucking baller in that area as well. he is the most intelligent person running for president and has fucking incredible ethics.
