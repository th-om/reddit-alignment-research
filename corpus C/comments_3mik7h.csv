See, the problem is that by _banning_ abortions, you _force_ someone to give up their bodily autonomy. Their body is used by another being, without their consent. If you ban drugs, or ban selling body parts, you are not actually violating someone's bodily autonomy, as you are not forcing anything on them without their consent. You are taking away a possibility to do stuff, but that is not what bodily autonomy is about. 

I think your argument stems from a misunderstanding of bodily autonomy as ""I can do anything i want with my body"", instead of ""I have the right to decide what happens to my body"". Following your logic _literally everything_ should be legal. ""You should support someone's right to murder people!"" after all, it's their decision to decide what they do with their body, right? 

The only thing that you mention that is akin to the abortion/bodily autonomy situation is committing suicide, since by not allowing people to leave their existence if they feel like that you _force_ life upon them.

I guess that is the crux of the whole debate, and also why people frequently label pro-life activists as anti-sex. In the opinion of the pro-choice side (and my opinion) sex _does not_ equal consent to procreation, because sex does not necessarily have to be for procreation. In the, frankly completely outdated, opinion of some pro-lifers, sex necessarily entails procreation and therefore implies consent to procreation. 

There's no ""consent"" to let a fetus grow for 9 months when you have sex for the purpose of recreation. There's only ""consent"" when you have sex for the explicit purpose of procreation. When your actions can produce an onfortunate result that you didn't want them to have, especially when you took every measure of preventing that result (birth control, in this case), you do not consent to that result by taking the action.

This is a false analogy; it would be a bit more to say you don't ""consent"" to vomiting when you ""go to a bar and get drunk."" Pregnancy is the direct result of the parents' actions and theirs alone; the fetus does not place itself in the womb. 

Sex assumes an implicit possibility of pregnancy. Your body not reacting in the way you hoped it would does not absolve you of the consequences.

I don't see how this view is outdated. Sex has always been enjoyable. It has also always had the present potential for procreation. These are not new phenomena. Better sex education might be helpful in some places, which is sadly a view that some pro-life advocates oppose, but I am not among them.

cvfkf91,1,t3_3mik7h,xiipaoc,"> seemingly parallel positions

They aren't parallel at all.

What are the negative effects of abortion?  None, really.  They're actually all positive.  A woman aborts, and she doesn't have to put up with months of pregnancy, childbirth, etc.  An unwanted child is not brought into the world to be uncared for.  If there were health reasons for the abortion, the woman escapes possibly serious complications from the pregnancy.  One less unwanted child can often mean that a child is not born into poverty to a mother who can't adequately care for it.  The only problem with abortion is that some people are morally against it.  It's not so much that women should have bodily autonomy; it's that someone else's weird notions of morality shouldn't be a factor in her decision to terminate a pregnancy.

On the other hand, what are the effects of using drugs?  Well, for many drugs, you get addicted.  You get addicted, you stop doing everything else.  You stop doing everything else, you have no money.  You have no money, you commit crimes in order to buy the drugs.  That's a problem -- a big one.  People on drugs also make things less safe for everyone else.  Forget even the illegality.  Even if it were all legal, it would still be bad for me if you're a drug addict and live near me.  It's a public health nightmare.  So there's good reason there to ban drugs -- the only tiny little problem is that prohibition is a fucking abject failure.  It's absolutely terrible.  It doesn't stop the flow of drugs; it just creates a black market filled with violence.  Drugs *are* a problem -- some of them, anyway -- but the current strategy of pushing drug purveyors underground instead of treating drug abuse as a medical problem (and providing affordable medical care, obviously) is a bad strategy.  So while I personally don't care what you do with your body when it comes to drugs, if it creates negative conditions in society for me, that's actually a problem.

Selling body parts is another really, really bad thing.  You should be able to do whatever you want with your body, right?  Well, if you can sell your body parts, then there's an actual market for body parts.  And that means that I might be *forced* into selling my body parts so that someone can make money on this market, or even just as a method of torture.  That's very, very bad.  I don't really care about your body (so long as whatever happens to it is consensual), but I do care about a society where selling your organs might be considered a viable means of survival.  I know it's mostly just a bunch of Christian propaganda (and plot), but in Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, Fantine does just that.  Before she has to turn to prostitution, she sells some of her body parts, because she desperately needs the money.  It should never be possible for someone to be that desperate that selling one's body parts is considered a viable choice.

As for prostitution, there's a similar concern about selling yourself into prostitution.  You should never be in a position where you're either forced into prostitution (happens a lot) or that you feel it's your only hope.  The difference here is that you might actually *want* to be a prostitute.  It's a reasonable thing to want to do.  It's *not* a reasonable thing to be *forced* to do, either by another person or by circumstance.  If prostitution is well-regulated, it's not harmful.  You know, regular mandatory STD tests, safe spaces, that sort of thing.  Many jurisdictions around the world have this.  As a moral choice, it's none of your business whether I approve of your prostitution or not, but if you *don't* have a choice, that's a problem.

Finally, I'd say that bodily autonomy *does* mean that a person should be able to commit suicide.  I think that's totally fine.  Again, the conditions that force a person to do this are the problem, but, honestly, outlawing suicide isn't going to stop anyone.  ""I'm not going to jump off this building because it's illegal.""  Yeah, nobody thinks that.  So I don't think the same conditions apply as for the cases where you sell your body and/or its parts.  If you want to kill yourself, I would recommend that you seek counseling and obviously not do it, but ultimately it's not my decision to make.  What are the effects of your suicide?  The biggest one is that your loved ones will be *very* unhappy.  I certainly don't want the people I care about to die!  But you're just a random person on the internet; to me, you're nobody.  (Sorry.)  It's not really going to affect me personally (though it would actually really suck if something I said caused a death, so please don't do it).  I support the right to suicide; I just don't want anyone I know to exercise it!

As you can hopefully see, the positions are hardly parallel.  Bodily autonomy is just one argument; there are plenty of other concerns that might trump it.",1,0,1443333727,1444723333
cvfpvik,0,t1_cvfkf91,getfuckingreal,"> What are the negative effects of abortion? None, really.

You may not agree, but you are ignoring the pro-life concerns. You may not agree but to some the negative effect is the same as infanticide.

I think most pro-choice believe that. Its not all or nothing. It just doesn't meet the threshold they are comfortable with. 

For instance, I'm comfortable giving you bodily autonomy if you want to have an early abortion. I'm not comfortable giving you bodily autonomy to have an abortion in the 9th month, except the mother's life (not that this is common or happens willynilly like some think it does).

cvfe097,1,t3_3mik7h,frozengold83,"Even though most people here are probably thinking you're an idiot, you raise a fair point, I do support bodily autonomy. 

Lets go off each...

Prostitution: Yes I believe this should be legalized, all sexual activity between consenting adults is in no way the governments business.

Selling their own body parts: Well, yeah. I don't really know much about this though.

Drugs: This is an issue. In a way, most illegal drugs cause people to lose control of their bodies because of addiction, and drugs can have very negative health effects whereas abortions do not and are sometimes purely done because of the potential dangers a birth could have on a woman's health.

Suicide: Kind of a similar reasoning to drugs, suicide is often done due to health issues such as clinically depression or maybe they're just not thinking clearly. Is suicide even illegal? Because there is hardly any way to prevent someone from doing it, we can only discourage it. The right to die for people with terminal diseases is reasonable.

Every thing you listed is very different all of have their own reasonings.",0,0,1443318592,1444723360
