3m97u7,How can Christian conservatives reconcile their faith with denouncing the pope on social issues?,25,creamsoda139,"I've heard a lot of Christian conservative rhetoric describing Pope Francis as a ""Marxist"" and radical leftist because he doesn't support aspects capitalism, but this confuses me. It seems the pope is simply being consistent with Jesus' teachings against greed and giving to those in need. I would certainly find it surprising if Jesus saw merit in capitalism, or at least they way it can subjugate the poor.

I was wondering if any conservative Christians here who may share the same thoughts about the pope can explain how belief in Jesus' teachings don't conflict with disliking the pope's stance on capitalism, and if there aren't any, perhaps someone can try to help me understand how it wouldn't.
