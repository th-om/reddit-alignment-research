cv1huos,1,t3_3kxjxf,AMatterofTrust,"Economically sure. Many economists want to lower the corporate tax rate significantly. Almost every economist supports more free trade, and a lot support reduced regulatory burden on small businesses. Significant evidence shows that rent control is very bad, as are farm subsidies. If you want to look up the coherent conservative talking points: [The Heritage Foundation](http://www.heritage.org/). The Heritage Foundation of course is biased, but in my view it does not make up statistics, misrepresent statistics, and every position it makes is a valid reason to support that view, unlike ThinkProgress and MotherJones, who often misrepresent quotes and statistics to further their ends. While The Heritage Foundation ignores potential downsides, (as expected it is a think tank) it presents  well reasoned and articulate argument backed up with empirical evidence. 

So if you disagree with conservative views, but want to know more about why people believe what they do (reddit, especially r/politics has a habit of dismissing everyone who disagrees as shills or simply mis-informed, when that is clearly not the case), then look at one of these think-tanks and try to rationalize the opposing argument.

Simply false.  You have to develop models, and be able to test them in order to determine causation.  You'd need to do a randomized controlled study (which is impossible for this case) or somehow rule out *every other possible confounding variable* (again, impossible in this case) in order to establish *any level of causation*.

You're getting your terms mixed up. Co-occurence literally is a relationship. Correlation is a relationship. Relationships however don't imply causation, which I'm sure is what you meant.

I understand confounding variables. I understand that the more you rule out, the closer you get to proving causation. I also understand that causation can be heavily implied without removing all of them because for most cases, as I've said, it's (impossible in this case).

Look, you're intentionally avoiding the point which is that correlation, while not equivalent to causation, does increase the possibility of causation.  

Or to put it another way - if one thing DOES cause another, do you think it's more likely your initial study will show correlation or not? (It probably will).

>You can arouse suspicion that one thing causes another with correlation, but logically correlation and causation are two completely different things.

This is all I have said. Correlation can arouse suspicion of causation, and if done so repeatedly with consistent results can start to look like a pretty strong argument for it.

Speaking of reading comprehension did you actually read the study you posted? My guess is no since the link you posted doesn't even link to the study. 

The study in question is done by Hemenway who is quoted as saying ""people who carry guns are cowards"" and many other anti-gun biased things. He engineers his studies to say what he wants them to say, not speak the truth.

He cherry picks the 10 states with the highest murder and highest gun ownership rates. Then he picks 10 states with low murder rates and low gun ownership rates. He ignores examples like Vermont, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Minnesota which have low gun control and low gun murders. 

The study your article talks about is exactly what friendly fired was warning people about.  A biased study with fudged number **designed** to support the anti-gun argument.

Free trade is an obvious one; essentially every economist supports it as other comments have mentioned.

For more controversial arguments around these parts (that I nevertheless see as pretty straightforward logically), I'd go with 1) the argument that capital gains *is* double taxation and 2) the argument that tax increases and spending cuts *aren't* different sides of the same coin when it comes to deficits.

**1) Capital gains.**  Liberals like them, conservatives hate them.  Truth is they are double taxation (as best I can tell) and contrary to what is often said, those paying capital gains aren't ""paying lower rates than their secretaries."" 

Why?  Because taxes were already paid on the principle.  In a world without income taxes you earn $100, invest it and wait for it to double, and then you've got $200.  In a world *with* income taxes, you earn $100, pay a 30% tax on it, so now you've only got $70 to invest.  You invest the $70, wait for it to double and now you've got $140.  Which you'll notice is 30% less than you would have had if you hadn't paid a tax on the original principle.  You're out $60 total ($200-$140).  $30 was paid as a 30% tax on the original $100 you earned.  And then another $30 was paid on the $100 you gained from the investment.  

Now, let's say that in this world everyone pays 30% income taxes and 25% capital gains taxes. Someone could say ""Hey, the capital gains rate is lower than the income tax rate.  That's not fair, those investors are paying less than the workers.""  But that's not correct, because going back to the example with $70, when you add a 25% capital gains tax on the $70 you earned from investment, you're left with $52.5 + $70 = $132.5.  Remember you had $200 in a world without taxes.  So, clearly this has been taxed at an effective rate of 33%, not 25%.  

When Warren Buffet invests and pays taxes on his gains, he's paying a higher effective rate than his secretary because he paid it back in the 1950s when he originally earned his principle.  As soon as he paid a 30% tax in 1951 when he earned his original principle, he has 30% less to invest, and thus his gains from the investment of that principle is 30% less, and everything he earns from that investment in the 60s, 70s, 80s, til he dies is reduced by 30%.

**2) Spending decreases and tax increases for combating the deficit.**  A lot of people use the analogy of a family budget when it comes to the federal budget and deficit.  So they say... ""your family's running a deficit, you either gotta spend less (by analogy gov cuts spending) or earn more (by analogy the gov raises taxes).  We should compromise and do both.""  But that is an incorrect analogy.  The government spending less is analogous to a family spending less to come in under budget, but raising taxes is more analogous to visiting the ATM than it is to a family earning more.  

Why?  Because the government doesn't actually earn money.  I don't mean this in a derogatory, ""I hate the gov"" type of way... it's just simply not what the government does or is meant to do.  *People* earn money by producing something or providing some service.  And they can only earn a limited amount of it.  If the gov taxes 20% of it, that's 20% that's not there tomorrow to tax again, just like if you withdraw $20 from the ATM, that's $20 that's not there tomorrow to withdraw again.

It's true raising taxes and collecting more money will decrease the number on that debt clock website.  And your children will have less debt to pay down in the future.  But you'll also have less money to leave to your children in their inheritance.  How much less?  Well, however much got contributed to paying down the debt.  See where I'm going with this?  Raising taxes to deal with the debt is more akin to shifting money around, just like withdrawing money from the ATM is shifting money from your checking account to your wallet.  Sometimes it's a good thing to go to the ATM, but you should always be clear that that's what you're doing- you aren't generating cash out of thin air and the government isn't ""earning"" more by taxing more.",5,0,1442284594,1444728962

cv25x0w,0,t1_cv1wvub,work_but_on_reddit,"Though I see your argument on capital gains, I'm not sure it holds up very well. For capital gains, you are both presuming that the principle was taxed as income and you overlook that some of the gains are probably due to compounding returns.  So you are not ""double-taxed"" on the gains that your capital gains are making.  This is very important for the cases such as Buffet you mention. In addition to this, you are going to always find examples of financial systems where taxes are applied at multiple steps. It's just the nature of how money flows around the economy.  Corporations are taxed and then the dividends they distribute are taxed. Payroll tax followed by income tax. Income tax followed by sales tax. etc.   Setting up taxation points around the financial system ensure that no one can find egregious loopholes.

Taxation is always going to appear unfair, regardless of how it's applied.  Capital gains is probably one of the most fair taxes around, as it specifically targets money that consists of the wealthy's expendable capital. I would much prefer this sort of tax over ones that over-burden those already the most desperate (sales tax).

> Because the government doesn't actually earn money. I don't mean this in a derogatory, ""I hate the gov"" type of way... it's just simply not what the government does or is meant to do. People earn money by producing something or providing some service.

The government can and does earn money in a huge number of ways.  At the most raw level, the government sells its resources (minerals, logging rights, radio spectrum). It also earns money at the GDP level by investing in the nation's infrastructure.  The Interstate system and the Internet are two examples of government work that has earned the country many billions of dollars.",2,0,1442308530,1444728962
cv2ge6c,0,t1_cv25x0w,hjjslu,"Ok so I believe on capital gains you've brought up two issues.  1) compounded capital gains aren't double taxed and 2) lots of things are already double taxed anyways.  On 2) I agree with you that capital gains aren't the only example of double taxes, but I think that in general double taxing isn't a very efficient way to tax things so it should be avoided when possible.  Think of it this way- you can tax income and then tax it again a second time when its invested and the gains are realized but this is obviously going to discourage some people from investing who would otherwise want to invest.  Better to just tax it more the first time and let people invest freely without disincentive effects.

On 1) I'm not sure I understand how compounded gains aren't taxed twice, could you elaborate a little or provide a simple example?  But if we go back to the original example, we've got a guy with $140 and could pull it out and pay a 25% tax on the $70 gain ($17.50) so that he's walking away with $122.50 (I accidentally wrote $132.50 in the original example, but the point stands).  Or he could roll over the investment and let the $140 double again so that he's got $280, $210 of which is capital gains that he pays 25% tax on leaving him with $157.50 + $70 = $227.50 which he keeps.  In the world without taxes he reinvested the $200 and waits for it to $400.  So the total effective tax rate paid in this example is 1 - (227.5/400) = 43%.  Which is higher than if he'd just pulled out and not reinvested, and it's much higher than the secretary at 30%.  Which shouldn't be that surprising because a higher percentage of the amount he's cashing out came from the capital gain, in other words a higher percentage came from the part that's being double taxed.

On the topic of government earnings, I agree that there are probably some ways that you could reasonably define ""earnings"" where the government could be said to ""earn"" something.  But remember the analogy was regarding *taxation* as earning more income.  And I don't think any of the examples of radio rights or interstate system makes *taxation* more like earning income and less like going to the ATM.",1,0,1442333636,1444728962
cv2j6aw,0,t1_cv2ge6c,work_but_on_reddit,"> I'm not sure I understand how compounded gains aren't taxed twice, could you elaborate a little or provide a simple example? 

My main concern is about old money that now acts as a trust. This is essentially a limitless supply of income for people who don't have to work for it.  

Say I bought APPL in the 90's for $1/share.  It's now worth over $100/share.  The overwhelming majority of the capital was never taxed here.  You can argue counterfactually that if I had more investment capital to begin with, I could have bought more stock. However, that's pretty much true regardless of how you were taxed. Income tax, sales tax, land tax, etc. all take money out of your bank account.  I see nothing special about the fact that it was your income that was taxed.

> Which is higher than if he'd just pulled out and not reinvested, and it's much higher than the secretary at 30%. 

I think it's safe to say that any time a politician runs the numbers, they are telling a half-truth at best.  I agree with you that this is a disingenuous way to argue the case.

Us plebs get a pretty decent break on capital gains taxes.  Retirement accounts are tax free. So are muni bond interest payments.  So is the first ~$200k capital gain on sale of your primary residence (the government subsidy of the housing market is a whole other rat's nest of poor governing...).  The hurt of capital gains taxes is mostly felt by the capitalists.  So the question here is whether they'd do something else with their money other than invest it.  Seems unlikely that Buffet is going to say ""I'm going to take the $20 billion I would have invested in Heinz and instead treat myself to a nice vacation"".  ",1,0,1442337916,1444728962
cv2x3xk,0,t1_cv2j6aw,hjjslu,"I agree with you that an unfortunate consequence (as far as fairness is concerned) is that some people get to live off of capital gains and have their parents pay the taxes on principle back when it was originally earned.  Most of us aren't that lucky and those that are probably don't have very good work habits because of it.

In the Apple example, it's always to tough to get in a debate about counterfactuals and everything, but I would say I'm not really trying to singling out income tax as the only way money can be taxed or the only thing that can counterfactually prevent you from investing more than you otherwise would- I just used income taxes as an example because it's probably a relatively large tax for most people investing money compared to other taxes, but I agree that other taxes can sometimes work the same way.

When it comes to Warren Buffet and whether capital gains stop him from investing, I would say most investors and capital gains payers aren't Warren Buffet.  They might not be ma' and pa' but they aren't literally billionaires either.  When they're evaluating how they want to invest their money and they're looking at a projected rate of return and the risk associated with that investment, it doesn't seem at all crazy to me that some people look possible investments they might have been interested in and say something like ""yeah, but after all the tax's are paid out I'm really only projected to get a 5.5% return and it's just not worth the risk.  I'd rather just put it in a safer investment that isn't subject to capital gains.""  Obviously that's not like the end of the world or anything, but it is, I think, pressuring people to do things they wouldn't have otherwise chosen to do as a first option.
