The best way to do this is to eliminate federal student loans that are driving up the cost of college and devaluing the degrees that are earned.

You actually should try to spell out your position.  Otherwise I can't respond.  I can tell you that government issued degrees do not create jobs, reduce demand via taxation and actually make the degrees fairly worthless (since everyone has one).

The others, like I said merit (4.0+) based grants and expanded science and mathematics scholarships. But really get rid of four year student loans provided by the fed, have loans for trade schools or career path community college programs (nursing, it, mechanic). Or subsidize those with tuition for labor programs IE apprentenship.

This way smart people who deserve to go college go. People not as intelligent still get access to valuable trade skills, AND the price of college/community college deflates. 

I'd be for compressing English and other subjects in highschool, have CS courses, philosophy courses and also requiring students complete up to calculus before graduating.

So more or less putting a good chunk of 100 level classes into high schools.",1,0,1442959406,1444725762

As a low income student that worked while in college (usually multiple jobs including a part time job as a *licensed* electrician), who recently finished a masters degree and who finished a bachelors degree (both with highest honors), I have to disagree with you.

What you are saying is actually pretty insulting to trade laborers. A lot of those guys are really dedicated to their profession and are quite smart.

cv9e2gk,0,t1_cv9d86h,CompactedConscience,"Using the fact that the world needs ditch diggers to justify not expanding access to education seems off. This is true even if your argument is based on aptitude. 

We have a lot of evidence that the average financial return to a college education is positive. In other words, the average student who gets a college degree earns more than the average student who does not. I have seen papers with estimates in the double digit pecentage points for the change in annual earnings for an extra year of school. Most estimates area bit lower, but still around 7%. This suggests that even many below average college students see a benefit from extra schooling. 

In the status quo, people from families that can afford college have a distinct advantage regardless of aptitude. Only the very brightest people, far fewer than everyone at or above the average, get scholarships based on aptitude. ",1,0,1442866498,1444725762

cv9mlw9,1,t3_3lu6k2,Risk_Neutral,"The value college has added has decreased over time as the number of college students has increased. The notion that everyone will earn more if they all have a college education isn't true. Sure, a more educated population is always better than the alternative but we should start from what is already provided for free. College readiness is quite low and we need to invest in high schools. The first step would be to add computer science as a new core standard early in education perhaps in place of foreign language. 

In my opinion, education should always be a meritocracy. Though who have worked hard, regardless of economic status, should be able to go wherever they want. Part of this is the government's responsibility through grants and low interest loans which should be tax deductible. We also have to make ""not-for-profit"" private universities more accountable for their rises in tuition. Laws should limit compensation for any not-for-profit worker. It's a moral hazard to college presidents who are making millions of dollars, trying to expand and laying the cost on the students. A student is charged for an expense that will not add additional resources to this student's own education. 

I agree that college shouldn't be free. It will create classism in education. Take New York for example: A state with the SUNY and CUNY system. The in-state tuition of these schools are barely $6000 and students who are eligible for aid can actually earn money while going to these schools as most of the tuition is paid for by the Pell Grant, whereas they can keep any TAP Grant money. Plenty of students still go the private university route. Often, they have much higher graduation rates, much lower student to professor ratios, among other benefits. Even then, those who can afford to go to a private school, will go to a private school. 


My proposed solution is a tax deduction on student loans. Moreover, the idea needs to be floated around to hold not-for-profit universities accountable for operating like for-profit universities. The latter is a much more difficult problem and needs to be looked at thoroughly. ",1,0,1442880483,1444725762
