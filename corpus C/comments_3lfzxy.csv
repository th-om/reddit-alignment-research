Yes, if you borrow too much relative to GDP, people stop being willing to lend to you and you get a budget crunch. I'm not saying elect Bernie Sanders and then tell him to go full throttle and pass a $12 trillion dollar budget.

The debt ceiling is literally a political game created by congress. Congress sets the budget and the debt limit. It is 100% within Congress' hands whether or not we hit the debt ceiling. It's a made up number that congress passes to make the government seem fiscally responsible. 

An engineered government shutdown is basically the same thing.

The House has every right to not accept what the Senate wants. However, something ultimately has to be proposed that can get through both chambers of Congress. A budget defunding Planned Parenthood can't make it through the Senate, so it's not a viable solution. 

> It's a two way street but only one party gets crushed for using it.

You are aware that Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and that the disagreement over the current funding is largely infighting among the Republicans, right? The Republican leaders in both chambers want to pass a budget that funds Planned Parenthood because they know it is politically unfeasible to try to defund the organization right now, but a segment of conservative ideologues in the House are refusing to vote for anything that funds PP.

This is true.

Many of the services Planned Parenthood provides such as Pap smears, breast exams, tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and abortions— can be performed by gynecologists, family practitioners and pediatricians. The ACA guarantees coverage for the vast majority of women’s reproductive needs, given this - why are Planned Parenthood funding levels not on the budget table?

We are down to 4 million with more than half of the States expanding Medicaid.

My point is that maybe planned Parenthood funding should be cut in half given the problem is cut in half by expansion of Medicaid and the implementation of Obamacare that now covers many who now have access to traditional sources of medical care.

The facts are clear: 47 million women now have birth control, cancer screenings, and other preventive health services at no out of pocket cost. Soon, 12 million uninsured women will qualify for coverage.

Please try to understand I am not talking about those who are newly covered I'm talking about the majority of people who have insurance and still use planned parenthood.   Your talking about gutting a service because we have managed to get more people signed up for insurance regardless of all of the other people who use it.

Well the legality is up for debate, there are plenty on the right that said they violated this and many on the left who support them saying they are not breaking the law. The link you have is only for two of the videos out of ten, so who knows at this point.
