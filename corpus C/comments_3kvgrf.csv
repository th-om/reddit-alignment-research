I'm not happy with his stance on surveillance at all or his occasional lack of conviction.  But his foreign policy has been tempered and more geared to diplomacy and working with other nations than Bush.  Yes the Middle East is a mess, but in reality we had no way to prevent it after we went into Iraq and the Iran deal is a step forward.  The START treaty w/ Russia was a coup and relations were getting better w/ them until Mendelev was replaced by Putin as President.  The sanctions on Russia is hurting their economy (along w/ the major drop in oil prices) and I rather that then getting into a proxy war w/ Russia over the Crimea.  Even the wars we have gotten involved with (Libya, Anti-Pirating in Somalia, ISIS) we have either done b/c we were asked to (Arab League w/ Libya, Eastern Africa and more in Somalia) or have gone into to prevent genocide (ISIS).  Has his foreign policy been perfect, no.  But his approach has been way better and in a game of 190+ individual players, cultivating friendships/having convenient partnerships for a short time and having a power bloc to get something done is way better then going at it alone.  

His domestic policy has been severely tempered b/c the GOP has controlled the house since 2010 but the bits and pieces he does get through since are generally good outside of surveillance and he is progressive on social policies.  He is a solid president who hasn't done anything spectacular outside of ACA and ordering the raid on Osama Bin Laden, but he hasn't done anything debilitatingly wrong yet.
