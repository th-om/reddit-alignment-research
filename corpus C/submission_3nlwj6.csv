3nlwj6,"I thought I would give Bernie Sanders chance after he drew just over 20,000 people in Boston. I like what I hear from his speeches on YouTube and articles I read, but I came across his 'Rape Fantasy' Essay should I be concerned about supporting him?",23,rosechaltry,"From NPR:
So what did Bernie Sanders write and what did he say about rape?
The essay by the Vermont senator, who officially kicked off his presidential campaign this week, isn't long — only a page. Warning: The bit about rape comes at the very beginning, as does some not-totally-safe-for-work language:

""A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused.

""A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously.

""The man and woman get dressed up on Sunday — and go to Church, or maybe to their 'revolutionary' political meeting.

""Have you ever looked at the Stag, Man, Hero, Tough magazines on the shelf of your local bookstore? Do you know why the newspaper with the articles like 'Girl 12 raped by 14 men' sell so well? To what in us are they appealing?""

I don't know how you explain that.
