cvkv1ia,0,t1_cvku3bb,Propsat,"But can the US afford it to be seen as too weak to protect its allies as soon as semi-powers like Russia start using force? 

This goes especially for future allies and Nato partners alike. What will they think when the US asks for help?

Especially since the US has failed its allies in the Ukraine, now they failed their allies in Syria. At which point does the US draw the line? When the Russians invade Poland? Germany? ",-1,0,1443728518,1444720863

It won't matter - you'll be dead from a nuclear strike tomorrow. 

The logic in this sub is flawed so much sometimes. When two countries have nuclear power, the only answer is diplomacy ",6,0,1443727232,1444720875

cvkv4w7,1,t3_3n4z8e,MiltonFriedom,"If you seriously mean to say we should bomb the Russians, then you are deranged.

But in any case, we must clarify: the rebels that we funded are not allies. They are unofficially, sure, but only because we have a common goal. They are not a country we are pledged to defend--we merely made the choice to support them.

If you were hawkish enough to want to some sort of retaliation, I can only think of attacking military assets of Assad, as that would be against Russia's goals, and instead those more aligned toward the U.S. However, this is almost certainly outside of the current authority given to the President.

If I were to take a pro-current-US policy stance, I'd say the best option is pledging to defend clear-set moderate rebels, or ramping up financial and military support for rebels.

However, my actual opinion is that no matter what, chaos will result. Often caution is the best solution, believe it or not. Or no intervention at all (except maybe creating buffer zones for civilians, and ramping up support for neighboring countries). And of course, extinguishing ISIS with greater airstrike frequency.
