3kjoe3,"Based on everything we know right now, who do you think wins the Presidency in 2016?",100,EatHumans,"Sanders is polling up with Clinton, now, and it seems she is down across the board.  Trump is still a monster in the GOP race, but Ben Carson is making moves.  Bush has the name recognition.  

Who do you think will be the matchup and who will be the winner?
