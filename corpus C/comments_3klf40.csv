Additionally, so far as I am aware no social science research backs up the contention that Hippies were/are degenerate or that sense can be physically beat into ""riff raff"". 

Again, so far as I am aware, the preponderance of research suggests that violence against minority views only solidifys the underlying ideology. ",4,0,1442024395,1444729980

I mean I'd accept at face value the assertion that virtues are a cultural expression bounded by environmental context, but I am aware of no evidence supporting the idea that ethical or moral values have a biological root. 

If asking for repeatable results and theories that are falsifiable is silly what other means would you suggest for debating opposing ideas? If scientism isn't a means to doing that it seems that all cultural and ethical debates would boil down to whether vanilla is really better than chocolate. ",3,0,1442025435,1444729980
