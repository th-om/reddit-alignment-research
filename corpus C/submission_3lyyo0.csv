3lyyo0,A Proposal to redraw US. Democracy and how to talk about it,11,sheeple666,"I posted this on [/r/SRSDiscussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/3lx2lm/a_proposal_to_redraw_us_democracy_and_how_to_talk/) if anybody was interested.

The United States of America is a federation of independent states that each have their own government, but steadily it has become an increasing unitary country. 

*“Before the Civil War, the states were all separate. People used to say ""United States are."" Wasn't until the war ended, people started saying ""The United States is."" *


-Nicolas Cage in a Nicolas Cage movie because Nicolas Cage

Since its inception the US has both grown from around 4 [million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1790_United_States_Census)  people to over 320 [million](http://www.census-charts.com/Population/pop-us-1790-2000.html) and from [13](http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/07/news/la-sh-gif-us-history-map-20140305-dto) states to a little more than [50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASSOQDQvVLU).

I believe[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o_kH5tAggk&feature=youtu.be) as my own personal opinion[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dhXrzs8pJc) that the US is only becoming more of a united country than a united coalition of separate governments. That as technology increases and the economy globalizes the US is more and more seen as a singular country; e pluribus unum

I also believe[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBJU9ndpH1Q&feature=youtu.be) that this as the unfortunate side effect of creating inconvenience and impracticality to a single government trying to represent this vast amount of people and the even more unfortunate side effect of absolutely polarizing any national discussion into slogan driven oversimplistic us v. them stalemate that leaves no room for nuance or an actual solution to any given issue.
I believe that there's a cost in a streamlined approach. 

Having one large department(e.g. IRS, Agriculture, Education etc) to do one massive task (logistically speaking) instead of a similar but smaller department do a similar but smaller task creates a government that has a harder time representing the people and cater to each individual community as well slow down reforms or improvements within each department. 

The two party system in the US polarizes and oversimplifies issues that has plenty of nuance and complexity[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzY7S_RGHm4) not as a result of culture or political system per se but as a result of the practicality of having such a large population under one democracy. [This system, I believe, fails on the federal level to sufficiently serve the people that elected them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig)

I believe that the [people feel the same way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections). and have even more so for state governments. I think most people feel like state politics are tedious and complicated[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A) and mooted by a federal government; that their involvement is benign or overall just insignificant. Their state based news agency is under-resourced and under-incentivized to accurately portray a candidate so that [these guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Kyrk5s26w) are elected and John Oliver is able to make [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9Kyrk5s26w).


If we look at other countries that rank higher that the US in terms of [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy). we tend to see developed countries with a much smaller population. I believe there is a connection in this. The United States is a [big country](http://mapfrappe.com/?show=32565) And sometimes it's hard to see the link between citizen and country.

Hypothetically speaking[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Sbt345jkk&feature=youtu.be) if each law was to be done by direct democracy each

American would have ca. 1/320000000
and each

Estonian would have ca. 1/1000000

I know that doesn’t seem like a lot but it's still that's a number two orders of magnitude smaller. Listen[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sbb4EL0ybs&feature=youtu.be) please keep in mind that this is a hypothetical question and no you can't measure vote to vote like valuta but in this hypothetical scenario

1 eStonian vote = 320 American votes

that gives a lot more say so over their own government for each citizen of Estonia than the United States. I believe that this gives ground for a much stronger public educational system and emphasizes a much greater importance on rational discussions on a national level.

I believe that this is possible in America too. If we were to redraw the states as if we were to split up the US into separate countries[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blpe_sGnnP4) we could return to leaving a lot more control from the federal government into the state level.

I think this makes intuitive sense to some people because if you though of all the people in the country that agree with you on at least ten key political issues[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKgMZBCV2ko&feature=youtu.be) I think that would be enough people for a whole country by itself.

The counter argument might be that

> *“While there might be enough people to form a country who all generally agree on ten key issues, what about the rest of the issues? And how far do they agree? Taking [the] example of gun control, let's say the citizens of [a newly formed state] all agree that some gun control sounds like a good idea. That still leaves -lots- of room for differing points of view, as one person might want to ban all guns while another thinks there should be exceptions for hunting rifles or personal defense rounds. Multiply this example by the many, many political issues worldwide and you're always going to find room for debate in any large group of people.”*

But I believe taking down the population number frees people up for nuance opinions and greatly opens up for a serious discussion instead of this polarized black and white slogan debate that we have today. 

I imagine the new border could look something like the cultural “nations” of North America
e.g.

* The [11 Nations.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2013/11/08/which-of-the-11-american-nations-do-you-live-in/)

* The [9 nations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Nations_of_North_America)

Generally I support federal elections to be determined by the populist vote but if we were to retain the electoral college[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-g6ktf9iE0) could a case not be argued for redrawn voting zones/mock states?

* A proposed [50 state map.](http://fakeisthenewreal.org/reform/)

* A proposed [38 state map.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/57444/map-only-38-states)

Now naturally I don't think this idea is realistic in any way. To say that Texans ***REALLY*** Texas and regard its borders borderline holy is still an understatement. (I *would* like to mention that The Velvet Divorce, The Scottish English Union, Schlesvig Holstein, and the Commonwealth Nations have happened relatively peacefully.) What I'm really curious about is what you guys think about this idea and more so how do most Americans feel about this proposal. If I wanted to find out how laws would differ for each new state[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-g6ktf9iE0) how would I go about doing that? I am only one person and have no experience with surveys or gathering demographic information[,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) yet I am enthust about how to go about doing so. 

Ideally I would love to be able to have map that showed the US with it's redrawn states borders and clear view the differing laws of each state. 

Official Language? 

Size of state government?

Form of government? i.e. number of elections and balance of direct and representative democracy

Welfare and unemployment system?

Educational standards and policy?
