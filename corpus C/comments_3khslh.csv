Yes, he is 100% a social democrat, he supports a capitalist social democratic system alike in Scandinavian countries.

Democratic socialism isn't a description of government, it's a strategy to achieve socialism. There are 2 strategies in socialism: Revolutionary socialism and Reformist socialism.  Democratic socialism is a synonym for Reformist socialism.

The idea behind democratic socialism is to use the pre-existing political democracy in a capitalist system to slowly reform the system, until you finally vote out capitalism. AFAIK no society has successfully implemented socialism using the democratic socialist/reformist method.


Copy pasting a post I made before...
__________

Scandinavian countries are indeed capitalist social democracies.

Democratic socialism is a... confusing term.  It can be boiled down to 2 different definitions:

**1: A synonym for reformist socialism**, (the idea that we bring socialism through the pre existing political democracy and slowly vote our way to socialism) which is opposed to revolutionary socialism. (the idea that we bring socialism through a workers revolution and overthrowing of the bourgeoisie)

**In this definition, it isn't so much a political ideology as it is actually a strategy for implementing socialism.** You will have reformist socialists who are anarchists or for a Soviet system.

**2: A political democracy alongside a socialist economy**.  This definition is actually vague in itself.  What do you define as a political democracy? What do you define as NOT a political democracy?  This definition isn't a strategy, and there are reformists and revolutionaries who would label themselves a DemSoc.  However, more often than not, it's meant to be used relative to the Soviet system and claiming that it wasn't democratic enough, (even though structurally it was similar to a political democracy) and that this idea of a democratic socialist society would have a political democracy structured in such a way that it would be more democratic. 

In my opinion, the 2nd definition should no longer be used because of how vague it is, and also because ALL socialism is democratic. (by definition)

______
So, let's now look at Scandinavian countries.

Are they democratic socialist states as to the 1st definition? Probably. There are people who claim to be reformist socialists that are attempting to make gradual change to socialism, and have power in some of these states.  But remember, in this definition, democratic socialism is a STRATEGY, not a description of government, so Scandinavia is still a social democracy.

Are Scandinavian countries democratic socialist states of the second definition?  No. Even though this definition is very vague and unhelpful, it still requires that you have a socialist economic system, which not a single Scandinavian country has.  All of them are capitalist.

_____
Lastly, is social democracy the same as democratic socialism?

No.  Social democracy describes a country with a large social and welfare state, and significant state oversight over the economy in the form of regulation or nationalization, i.e. social market economy.  However, a social democracy still operates with a capitalist mode of production.

________


So now this question.  Can you be a democratic socialist (reformist) AND a social democrat at the same time? Yes!

Does that mean Bernie Sanders is both?  No, although he did use to have ties with socialists and communists in his youth, almost all of his former comrades have renounced Bernie Sanders and have gone so far to claim that Bernie Sanders likely abandoned the ideology of socialism long ago when he entered politics.  Obviously, these are the anecdotes of his close friends from the past, but that's really all you will get.  

Regardless if he is or not, it will NOT matter to American voters. It will only matter to socialists.  Most Reformist socialists will support him regardless as they see him as a tool to further their ends: promote radical thought, create class consciousness, and bring the US closer to voting out capitalism. A small handful of Revolutionary socialists would support him too: promote radical thought, create class consciousness, make revolution more likely, make the state easier to overthrow.

So I really don't understand why he calls himself a democratic socialist. It gets him bad attention, it gives his opponents strong ammunition, and it triggers knee jerk reactions in half the population.  

What should matter to Americans is what government he advocates, which is social democracy.  The only thing important here is that Bernie is a SOCIAL DEMOCRAT.

The DSA are an example of socialists who will support Bernie Sanders regardless if he is actually a democratic socialist or not.

When you talk about ""slowly reforming the system to the point of finally voting out capitalism"", what would private businesses look like compared to how they look today? 

For example, I posted an example of a business scenario a few weeks ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/3inoqa/in_a_socialist_state_does_an_entrepreneur/) where I wanted to understand how a small startup would look in terms of distribution of money, and salary in particular.

>When you talk about ""slowly reforming the system to the point of finally voting out capitalism"", what would private businesses look like compared to how they look today?

Are you referring to the transition stage BETWEEN socialism and capitalism? That would be social democracy, and you can just look at Scandinavian countries to get an idea.

If you mean socialism itself, know that voting out capitalism doesn't mean it has to be a specific type of socialism.  It could be voting out capitalism and the state, it could be voting out capitalism and in a soviet system, it could be voting out capitalism and having a market socialist economy, etc.  Though generally reformists support a non soviet type of socialism while maintaining the state due to not adopting a Marxist analysis.

In the types of socialism I know, there wouldn't be private businesses.  The closest you would have is area specific enterprises that handled distribution/production and then non competitive worker run stations that do not operate for profit and would likely be controlled by the state.  There wouldn't be a boss or CEO, rather the workers are given some leeway in how something operates, as long as it doesn't conflict with state regulations.  There would be no markets.

Basically it would act more as a place where you exchange your labor (which is represented in money) for something. But there are no markets, there is no competition, and there isn't an idea of ""expanding"" a business.

It's difficult for me to give a really good explanation because you are likely thinking in the context of capitalism, so it might not make sense to you.

I recommend 3 things if you want to learn:

/r/socialism101

/r/communism 

[This article](https://gowans.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/do-publicly-owned-planned-economies-work/)

The 101's are good places to ask, though /r/socialism101 is not specific to any ideology so you could answers for all kinds of socialism.  /r/communism101 is more active, more educated, but will answer from a Marxist or Leninist derivative perspective.

The article is pro USSR, so I understand why one would not read it and feel uncomfortable to read it, but through their viewpoints, it offers a description and analysis of how the economic system of the USSR worked.
