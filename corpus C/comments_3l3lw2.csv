Any shady business deals or practices are already out there, and there's a couple really interesting documentaries on the subject. 

His Vietnam war issue, those hazy medical deferments, that's out there, but it never quite reached the surface. So maybe that'll become a bigger deal at some point.

Given that the only veterans in the race (that I can recall) are Graham and Webb, neither of whom are polling above one percent, I'm of the opinion that most won't care about his Vietnam status. Clinton and Bush were both elected despite questions about what they did during that era.

Whether it'd be enough to kill his campaign? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. Again - it's Trump. Rules don't apply. But with his new-found crusade for 'the Vets!' and his whole 'I'm so militaristic, you wouldn't even believe it' thing, being found out to be a draft dodger, it'd be big.

>Mr. Gunnels, the Sanders aide, said the campaign hasn’t worked out all details on his plan—for instance, his version might allow each state to run its own single-payer system. But he said the $15 trillion figure was a fair estimate.


Then they make the BOLD assumption:

> If I told you I could cut your health insurance premiums by $1,000 and increase your taxes by $1,000, you wouldn’t have lost $1,000. You’d be in the same place you are now.

This is a pretty bold assumption that the government agency would be just as streamlined as the private agency currently running it.  The VA is currently running over $12k / enrollee, [Medicaid averages at $13k /enrollee](http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-spending-per-enrollee/) , [Medicare comes in just over $10k](http://kff.org/medicare/state-indicator/per-enrollee-spending-by-residence/).  So it's a pretty bold statement to say ""Oh yeah the gov't will run it just as efficiently as the private sector"" don't you think?

The rest of the article is just conjecture and Bernie stumping with no actual backup other than ""Bernie says it so we believe it"".
