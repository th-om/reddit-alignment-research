When Bush left office, America didn't know where bin Laden was. In August 2010 (during Obama's term), a former Pakistani intelligence officer approached the U.S. embassy station chief in Islamabad and offered to provide Bin Laden's location, in return for the $25 million reward. The official passed polygraph tests, after which the U.S. began local and satellite surveillance of Bin Laden's Abbottabad residence.

Even this, I would not attribute to Obama, nor to Bush. Hunting down bin Laden after 9/11 was a no-brainer, so naturally both had intelligence agencies looking for him.

What I *would* credit Obama for was this: he okayed the mission, invading a sovereign nation's airspace without their prior approval (as was necessary, given that intelligence indicated that they were heavily compromised and would have warned him). He was the one who took a risk on this, and he is the one who would have paid a severe political price if the mission had failed - you can't honestly tell me that Republicans *wouldn't* be jumping up left and right to blame him if the mission had failed.

But if the moon landing mission had failed? Nixon couldn't possibly have suffered any negative press from that. Everyone tied that mission to JFK, and it wouldn't be the first failure the Apollo mission had suffered. Apollo 1 infamously caught fire, killing the three astronauts inside. If Apollo 11 had suffered a similar catastrophe, Nixon could have simply pointed to the earlier failure as an indication of what a risky venture this was, and chosen at that time to end it.

On the contrary, Nixon only stood to lose if he chose to shelve the program. America was deep in the space race with the Russians, and after coming in second to the Russians with Sputnik, if Nixon had chosen to give up on the space race right as we were on the cusp of our greatest achievement, it would have been a national embarrassment.

So Nixon did the obvious thing - he stayed the fuck out of the way. But he doesn't deserve credit for that. He didn't take any risks, he didn't contribute any significant vision or insight. Obama at least took a very large risk with bin Laden. And for that, Obama deserves credit. But Nixon?

That is generations upon generations away.  

This is actually classified info, but I'm posting from behind ten proxies so the NSA won't get me.  There is actually a highly trained tenth team of navy seals that operate under the cover of a deep sea oil rig.  The team is cleared for space ops.  ",0,0,1443508249,1444722775

That's exactly where I was going.  By saying we shouldn't spend billions on science that largely leads to nowhere, I'm saying we should cut all medical research and alternate energy sources.  Personally, I'm like a super mega conservative (a Christian one).  I think the best time period was when Jesus was born, so I'd prefer that we just get rid of all technological and scientific advances and go back to 0 AD.

We'll wait until resources are starting being exhausted to start investing in this. Forget the fact China has plans to mine He-3 from the moon. Nuclear energy is way too overrated, we can just keep burning fuels right? Sure our kids and grand kids might run into trouble, but fuck them right? They're probably awful people anyways, after all they did have people like you as parents and grandparents.

See? I can be a sarcastic jackass too. ",3,0,1443476027,1444722775
cvhd9gl,0,t1_cvhb68g,AMatterofTrust,"Ok, lets make one thing clear. It is important to support space exploration, which is an opinion that I share, **but that is an ridiculous reason why we should support space exploration.** We have the technology to stop asteriods, and none are coming so ... and we have plenty of space. While the population is increasing, cities are finding more and more ways of cramming pople into spaces in a enjoyable fashion for all parties. 

No the reason why we support space exploration is the same reason we support all pure research. To increase the knowledge of humanity, to further the human race, to imagine greater things, and because we can. Those are the reasons. The reason many of us say your argument is because we all realize that the arguments I presented are extremely weak. But I, as well as everyone who supports pure research and space exploration, accepts them, which is important to do. 

i.e. don't make up justifications for supporting pure research. Accept the arguments that make sense. ",1,0,1443476429,1444722775
cvhds0u,0,t1_cvhd9gl,krabbby,"> none are coming

Unfortunately, we can only track large ones. NASA told people this after the meteor in Russia a few years back. It doesn't take a meteor the size of the one in Deep Impact or Armageddon to cause damage. They outright said we were helpless. I believe the word they used to describe our solution was ""[pray](http://www.dailytech.com/NASA+Tells+Congress+to+Pray+if+Meteor+Comes/article30171.htm)"".

But we probably can't trust astrophysicists and aerospace engineers though huh? What do they know./s",3,0,1443477248,1444722775
cvhf550,0,t1_cvhds0u,AMatterofTrust,"Can you say that the money at NASA is going to quote ""useful"" fields? If it was truly important to detect small asteroids, we would have done so. Large asteroids can be detected decades in advance.  Most NASA programs are not focused on that. Most NASA programs are not focused on solar flares. And I would be very sad if hundreds of billions of dollars are spent on those two activities alone, because honestly that is a waste of money. We can save more lives investing all of that into storm protection, rather than a once in a lifetime event that may or may not do some damage that can be detected weeks, or even years, beforehand.  

No. That money is spent on space exploration. While it is necessary in today's world for scientists to make up justifications for their research to get grants, or in this case money from Congress, we do not have to make that argument. Instead, we acknowledge the fact that the money is being used for pure research that has no practical value and **that is good.**",2,0,1443479517,1444722775
