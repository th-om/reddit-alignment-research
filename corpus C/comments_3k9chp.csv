White people, Hispanic, and Asians all experience racism and persecution, yet we don't riot over it. This is because we know that these incidents are minor and not systematic. We also know that this isn't the right way to behave, and that many times something happens not because of race but because one of the parties involved was an asshole.

>And for us to be able to gather together business leaders and local elected officials and clergy and celebrities and athletes, and figure out how are we doing a better job helping young African American men feel that they're a full part of this society and that they've got pathways and avenues to succeed -- I think that would be a pretty good outcome from what was obviously a tragic situation.

This is where the hard part is. The solutions. Most ""young African American men"" are at least somewhat aware that if they go to school, get good grades, they'll be assisted by Affirmative Action and get into a nice college for free and live a much better life than their parents, a feat which many thousands of young African American men *do* achieve in this country. So, there *are* avenues to success, I mean just look at Obama. There's this rhetoric of everything being directly attributable to ""the system"" actively oppressing African Americans (I have no idea why that term is considered PC by the way), and I just don't know how well it holds water. It definitely holds water historically. But the fact of the matter is that, in 2015, young African Americans have many avenues to escape what they're born into. The problem is, as Obama pointed out sort of dismissively, that *their peers* force them into gangs, *their peers* worship violent and degrading rap, *their peers* and even *their parents* teach them values that simply aren't conducive to living a better life. Is that historically because of racism? Most probably. 

But does it really make sense to say that, *at this stage*, *everybody but African Americans* has the opportunity to better the situation? That's the part I don't like. The communities are the way they are, violent and poor, because of racism.

That doesn't mean I'm ignoring the issue, it doesn't mean I don't care about race relations (my own mother escaped a violent hood), it's just that I don't like the idea of African Americans being the *very last people* in a position to better themselves.

I hate that that we kill with drones. I am unhappy we are still in the middle east but isn't it time to at least bring our soldiers home from Germany and Japan? 

I'm also unhappy that he doesn't seem to relate to or care about people who work for money. The rich getting richer while the poor getting poorer seems alright with him. I get that he cares about immigrants and blacks shot by police but I've never gotten the slightest sense that he cares about the average, tax paying, working, law-abiding american citizen. As far as I can tell, he stands tall with wall street, the rich and the famous. ",2,0,1441848566,1444731238

Considering the Tea Party magically appeared when he took office, I'm completely happy with what he's been able to pull off, considering. We're at full employment, have marriage equality, pre-existing condition coverage, and plenty of other accomplishments, despite an army of knuckle -dragging mouth-breathers who oppose him simply because of who he is. Doing just fine, in my opinion. Not gonna whine that Obama Claus didn't get me everything on my wish list.",0,0,1441823402,1444731238
cuvukds,1,t3_3k9chp,Riekopo,"The very fact that so many people casts their votes for a candidate because another candidate looks worse is a clear sign that there is something very wrong with our democracy. 

I never followed the President's Senate term or Presidential campaigns, but it seems to me like he has done a lot of what he set out to do. I know he has tried other things like closing Gitmo, but Congress prevented that. He hasn't been perfect, but I think he's been a pretty good President. ",0,0,1441822629,1444731238

Almost a decade later I see how naive it was. In a decade those Sanders supporters will see that it was the same thing. ",0,0,1442001512,1444731238
