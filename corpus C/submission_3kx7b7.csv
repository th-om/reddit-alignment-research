3kx7b7,Bernie Sanders and teacher unions,20,narutouz,"Sanders does get money from teacher unions.  Which is a lot better than getting a check from Goldman Sachs. But, still is important issue. How will Bernie Sanders fix problems in high schools that have poor quality of teachers. Teacher unions donating will  definitely affect his education policy. 
I feel that teachers should be serving the public because they are funded by tax dollars. If , teachers go on strike then they are depriving students from learning and damaging the public as a whole. FDR also agreed saing that ""It is impossible to collectively bargain with the federal government.""",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kx7b7/bernie_sanders_and_teacher_unions/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442245740,1444729018
