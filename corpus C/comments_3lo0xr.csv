Because the kinds of people who run for congress are the kinds of people who want to control other people, and tell them how to live their lives.  Sanders in particular doesn't view the constitution as binding, and so he doesn't feel constrained by the rules Americans have all agreed to live by for centuries *while* he proceeds to tell us how to live our lives.  

We wouldn't be having this conversation if Vermont was larger than 4 TV markets or if big labor didn't pony up 80% of the cash for every sanders election.  The guy is literally in the pocket of *one* special interest.  At least Hillary gets money from other people like environmentalists, Hollywood type, probably defense contractors.

Huh? We can't have libertarian congressmen? I'm not interested in discussing Sanders ideas but I think just calling someone a career politician is kind of a silly insult.

>There's nothing inherently wrong with being a politician. It gives you knowledge of the system, connections, and keeps you well versed on the issues.

But Sanders is proposing sweeping reforms of the private sector we all rely on to make a living.  Sanders graduated from college in '64, worked for a few years and then went into politics in '71.  So its been more than 45 years since he worked in the part of society that he wants to fundamentally change.  And I'm going to guess he never had a meaningful, really productive job in the private sector.

Nah, they're just forced to support republicans because our two party system. First past the post voting is terrible.

The vast majority of republican supporters aren't pro-republican. How could they be? The republican party is a clown show of idiots, shills, religious nuts, women haters, and yes-men for the rich.

What most republican supporters *are* are anti-Democrats, mostly fueled by elite-owned media spouting propaganda. The rest of these supporters are anti-blacks, anti-mexicans, anti-poor people, anti-women, and even anti-themselves. Thus, they vote Republican.",-7,0,1442776049,1444726372
