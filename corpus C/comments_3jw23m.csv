If her objection is having her name on the paper then a resignation would have the same effect without denying people their rights. She isn't simply choosing to follow her faith, but to force others to follow her faith.

A choice she, as a representative of the government, is denying others.

Life seems unlikely.  As long as her term as county clerk seems possible.  

The problem is that she is an elected official.  She can't be removed from office for refusing to do her job, unless an impeachment or recall election can do so (and that is doubtful).  The only recourse is to keep her off the job through contempt and allow her staff/deputies to do the job she had forbidden them to do.",1,0,1441672316,1444732090
