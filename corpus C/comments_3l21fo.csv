No, no it isn't. You're still missing the point.

50% of total federal taxes is a meaningless number. Maybe you have a trillion dollars, maybe you have ten bucks. But if you've got a trillion dollars and you're only paying a hundred bucks in taxes, and federal taxes amount to two hundred bucks, well this isn't a self-sustaining system.

People (leftists mostly) are constantly making the argument that the 1% are not paying their ""fair share"". They are more interested in what they see as ""fairness"" rather than who is actually funding the government. 

Look at this exchange between Obama and Charles Gibson:

>**Gibson:** All right. You have, however, said you would favor an increase in the capital gains tax. As a matter of fact, you said on CNBC, and I quote, “I certainly would not go above what existed under Bill Clinton,” which was 28 percent. It’s now 15 percent. That’s almost a doubling, if you went to 28 percent.

>But actually, Bill Clinton, in 1997, signed legislation that dropped the capital gains tax to 20 percent.

>**Obama:** Right.

>**Gibson:** And George Bush has taken it down to 15 percent.

>**Obama:** Right.

>**Gibson:** And in each instance, when the rate dropped, revenues from the tax increased; the government took in more money. And in the 1980s, when the tax was increased to 28 percent, the revenues went down.

>So why raise it at all, especially given the fact that 100 million people in this country own stock and would be affected?

>**Obama:** Well, Charlie, what I’ve said is that I would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness.

You can see that Obama was well prepared to sacrifice additional revenue for his interpretation of ""fairness"". 

So, there is really no contradiction in my statement at all. In general, people are concerned about revenue. But, since the left is always trying to push the narrative that the rich are not paying their ""fair share"", pointing out the contribution that they *do make* helps insulate them from that silly line of attack.
