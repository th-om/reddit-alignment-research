Completely expected.  Powell's been out of politics for the whole let's-all-hate-Obama thing.  He's a diplomat, and he actually knows what he's talking about.

""Republican"" hasn't always been defined as ""anti-Democrat"".  These days, if a Republican agrees with the Democrats on any issue, that's a huge political problem.  I'm surprised they can even name post offices together.  But Colin Powell thought about the deal and came to the conclusion that it's acceptable enough.  Remember, the Republicans were dead set against the deal before they even read it.  Powell, I would assume, actually read and understood the thing.

Also note that the other countries that negotiated the deal along with the US also support it.  The only people who don't are the Republicans, who can't support anything Obama likes on principle, and the Israelis, who have their ultra-right-wing views on Iran for whatever reason (note that Israel has made peace with *less* moderate regimes than Iran's in the last few decades; Netanyahu is just a far-right populist preying on the Israelis' legitimate fears and anger).  Everyone else is cool with the deal.  This means that the US will isolate *itself* by putting sanctions on Iran without international support.  Colin Powell is not an idiot.  He understands all of this.  And he doesn't automatically mistrust Obama either, which seems to be a modern litmus test for the Republican party these days.

Ultimately, if the deal were a bad one, we wouldn't have made it, and our allies wouldn't have been on it.  The Republicans just need to grow a pair.",21,0,1441565951,1444732200

Then the process starts up to pull them back which can be vetoed.

However, Britain's Channel 4 News reported soon afterwards that a UK intelligence dossier that Powell had referred to as a ""fine paper"" during his presentation had been based on old material and plagiarized an essay by American graduate student Ibrahim al-Marashi.[46][47] A 2004 report by the Iraq Survey Group concluded that the evidence that Powell offered to support the allegation that the Iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) was inaccurate.

> In an interview with Charlie Rose, Powell contended that prior to his UN presentation, he had merely four days to review the data concerning WMD in Iraq.[48]

> A Senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in Powell's speech. State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery.[49] The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence, particularly what was single-sourced to the informant known as Curveball. Powell later recounted how Vice President Dick Cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, ""You've got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points."" Powell's longtime aide-de-camp and Chief of Staff from 1989–2003, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, later characterized Cheney's view of Powell's mission as to ""go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two. Fall on your damn sword and kill yourself, and I'll be happy, too.""[50]

The Iraqis providing bomb-making expertise and advice to the al-Qaida organization. We know, for example, in connection with the original World Trade Center bombing in '93 that one of the bombers was Iraqi, returned to Iraq after the attack of '93. And we’ve learned subsequent to that, since we went into Baghdad and got into the intelligence files, that this individual probably also received financing from the Iraqi government as well as safe haven."" and once again in an interview with National Public Radio in January, 2004, stating that there was ""overwhelming evidence"" of a relationship between Saddam and al-Qaeda based on evidence including Iraq's purported harboring of Yasin.
In the same Meet the Press interviews, Cheney implied a connection between Iraq and Mohamed Atta; ""The Czech interior minister said today that an Iraqi intelligence officer met with Mohammed Atta, one of the ringleaders of the September 11 terrorists attacks on the United States, just five months before the synchronized hijackings and mass killings were carried out."" and ""With respect to 9/11, of course, we’ve had the story that’s been public out there. The Czechs alleged that Mohamed Atta, the lead attacker, met in Prague with a senior Iraqi intelligence official five months before the attack, but we’ve never been able to develop any more of that yet either in terms of confirming it or discrediting it. We just don’t know."" Czech officials have since backed off of this claim, and even Cheney has since acknowledged that the notion ""that the meeting ever took place"" has been ""pretty well knocked down now.""

And The intelligence community:
>In the initial stages of the war on terror, the Central Intelligence Agency, under George Tenet, was rising to prominence as the lead agency in the Afghanistan war. But when Tenet insisted in his personal meetings with President Bush that there was no connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq, V.P. Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld initiated a secret program to re-examine the evidence and marginalize the CIA and Tenet. The questionable intelligence acquired by this secret program was ""stovepiped"" to the vice president and presented to the public. In some cases, Cheney’s office would leak the intelligence to reporters, where it would be reported by outlets such as The New York Times. Cheney would subsequently appear on the Sunday political television talk shows to discuss the intelligence, referencing The New York Times as the source to give it credence.

The intelligence of the time suspected that Saddam and these groups were actually working together or at the very least that Saddam was turning a blind eye to them since they were effective as hurting the United States (enemy of my enemy is?).

In reality (20/20 hindsight knowledge) Saddam was actively hunting these new terrorist cells (so they existed, the intelligence just didn't realize Saddam was antagonistic to their existence). It was one of the many intelligence failures of Iraq. The blame lies with Clinton in the 90's who had done two things to the intelligence sector: 1.) Severe budget cuts 2.) Prohibited financial distribution to individuals who were known to have been involved in immoral activities. The number 2 essentially killed sources of intelligence in many if not all areas in Iraq and around it. Leading up to the Iraq war they had to build new intelligence infrastructure which resulted in only a few sources. One of those sources ended up being incredibly unreliable (the man hated Saddam with a passion and really wanted the U.S. to take him out).

I don't think there was any evidence that Saddam was involved in 9/11. But there was evidence (bad evidence) he was working with Al Qaeda. And the risk of Saddam passing off a newly constructed nuclear weapon (again bad intelligence, please read that report) was enough to warrant action from the United States. Bill Clinton and his administration also postured in a hostile manner towards Iraq (with several air strikes in the late 90's and a lot of drum beating after the weapons inspectors were kicked out). It also doesn't help that Saddam had repeated lied about having WMD's as bluster to his neighbors (because he hated Iran and wanted them scared).

The logic is pretty clear. Do not remove options off the table before negotiation, especially if it provides you leverage in the negotiation. Unless your intention is to give your side a shit deal.

> I expect it was used when negotiating the Iran treaty

Not when the president's party is saying ""we can't go to war with Iran it's too costly!"" Iran isn't going to take any threats seriously when Obama couldn't even keep his party in line on the issue.

>Yes, sometimes war is preferable to diplomacy.

Diplomacy is a tool, not an outcome. People perceive diplomacy as this magic hand waving that makes things alright. War is sometimes the best diplomatic solution for a given situation. You will obviously try the more peaceful solutions first, but if they will not give they need to know that war is something you will not fear using.

War is a diplomatic solution.

Diplomacy: ""the profession, activity, or skill of managing international relations, typically by a country's representatives abroad.""

There is no either or when it comes to diplomacy and war. Sometimes the outcome is paying out money. Sometimes the outcome is a country giving up claim to some land. Sometimes the outcome is support in the United Nations or other sensitive issue that the country cares about. Diplomacy is a tool used to resolve differences between the countries. Those differences can at times only be solved by war if one country is unwilling to give up what the other country perceives as highly dangerous to them.",1,0,1441756358,1444732220
