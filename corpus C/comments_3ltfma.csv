Either start small and get noticed in local (city, county) politics by your party of choice or find a platform and get some monetary support to get a staff and some publicity going. 

>and what major hurdle are there?

For the House, the main hurdle is beating the incumbent because there is a huge rate of return for Representatives. You'd need to 1) have strong enough policies and support to get you voted in, 2) Find an opponent who is struggling in their district through either lack of support or scandal, or 3) wait until the current Representative retires, then get the party's support to be the replacement.

Look for a seat on a municipal board or committee that you care about and then eventually run for commissioner. This is easier if you're in a small town but still possible in moderately sized cities. From there look into the state legislature. Their races are much less competitive and would build name recognition and experience. 

You really have to be active in a party though. You'll never get anywhere running as an independent.  ",3,0,1442928319,1444726054

cv95wqi,1,t3_3ltfma,lightmonkey,"Timing and location are important. You have to be in the right party in the right district. Incumbents are hard to beat, so hopefully when you are ready one is losing popularity and particularly vulnerable or retiring. 

You need a campaign staff, endorsements, and support of local movers and shakers. The best way to get that is to work on campaigns for state, county, and local offices. You'll find that there are certain groups of people that help each other get elected, appointed, or hired. Basically like any job, networking is important. 

Another important aspect is credentials. Service as a state legislator, mayor, or county office are often stepping stones into Congressional office. 

Once you've worked your way up, made friends, and raised money in the right time and place, there are still a bunch of uncontrollable factors. It is certainly less difficult than becoming a Senator or Secretary of Labor, but it isn't easy. ",2,0,1442854102,1444726057
