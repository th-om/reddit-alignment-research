3ne6l4,Did the 2013 shutdown really hurt the GOP,26,revanyo,"I keep hearing that the GOP does not want to revisit 2013 and the negative impacts in had. However, what are those negatives?

The GOP was able to take back the Senate by winning states like Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina, ect. If they had lost it would be a different story, but they won in a big way.

I will acknowledge that the climate and class of 2014 was more in the GOP's favor than it will be in 2016. 

Is there the possibility that a shutdown/PP defundment could help the GOP by rallying the base and maybe persuade some people to challenge  incumbents(Illinois, Wisconsin) and convince others to run in battle states(Colorado, Florida, Nevada,)",38,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ne6l4/did_the_2013_shutdown_really_hurt_the_gop/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443912760,1444719517
