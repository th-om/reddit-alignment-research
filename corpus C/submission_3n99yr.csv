3n99yr,What role does family structure play in mass shootings?,33,WCC335,"This sounds crazy, but it might make for an interesting discussion. I started looking into the backgrounds of many of the recent mass shooters. Many of the high-profile instances of young white males committing mass murder share a common characteristic: the young white male's parents are divorced. 

- Chris Harper Mercer's parents were divorced (recent Oregon shooting)
- Dylann Storm Roof's parents were divorced (Charleston church shooting)
- Elliot Rodger's parents were divorced (Santa Barbara shooting)
- Adam Lanza's parents were divorced (Sandy Hook)

In the interest of providing a counter-point, though, James Holmes' parents were not divorced as far as I can tell. 

Obviously I'm not suggesting that the child of a divorced couple is going to commit mass murder. But doesn't it stand to reason that one's upbringing and home-life will have an effect on behavior/mentality?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3n99yr/what_role_does_family_structure_play_in_mass/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443811438,1444720382
