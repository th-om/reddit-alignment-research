cv9sw7i,1,t3_3lvnyr,ROIB,"The problem with the debt issue is its a long term problem. It's always healthy to carry some debt as leverage for growth. But during the past economic downturn we got a look into the future, where the decline of economic growth, and the ever increasing debt could create serious deficit problems. The interest on our debt is ever increasing and debt service is slowly starting to consume a higher percentage of our yearly budget. Mandatory spending on healthcare (medicare, medicaid) Social Security and social security disability are ever increasing and consuming a higher percentage of the federal budget. When growth slowed down and revenue dropped, it amplified the problem as we simultaneously decreased revenue, increased discretionary spending to try to boost growth, and increased the growth rate of debt service. Now we didn't fall over the edge in the last downturn, but other countries with a higher GDP to Debt ratio did. A couple more tight squeezes could really put a hurting on us. Realistically, a little tinkering on all parts of the equation (some rev increases, some jostling of mandatory and discretionary spending, and a move towards a slightly more aggressive debt service program), the last part being unlikely, could do wonders, but then ideologies get in the way ",10,0,1442890859,1444725600
cva6ego,0,t1_cv9sw7i,yankeesyes,"I don't think the debt is a serious problem, for the reason the OP stated.  Some other factors that may influence it:

1. Old high-interest 30-year bonds from the 80's are being replaced by newer bonds at very low interest.  This hopefully will help keep the interest payments under control.
2. The older population will crest at some point, I'm guessing about 2035, and the resultant demands on entitlements will lessen.  Keep in mind the transfer of wealth to the younger generation could be a catalyst for growth.
3. The deficit has been rapidly shrinking the past few years, and is financed with money bought at zero real interest.",2,0,1442931190,1444725604
cvao06g,0,t1_cva6ego,ROIB,"I agree that at the moment, the debt isn't a serious problem. But the problem with the debt is you don't want to hover near a ratio in which the debt could become a problem, because it can happen quickly. Growth slows down, and you want to increase spending to spur more growth, then you're putting pressure on both sides of the deficit. It would be more of a temporary insolvency problem (although a government can raise funds to get out of a pickle easier than a corporation that goes insolvent), having higher debt just makes this route more expensive. 

We are starting to shed some high interest bonds which slows the growth of debt service. A few of the major programs for the aging population are definitely feeling the pressure of the population bubble, it will level off eventually, but in the mean time it wouldn't hurt to tinker (modest raise of retirement age, phased over a long period of time, I kinda like the Chrisie proposal to raise the retirement age one month per year for 24 years, maybe a little bit of means testing). The deficit is shrinking and being financed well, but interest rates will have to rise soon and growth is a bit anemic still so it will be tricky to balance the interest rates and growth. Can be done, but will likely lead to some fluctuations in the deficit. ",1,0,1442957829,1444725604

This is something people have been claiming for decades. Yet rates have not increased. If the money supply goes up because you borrow money and make more money with that borrowed money then there's no direct correlation to increasing interest rates.

The problem is when you waste borrowed money not when you borrow money.

Think of it this way. If America were to borrow 2 vigintillion dollars tomorrow and with this money invent something that increases the GDP by 300 vigintillion dollars would that be a bad thing?
