3m2q9m,Why Do Muslims Get to Ignore the Same Laws Used to Prosecute Christian Businesses?,15,atomicpete,"The Denver Council’s Business Development Committee has stalled a seven-year deal with Chick-fil-A because CEO Dan Cathy spoke out against gay marriage back in 2012. Cathy, after being flogged for this misconduct, backed off , saying he regretted getting involved. But that won’t do. There are no prisoners in this culture war.

And yet, Muslims are somehow completely immune from being targeted in this culture war even though public accommodation laws demanding you serve people regardless of race, creed, sex, and sexual orientation are clearly being violated.
