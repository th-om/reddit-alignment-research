The tree matters, the apple is more or less disposable.

Society has (in most of the US and EU) come to regard a gestating embryo as of constrained legal relevancy on a sliding scale, as measured by time. I'd like to hear from you, based on your premise that avoiding abortions == saving lives, how far people might be validated to go. For example

(Avoiding aborting a 4 month fetus) == (It is acceptable to execute an abortion doctor at point black with a sawed off shotgun)

>Why can we allow Shiavo to die, but we can't torture a dog. Why is that?

I'm libertarian when it comes to the preservation of your own life. That is an argument that is slightly different from the Shaivo case, but I think if you want to kill yourself (unassisted), then we should at least present the options to you and help to preserve your life. You are the ultimate decision on life though, and if you want to die, you have the right to choose that for yourself.

That's not the issue with the Shaivo case, as she had no ability to make that decision for herself. In that situation, I think we should have done everything we can to preserve life. I know it wasn't much of a life at the time, but the parents were trying to do everything they could (including financially) to preserve her life, and I commend that.

And again, intentional or not, your analogies are pretty shaky. We shouldn't torture or kill any living creature except for those we are using for our consumption, and even then, we've taken strides to try to kill in the most humane way.

>A 6 week old fetus can't consciously suffer.

And when can a fetus feel pain or suffer? Is that your litmus test? I would argue that a fetus **can** feel pain, and there's some [scientific studies that back that claim](http://www.mccl.org/unborn-babies-can-feel-pain.html). Do you think your nerve endings and your brain only develop after you are delivered?

But if ""suffering"" is the only argument you have against extinguishing life, then you could argue that any explosive device I kill someone with is OK because that person instantly is killed and doesn't ""suffer"". If I murder someone by shooting them in the brain causing instant death, that should be legalized. Hopefully I don't get them in the shoulder or abdomen, but if I shoot straight for the heart for instant death, I haven't actually murdered that person. It certainly fits your definition, but would you accept that premise?

Suffering is tangential to the argument that was presented years ago when our founders thought through these types of arguments. Do you have a right to your own life? If so, when does that right begin, who gives you that right, and who protects that right? Our founders said you have a right to life, it is a natural right, and government protects that right. If you believe the government gives you the right to life, then the government can take away that right, and those rules on who has that right and doesn't have that right are controlled by a temporary legislative body that changes its mind depending on which way the wind blows.

What are those dudes doing on death row then? Why do we have people sitting in jail on life sentences for murder? We don't protect life?

Cable TV and internet? Massage parlors and cosmetics? The term ""quality of life"" is completely different no matter where you go in the US or around the world. The term is arbitrary, cannot be enforced, and is not guaranteed in the constitution.

I never said I was smarter, but I certainly have a stronger moral compass than someone who claims killing another person is morally justified if their victim can't feel the pain.

>Are you against the death penalty and our many wars?

I'm a veteran. I believe war is justified only as a last resort. War is hell and can be avoided, but in certain cases, the deaths caused by war save more people than allowing atrocities like genocide to happen unchecked.

I also believe in the death penalty just because these people are the worst of the worst who do not value life at all, and I believe if you have complete disregard for life, you don't deserve your own. It's our duties as humans to protect our fellow humans, and if you have no regard for life, then I'm not opposed to removing yours. I don't believe in the death penalty for anything other than premeditated murder.

I know that might start to sound contradictory in your book, but I don't believe it is. We should protect life, and that's what we have to do when we go to war. The death penalty stance is more about the punishment for killing other humans, but nonetheless, it's still rooted behind the principle of protecting lives.

>You are drawing a arbitrary line in the sand

The line I'm drawing is between a naturally occurring miscarriage aka spontaneous abortion and one caused purposefully.  Clearly it's not always possible to determine if a miscarriage has a natural, accidental, or purposeful cause (just like when someone dies you can't always tell if it was natural or not), but in situations where it could be determined, purposefully causing a miscarriage would be treated the same as having a medically-induced abortion.  Therefore if abortions are illegal, purposefully causing a miscarriage would also be illegal, and if abortions are legal, purposefully causing a miscarriage would also be legal.

>want everyone to have to abide by your own personal moral judgement.

You don't know what my personal moral judgement is, I haven't said yet whether I'm pro-choice or pro-life.

>why do you get to impose your personal moral judgements on everyone else? 

This happens all the time in society.  It's a moral judgement that punching someone in the face is wrong but we have laws that impose this judgement on everyone that say you're not allowed to do this.  You may argue that unlike abortion, punching someone in the face affects another person and not just yourself and that's why punching someone in the face is not allowed but abortion should be.  Of course, people who are pro-life believe a fetus is another person so this argument won't work with someone who is pro-life.

As you said above:

>It is a matter of perspective. I don't view a piece of fetal tissue the same as a living breathing human being. You obviously do. 

Of course it's a matter of perspective that's the whole problem, there's no factual or scientific way to solve this, there's no fixed point where a bundle of cells definitively becomes an entity separate from its mother.  Personally I don't give a shit, I'm fine with everyone getting as many abortions as they want, I really don't care.

Those fertilized eggs that spontaneously abort because there's something biologically wrong with them are no different than someone dying from a genetic disease.  There's no breach of rights, it's a naturally occurring process.  Do you really not see the difference between naturally occurring death (whether it's prenatal or otherwise) and death that is purposefully caused by someone's actions?

I assure you I understand the science, likely better than Bill Nye does given that he's an engineer not a biologist.

“Human life begins at fertilization, the process during which a male gamete or sperm (spermatozoo developmentn) unites with a female gamete or oocyte (ovum) to form a single cell called a zygote.

I see from the GOP a very naive view of abortion, as if all are the same and anyone that supports the right to have one is a monster that enjoys killing babies.  First of all, its a very personal decision.  Something that made me think hard about my own thoughts about it were a series Andrew Sullivan ran on his blog of people that have had to make that choice and their reasons.  Its a horrible place to find yourself and many more factors than you could ever think - http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/threads/its-so-personal/  I can't think of a more personal decision to have the government to have a say.  As for my own thoughs, I have two kids that I love dearly.  If either of those pregnancies were to have been a critical threat to the health of my wife I would have pushed for termination in a heartbeat.  Life is precious, and I would mourn that child, but my wife would come first at that point.  It is a no win decision, and hard to say why other than the experiences that have made my wife are not repeatable, not fair to our other children if it were a second pregnancy to lose their mother, and selfishly I love her and don't want to lose her.

Its also the issue with the GOP that they want abortion illegal, but are not willing to put their wallet where there heart is.  Look at two countries, Sweden and Mexico.  Sweden is much less religious than Mexico. There are no restrictions on abortions in Sweden, it is an illegal procedure in Mexico.  Guess which one has the higher abortion rate.  Mexico.  Sweden however has a social service net that helps their people and supports young families - long maternity leave,  universal health care system, all the things European health care is known for.  Mexico has some, but mostly poor.    In many of these cases it comes down to the money.  Babies are expensive, I have 2 kids - I know.  

If the american right made decisions via facts instead of their gut, and really wanted to bring abortion rates down, the answer is right there.

Of course they can. Until they let a pregnancy get to the point where it could affect another person who has rights. I have no problem with women getting an abortion until after that point, which can be fleshed out by how we understand personhood.

Which forces you to also accept that SOME FUCKING WON'T. It's just statistical. So if we have information on when a brain forms, if we can define a point in which many in society feel as if life begins based on observable facts, then my question to you is why not define it then?

You have repeatedly skirted my personhood question, and there can be no progress if you cannot formulate an answer to the most basic fact at the center of the abortion debate: what characteristic separates a human life from a non human life, and what characteristics necessitate we bestow rights?

If one mother says ""yes this clump of cells is a person"" and another says ""no this clump of cells is not a person"" they cannot simultaneously both be right. A person's rights are completely indifferent to how another person feels about them. The status of personhood cannot be so arbitrarily defined because it's made up of no real actual defining characteristic. If I showed you a picture of a late term fetus and asked you if that was a person you wouldn't be able to answer my question without asking the mother. You have totally skirted my question in favor of a completely subjective viewpoint that has no bearing in reality. Who gives a shit what the mother thinks is a person and is not? Why would this standard be held to any other regard? Oh sorry your honor I killed him because I decided he wasn't a person. Women and mothers don't get to decide what is and is not a person. We as a society need to define what is and is not a person and you're goddamn right I'm comfortable drawing a line and protecting rights from then on. The alternative that you have taken is rooted in nothing but a subjective choice, meaningless, has no actual characteristics outside an arbitrary notion of how a mother feels.

If you let a singular person decide what is and is not a person you will not only get a million different answers, you will get a lot of uninformed answers, you will get a lot of arbitrary answers, and you will above all else get answers influenced by situations.
