3le0t1,The job of the executive branch is to enforce the law. Why are so many opposed to enforcing our immigration laws?,42,jctennis123,"Both Trump and Sanders have talked about stopping illegal immigration. Both have said this hurts low class American workers. Yet if you agree with them you get called a racist. My question is, doesn't the president have an obligation to enforce the laws of this country regarding immigration and why is it considered radical for Trump and Sanders to make these comments? Should Obama be enforcing these laws?

edit: seems like there is a consensus among economist that immigrants help the economy",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3le0t1/the_job_of_the_executive_branch_is_to_enforce_the/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442547610,1444727273
