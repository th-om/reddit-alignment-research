They are very mainstream liberal/progressive positions, however they inconveniently disagree with big money who financially support Democrats. See, Big Money knows how to invest so they spread their bets across Democrats and Republicans that way no matter what they win, you lose. So Hillary is beholden to Wall Street because of a long political history with this reality, to the degree that it's actually ingrained. As one example, the base of the Left wants Wall Street reform and prosecution for wrong-doing, the elite donors don't.

This is similar with Trump. The Republican base doesn't really buy that huge tax cuts for billionaires solve all ills, but that is a required position to receive political donations from the Republican elite. This is ingrained in people like Jeb!, but for Trump, he doesn't need to appeal to the elite, just the base, because he's self-financing. 

I think a Sanders v. Trump election would be a really great demonstration of democracy-- they both represent the bases, not the elites, and it could transform our political system once dominated by elites through money, ads, and corporate media ownership.

>They are very mainstream liberal/progressive positions

Liberal or progressive, maybe. Mainstream, no, they are not. You're confusing the political clout (elitism as you put it) of a politician with their stances on issues, which is what determines how mainstream a candidate actually is. 

The majority of Democrats are center-left; the majority of Republicans are center-right. The candidate that is most center-left and the most center-right is going to be seen as being the most mainstream for each party, regardless of where their money or influence comes from. This is why Hillary and Jeb are seen as mainstream candidates; the majority of both parties identifies more with them than they do with fringe candidates like Sanders and Trump (although to a lesser extent with the latter.)

Also, the notion that Democrats would be a ""center-right"" party in Europe is pretty silly.

I guarantee you that the actual people who manage computer security were asking that they step up their security and those who were actually in charge either ignored their warnings or flat out said no. Where there is big government there is a big bureaucratic nightmare. You can point to other nations (one of the popular choices are the Scandinavian countries) were these leftist proposals work but they have a completely different mindset and practice things such a as free trade which the US left opposes.
