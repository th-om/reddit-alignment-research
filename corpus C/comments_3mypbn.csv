cvkyxmb,0,t1_cvk1tm5,Weaselbane,"I think he would have had an administration that reacted very differently to 9/11. His military background and experience on the Armed Forces committee would probably have kept the US out of Iraq while focusing on Afghanistan.

He also had good credentials at the time for being able to work bipartisan legislation, and had at least some desire for fiscal responsibility.

Lastly, his work on McCain-Feingold showed a strong desire to slow special interests in the election process.

So, I believe he would have been a president who focused on the real threat, would have tried to maintain some financial responsibility, and worked to reform the election process. I also believe he would have been fairly effective in foreign policy, but I don't have a lot of reasons for that.


As I write this I realized that I would prefer him over any announced candidate in either party right now :)

The sad thing is, if he had handled it like Donald Trump and fought back, perhaps even embraced it, it wouldn't have been so damaging. It was a trivial thing. Dean's problem was the way he responded. When you get attacked for something so trivial, you don't apologize, you double down, and counter attack. You make the attack look like a hit job by an unfair opponent, especially when its ridiculous attacks on something like a scream or personality quirk. True, this wasn't the only thing that contributed to his failure in the 04 primary, but the media really went on the attack mode for the establishment in this case. 

Compare and contrast that with trump: The media is constantly attacking him. Things that would have sunk other candidates have done nothing to trump, because not only are many of the attacks were just bs designed to take him down, but he handled them by embracing them, and thereby amplifying them, to the point where any of the attacks looked ridiculous to the average voter watching and had no effect.
