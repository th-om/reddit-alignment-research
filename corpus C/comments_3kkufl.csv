I thought the most telling thing from the interview was that Bush refused to bash Obama. That's something that someone who is thinking about the general election does. I've seen him do that before, and it speaks to his confidence. We can all say that his confidence is misplaced, but he has more information than we do, and the people who are putting their money where their mouth is agree with him.

We'll see how the markets change between now and Iowa. I expect Rubio to climb from 14% as Hilary's victory becomes even more eminent ([71% at this point](http://www.predictwise.com/politics/2016DemNomination)). With Hilary running for the Dems, it'll be hard for the GOP to pass up an opportunity to cash in on the ""Not another Clinton/Bush"" vote. Rubio is also someone who is clearly looking ahead, as evidenced by his comments in the debate where he said that if it's a resume competition, Hilary will win.

Agreed. It does seem like it will hurt him in the primaries though, since GOP is so crazy anti-obama and I am sure they want a politician to echo that sentiment very loudly. Maybe he is going after the middle too early. Or just playing to the middle on large nation shows. Whereas on Fox News he could be more vicious in his attacks on the president. 

>it'll be hard for the GOP to pass up an opportunity to cash in on the ""Not another Clinton/Bush"" vote.

This was before he had even declared his intention to run. Joe Lieberman was another speaker at the event, so I'm not entirely sure how conservative of a crowd it was, but it was very interesting to see at the time.

I'm not sure if it's a *good* strategy for the primary, but it's definitely a confident one. It's also a rare anti-establishment strategy he uses. I'd guess that his establishment support is the very reason he has the confidence to have that attitude during the primary. 

This early on, I'm looking for candidates who aren't looking like they're trying too hard. Those are the guys who will have staying power and won't burn out. Rubio and Bush are the two who appear to me to be playing the long game, and I can't stress enough how important I think it is to remember that this is an instance of asymmetric information.
