3lxtaz,"Whats wrong with saying a muslim running for president, has to categorically reject the illiberal parts of their faith, to get your personal vote?",33,CarolinaPunk,"Would you consider voting for a muslim candidate, who is pro life, against gay marriage, or against any of the other secular traditional liberal positions?

If your answer is no, you agree with Ben Carson.

Ben Carson did not call for a law to stop a muslim running for president, but for them to reject, just a Kennedy did the Pope authority from the Caliphate. Before they would be someone he or anyone should or could vote for. 

It is a secular position. 

Or another way
