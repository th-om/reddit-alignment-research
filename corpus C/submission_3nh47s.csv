3nh47s,Is the second amendment still relevant in today's society?,54,attosama,"I believe the 2nd amendment is outdated and no longer reflects today's society. When the law was created semi automatic weapons that could be concealed did not exist. Someone couldn't walk into a theatre and kill 50 people at a time. We need to decide what living in the 21st century means, and if the right to bare weapons is still beneficial to society's safety as a whole. Keep in mind this law was created during a time period where our government was still fresh, States were governed separately, and did not have today's military might. 

I would argue semi automatic at the very least should be banned, this is over kill and certainly not necessary to defend a home. Large hunting rifles and weapons designed for hunting I am okay with, thus is not a weapon that can be concealed and carried into public. 

Mental health while it certainly is am issue worth exploring does not help in this argument. Most of these mass shootings have occurred when a white teen obtained a semi automatic legally from their own house hold. We can not predict every person's action, but we can limit their access to dangerous tools. 

We should not need to live in a society where every teacher, theatre employee, security guard needs a gun to maintain the peace.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nh47s/is_the_second_amendment_still_relevant_in_todays/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443981634,1444718920
