Iraq participated in wars with Israel in 1948, 1967, and 1973, and Israel contributed missile strikes to the US's first war with Iraq in 1991. Technically, they were at war from Israel's formation in 1948 until the dissolution of the Iraqi government in 2003.

Moreover, Hussein was a pro-Palestenian voice in the region.

Even the resulting power vacuum and rise of ISIS has been a short-term positive for Israel, rendering some of their other long-term enemies occupied by Sunni/Shia conflict and unable to pay attention to the Israel/Palestine situation or offer assistance to Hamas.

> And in regards to Cheney and Halliburton, is it true that he basically profited directly from the contracts Haliburton got for the second Iraq war?

Cheney cut most of his financial ties to Halliburton upon taking office (at an all-time high for Halliburton's stock, coincidentally), but he still had 433,333 shares of Halliburton stock in the form of stock options which vested after he took office. Halliburton's stock rose from a historic low of $7/share in early 2002 to a historic high of over $70/share by 2005, and Cheney did exercise those options to cash out several million dollars (which he immediately donated to charity). Halliburton also continued to pay out salary to Cheney, deferred from his time as CEO, several years after he took office as VP.",1,0,1442604241,1444727614
