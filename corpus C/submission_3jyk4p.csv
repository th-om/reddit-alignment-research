3jyk4p,Can GOP be socially moderate and not be called a RINO? Has anyone like that won? Ever?,67,The_seph_i_am,"I recently posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3jtmar/why_is_john_kasich_seen_as_a_moderate_and_why_are/cuse1aw) comment to a question here on r/politics.  And it got me wondering, has any  GOP candidate been socially moderate without being called a RINO?

And when was the last time anyone like that won an election?  If ever?",37,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3jyk4p/can_gop_be_socially_moderate_and_not_be_called_a/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441622956,1444731960
