That's really just a manufactured controversy created by some pretty deceitfully cut videos.  Ben Carson used fetal tissue samples.  It's an emotional argument that fetal tissue is a bad thing, a lot of good science and life saving medicine is backed by fetal tissue research.

I think a lot of people have misconceptions about what planned parenthood does.  It performs very few abortions.  It provides prophylactics and reproductive health (cancers, stis) services that have HUGE social benefit.  I'm all for the free market, but the market can't account for the social cost of unwanted pregnancies or sti's or the loss of value from women whose cancers would otherwise go undiscovered.

Other than the general health services that help mitigate some extreme social costs, planned parenthood in some places is the only option for an abortion in literally hundreds of miles.  When state and local legislation stands in the way of abortion clinics (i.e. interferes with the market), planned parenthood is necessary in order to make that service available.",9,0,1441813490,1444731360

No, it's founding was not illustrious but I don't see how that matters with regard to the modern organization. If the modern KKK went around donating toys to children's hospitals and opening up soup kitchens in low income neighborhoods and serving everyone regardless of race I'd be supporting them too.

An organization's founder and original purpose are irrelevant if the modern organization does not carry on that legacy and to this point I see no indication that Planned Parenthood does this in any way. 

As far as it's purpose, as I mentioned it's something that we'd feel the impact of pretty severely if it were to disappear. Planned Parenthood provides family planning to many people who otherwise couldn't afford it as well as sexual and women's health services that are otherwise out of reach of many people.

What happens when that service suddenly isn't there and people are left with little to no support? You start seeing more births to low-income families, a greater proliferation of STI's among people who used Planned Parenthood previously which then starts to filter into the rest of the population. Women are deprived of critical health services they may not otherwise be able to afford, increasing the burden on an already crumbling emergency healthcare system as minor problems become serious ones without care. 

Worst of all you deprive people of a resource for education about how to make better choices with regards to personal and sexual health.

That's a cute bumper sticker but when the rubber meets the road (or the genitals) and you need help, Planned Parenthood will help you and it's often the only avenue open to people who are otherwise unable to get much help.

Closing it off means an increased burden on other support systems which are already strained; you don't save money by shutting down the program, you move the costs around.

I would highly encourage you to visit a Planned Parenthood and get an STI screening. They're extremely inexpensive (and if you're sexually active you should probably get one regularly anyways) or free if you're low income and you can see how the program works firsthand.",15,0,1441776237,1444731360

That's fine if that's what you believe but the practical application of the idea does not bear out in the real world. The type of service Planned Parenthood is means it's going to operate at a loss because the people it serves are unable to pay for the care in the first place.

Your idea of self-sufficiency is too narrow because it misses the fact that Planned Parenthood does run at a loss and therefore requires federal funding *however* that funding is repaid by future costs that are averted.

Say it costs $100 for one appointment for one low income person to come in and get an STI screening, family planning consultation, and birth control. That person can't pay $100 so the state has to kick it in. If you stop there then it looks like a waste of money. But then once you step back you realize that that $100 spent means that that one person likely won't get pregnant or catch an STI, both of which require medical attention and pose a health risk to the community. Now they can't afford this medical care so the hospital that treats them in the ER is going to have to swallow the costs which means the government has to pick up most of the tab.

So now instead of $100 the government has to pay out $10,000 for a live birth or several thousand dollars over the course of years for treatments for an STI like Hep C or HIV. 

Now you could say ""well then we just won't cover *anything* and we'll save money!"" Except you'll still have to spend money elsewhere. People who are in poverty often take up more law enforcement resources, which the state has to pay for, and they're not paying taxes because they either make too little or they aren't employed.

Yes, but the pricing and selling of these tissue is in somewhat of a gray area, and that is where the controversy lies. Some sell for less than a $100 and other vials of cells can fetch thousands. Donated fetal tissue for research is more than fine to me. If there is a way to progress from something as gloomy as an abortion, I welcome it.

(Not that I am a 'pro-lifer', I have stated this is a NEEDED procedure that demands it to be accessible anywhere in this country, but this is not a happy issue.) Do I have an alternate solution, absolutely not. My instinct is to give public foundations the pathway and leniency at both the state and federal level to make successful non-profits that would fill the public need in place of PP. US Govt does some things right, but it seems like programs that benefit society often do the worst, due to politic. Organizations like PP then become held at the neck by politicians deciding how much funding they will be able to receive from taxpayers, or whether they will even be legal. That is where the controversy really comes in to play here, because they do have to consider over-pricing for tissue to make profit, due to the lack of funding it receives. Is it crazy to think that citizens can do better, when faulty Govt social programs don't work plainly truthfully?

I also question whether it is fair for someone who remarks on this pricing of tissue and how it is controversial, to be someone who resents abortion. Not you in particular, but in the media. There have been many instances lately where I have found myself right in the middle of combating viewpoints, and the truest answer lies right between them. For instance, can I listen to what Trump has to say about wealth distribution, agree, and still not be xenophobic? Or (and I know Reddit is gonna get really, really mad, but it needs to be said) can I support people who call for cleaner, more transparent vaccines, support some vaccination programs, and not be ""anti-vaxx""? (This is just an example of my opinion, and irrelevant to this particular post, so please post about this elsewhere if you're angry) Finding solutions in todays arguments is essential to where we will end up as a society, but so many times it is Red v.

Incorrect. The tissue is sold essentially ""at cost."" Whatever costs Planned Parenthood incurs in storing and transporting the tissue to the researchers is what they are paid. Planned Parenthood is not making a profit off this, they are negating costs for donated material.

>Some sell for less than a $100 and other vials of cells can fetch thousands.

>Anyone who believes that this is not an issue that should cause discomfort, either emotionally or physically, doesn't share the respect for life that I do.

As I pointed out, the practical difference between organ and tissue donation of dead people (which is is almost universally considered to be a laudable, noble thing to do) and the donation of the tissue of a dead fetus to research is zero.

The only reason there's an emotional hangup about this is because one has been artificially inserted by opponents of abortion.

>what PP is doing for this country.

They do nothing that isn't covered by everyone's health insurance now, period.  There's nothing ""special"" about them anymore.  So, no, there isn't a ""big difference.""

The bottom line is this.  You seem to have health insurance.  This means you have income, a job, or something like that.  So hypothetically you are not a vulnerable member of society.

PP is for vulnerable members of society.  Womens who husband cheat on them, then rape them later.  And shit like that.  We should be paying PP 3x as much just to keep the doors open.  One of my best friends lives was basically saved by PP.  Her husband use to rape her, a lot.  Husband rape is pretty common in texas apparently, because she's not the only girl I know this has happened to.  These are well educated white women from decent middle class families.  Can you imagine what the mexican spanish speaking illegals who use PP have been through?  But they do far more than this.

The only people who talk shit about PP are people who dont understand what they do.  I cant have a civil conversation with you on this because I know what it does and how it changes lives.  It's not just another fucking clinic.

I'm sorry you are ill, I hope your recovery is going well.  When I was 18 my best friend had serious emergency brain surgery.  Changed her life completely.  Sadly she never recovered.  I sat by her bedside in the hospital almost every day for a month or so.  Ended up losing my job over it.

You are talking to someone who's 35 with crushing mental illness, major dental problems, and a hernia.  I can't afford Obamacare.  There is no support network for me.  The hernia alone might be over $10k.  My health insurance plan is dont get sick, and exercise.  This weekend I took a decent fall on my bicycle, luckily I wasnt hurt badly.  The city decided on a corner was a good place for a pile of sand.  Always wear your helmet boys and girls.  So when I hear someone insured bitching about PP, which is literally saving lives - it rubs me the wrong way.  The last time I had insurance was 2009 and I paid $500 a month for the privilege of being healthy.  So your MRI bill was 2 months worth of me being healthy with insurance.

Sorry again for being a dick - this issue is way too close to home for me.  I know so many women who have been raped /abused / etc.  And PP is a haven for people like that.  After being raped you dont then have to go to your elderly christian conservative male dr *who also thinks PP should be shut down* for a check up.  You'd want to go somewhere with no judgement.  No sideways glances from the nurses.  You're already in one of lifes more horrible positions.",6,0,1441784559,1444731360

Actually it's ""government grants and contracts"" which also includes medicaid payments that come from the state and federal level for services rendered.

There are also state and local grants that are included in that number, and should be address at a state and local level.",1,0,1441803265,1444731360
