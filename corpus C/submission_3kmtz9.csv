3kmtz9,14th anniversary of you know what. Gotta talk about it.,39,kirkisartist,"911 changed everybody's world view. I remember only 2% opposed going into Afghanistan or the Patriot Act. So please don't revise your opinion. Nobody thought twice until well *after* we had invaded Iraq.

My immediate reaction was just as bad as anybody's. It only seemed logical that it was push back from Saddam Hussein. It didn't seem like allot to ask to give the NSA, CIA and FBI warrantless access to everybody's records and open torture centers like Gitmo and Abu Graheib with no due process or transparency. I figured we might as well just jack the middle east for their oil just to show them who's boss.

But I had allot of incredibly insightful liberal friends at the time. They really changed my mind when they brought up the Bush/Bin Laden family connection through the Carlyle Group, the fact we gave Hussein WMDs and the fact we funded the Taliban when they were fighting the commies. It became clear that this was a business, the public was the customer and 9-11 was an advertisement. Sales went through the roof.

I'm not saying jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams. But I am saying that Al-Qaeda and ISIS are a product of the US Military Industrial Complex. Same as velcro, microwaves, tin cans and silicon transistors. Maybe they're no longer associated but their foundation was subsidized by the US tax payer in the name of defending the nation.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kmtz9/14th_anniversary_of_you_know_what_gotta_talk/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442034927,1444729799
