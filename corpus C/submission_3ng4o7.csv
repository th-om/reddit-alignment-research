3ng4o7,Can someone help me understand the Republican Party?,218,zascar,"This is a serious question - I'm genuinely trying to understand it because right now it's just baffling to me. Now firstly, I'm not from the US, I've only taken a strong interest in US politics recently. No doubt my media sources (mostly Reddit)  have a strong left bias, but even when I try take a moderate and unbiased stance, I still don't get it. But there must be a lot I'm just not seeing or something I don't understand so I'm here to ask Reddit to explain it to me. Why would anyone vote Republican considering the constant barrage of crazy things the party does and seems to stand for?

I really like Bernie Sanders. I love watching Bill Maher, Jon Stewart, Colbert, John Oliver, etc most of who rip on republicans constantly. In fact everyone does! So much so it makes the party appear like a joke to me! It's gone completely right wing extremist. The lies and hypocrisy from the Republican party is just staggering. The Democrats are not innocent but it seems 20 times works from the GOP.

I wonder do they actually believe some of the things they say or are they just 100% committed to the lies? I'm talking about things like denying climate change, Trickle down economics, more tax breaks for the rich, Trumps recent racist antics & Blaming Obama for everything. I find it hard to understand why they would not want to live in a world where we take care of people, and not want to scrap Obamacare, Medicare, Medicare and the minimum wage? Cutting education programs while Scott Walker gives $500m to build a stadium? Being funded by the Koch brothers who are like real life cartoon supervillains? Gun Control, defunding planned parenthood, Pro War, I could go on and on...

I'm sorry if I sound totally once sided and uninformed - maybe I am. I read people like Paul krugman, Robert Reich and Noam Chompski who seems like very smart people to me - all making a mockery of Republicans constantly. I don't see the same calibre of people fighting on the side of the GOP. As I said, I'm not from the US and you'll tell me I have a warped view - but I really don't see much of the good side at all. Can anyone fill me in? What am I missing? I understand the GOP have control of the house and the senate - which is why we have nothing but political gridlock - but I just cant understand how despite all this craziness they have so much support? Can anyone explain it to me?

Republicans, why do you vote Republican? How can you side with a party with so many terrible stances - or do you agree with them all? I'm not trying to be flippant I am genuinely trying to understand it.
