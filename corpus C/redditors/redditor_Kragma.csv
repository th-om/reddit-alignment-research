cvleeq5,0,t1_cvl9j4j,Kragma,">People who wish to conceal carry should undergo the same training law enforcement personnel undergo. 

Meaningless in the context of this shooting. Schools are gun free zones so concealed carry doesn't enter into it at all. Also if you've ever been present at a police qualifying, their shooting skills are often surprisingly poor, or at least as poor as a random person off the street who doesn't shoot. Police aren't often trained to be marksmen.

>If you have been treated for mood disorders or more serious psychiatric disorders, a mental health professional should have to sign off on your gun license for you to possess a firearm legally. 

Discourages seeking help for mental health in the most perverse way. A gun owner who's dealing with depression and anger after a divorce/job loss/other hardship is not going to seek help for it if means surrendering his guns. The common suggestion that this should be the case probably already discourages seeking help and I think that's just a horrible outcome. Punishing people who seek help is just stupid.

>The aggregate costs of treating uninsured shooting victims should be borne by ammunition makers as an added surcharge. Each bullet made will cost a penny more.

I think there's actually a law prohibiting exactly this sort of thing and shielding companies somewhat. Otherwise there probably wouldn't be a gun maker left in the country, having been buried under lawsuits. This was once the stated goal of gun control groups. We don't hold car companies responsible for drunk drivers, but more people die in car crashes than mass shootings by a pretty wide margin.",0,0,1443761519,1444731862

Probably spells the end of passenger diesels in the US (again), which is unfortunate, but I think with direct injected turbocharged gasoline engines becoming more common, diesel is losing a bit of its luster anyway.",1,0,1442898910,1444731862

There's an assumption that if you're buying a firearm you know how to use it safely. Just like a car dealership is unlikely to ask if you know how to drive.
