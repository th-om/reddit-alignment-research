cvxagjj,1,t3_3ohngw,Fatt_Rascal,"IMO the value of a bike like that will depend pretty heavily on the condition & age of the components... How is the bottom bracket? Hubs? Cassette/chain/derailleurs? Head? Cables? - etc. If that stuff is rusted/worn/loose, you're looking at a $250-400 bike IMO. If it's all in tip-top shape, then maybe it's a $500-600 bike.

Good luck!",3,0,1444680126,1444722803
cvwksna,0,t1_cvwk7aw,Fatt_Rascal,"It really was a great comeback. For about the first 15 minutes, I had giant smash after giant smash, requiring constant pit tows. I ended up on my roof (tow), side (tow), and even landed on top of one of those dirt mounds and got stuck there (another tow). We were many laps down, maybe 10 or so? Not sure. It seemed like the entire field was out to get me! But, finally was able to start doing some laps and then the team really came together with a common goal of annihilating Sven. Well done.",4,0,1444621275,1444722803
