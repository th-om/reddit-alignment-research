cvqr6hi,0,t1_cvqqfe4,benjamoo,"Oh duh, I totally forgot about the coaching change. But that just makes him riskier because we don't know what will change.",1,0,1444178355,1444725924
cvqqsb3,0,t1_cvqq8hz,benjamoo,"Gurley has a lot more upside, but may be more of a risk since he's only played one game. I'd do it.",1,0,1444177695,1444725924
cvqqo4i,0,t1_cvqq9jd,benjamoo,"Absolutely do that. Reed is injury prone, and when will you ever start him when you have Gronk (who is past his bye)? Moncrief has been pretty solid and could probably start for you a lot of weeks.",2,0,1444177494,1444725924
cvqqke2,1,t3_3nqi4c,benjamoo,"I was offered Cam Newton for Lamar Miller in a 12 man, standard scoring league. Do I take it? 

Background: I had Romo and then picked up Tyrod Taylor when he got injured, but I really want a safer QB. But RB is pretty thin for me too. I have AP, Gio and Woodhead in addition to Miller.",1,0,1444177315,1444725924
cvqqch1,1,t3_3nrwcg,benjamoo,Is there some news that said he'll get more touches or something? I have him on my team and was just offered a trade for him. Is it just that the schedule is getting easier after the bye?,1,0,1444176936,1444725924
cvh3d26,0,t1_cvgzo7m,benjamoo,"It's just that the rule doesn't align with common sense. I mean look at the play - most people would say he caught the ball (not by the NFL's definition, but just by the common sense understanding of what a ""catch"" is). I mean he caught the ball, held onto it with both hands, reached across the goal line while he was falling, and then the ball fell out of his hand when it hit a defender's foot. I understand that he didn't maintain possession all the way to the ground, but he did touch both feet down and clearly have possession of the ball. I think it's a dumb rule.",0,0,1443462037,1444725924
cvbhqz6,0,t1_cvbgqgl,benjamoo,I have both of them too. Are you starting either/both of them against the Titans?,1,0,1443025770,1444725924
cva9lpf,0,t1_cva2j1k,benjamoo,"I'm in the same boat unfortunately. I put claims on Dalton and Taylor, but can't decide on the order. I think Taylor has the better schedule but Dalton is more consistent.",1,0,1442936465,1444725924
