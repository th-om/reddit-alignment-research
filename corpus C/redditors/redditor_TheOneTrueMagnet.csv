1) Domestic Violence Reform

I shouldn't be able to be thrown in jail at whim with no evidence.

2) Co-Ownership of Children

I need at least a 50% stake in the children, otherwise what is the point in risking marriage? If there are two children, I should by default get one.",1,0,1444166513,1444724550

These are what you need to understand:

 * Science never proves anything. It only narrows the window.
 * The scientific method cannot be applied to all knowledge.
 * Calling everyone who disagrees with you a heretic before the God of Science makes you look pathetic to people who actually understand science.

cvczrog,0,t1_cvczmct,TheOneTrueMagnet,I know. That is why I quoted their article on the poll. The last sentence says that 5% of scientists hold a young earth view creationist view. It was in answer to your previous post asking for scientists with YEC views.,2,0,1443127457,1444724550

[While this 40% is a middle ground of agreement between scientists and the public, there is a sharp polarization between the groups taking purely naturalistic or biblical views. While most scientists are atheistic about human origins, nearly half of Americans adhere to the biblical view that God created humans ""pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10 000 years."" Forty-six percent of Americans agreed with this view of human origins in the 1991 Gallup poll. Only 5 percent of the scientists agreed.](http://ncse.com/rncse/17/6/many-scientists-see-gods-hand-evolution)",1,0,1443126527,1444724550

cvcymhw,0,t1_cvcy8fn,TheOneTrueMagnet,"There are leading researchers in sciences and everywhere who have differing opinions on origins, including different varieties on creationism. Science literally cannot disprove the those theories because they lie outside the purview of it.
