cvxqepg,1,t3_3nkp47,berlinbrown,"I guess it depends on what we are talking about.  First, I think we need to identify ""conservatives"".  Personally, I think a conservative doesn't not always equate to Republican.  Not all Republicans are conservative.   I think Donald Trump, Rand Paul and Mitt Romney don't seem like a traditional conservative Republicans.   I would just think of them of as Republicans.

So then, what is a conservative in America?  I would consider Sean Hannity, Anne Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, George Bush, Mike Huckabee ""conservative Republicans"" or just conservatives.  They espouse Christian Conservative values.  They will mention God and Country and America is the leader of the free world.  They have strong anti-abortion stances.    They feel that there is a war on Christian Americans (see the attacks on Christmas).  And they are behind the pushes to attack Planned Parenthood.    Politically, they are pushing for stronger states rights (see the recent Religious Freedom acts in Indiana), strong defense, strong support of Israel.  That is how I see a conservative political leaning person.

...    

With that said, I don't mind if people are religious, but I find issue with closely tying religion to  politics.  Liberals don't tend to do that.   So that, right off that bat, is going to create automatic friction between liberals and conservatives.   So, I am going to have to agree with liberals on this, we shouldn't arbitrarily associate religious moral values with political issues and the law.  With Planned Parenthood, the debate should be framed, ""should the federal government fund these types of programs?"".  To me, that is a valid debate, just like the discussion on the funding for any federal program.

With the recent gay marriage debate and the Supreme Courts' recent actions.  And I am looking at Kim Davis.  So I guess the argument I have heard a lot from conservatives, ""The Bible says that man should not lie with another man"".   So once again, I wish conservatives wouldn't tie religion to that issue either.  There may be an argument that individual states should be able to adopt their own laws as it relates marriage.   But quoting scripture shouldn't appear in the states right's argument.

Many of the issues favored by conservatives could be looked at it from a purely legal or constitutional standpoint, but liberals or other groups should not put up with a  purely religious argument.  They are typically irrational and unscientific, so a logical debate can't possibly follow.  

Some liberals are wrong when they just throw out that all conservatives are racist.  That isn't really an argument, so they should stop with that rhetoric.   And cuts to US government programs isn't inherently racist or a blow to civil rights or the women's  issues.  The US government has a 3 trillion+ dollar budget.  Are we saying programs can't be cut, sometimes those programs don't work.  Sometimes they are just unconstitutional.",1,0,1444704725,1444720792
cvxpnmu,1,t3_3oiym9,berlinbrown,"I don't have any research on this but just on my observations,  I think Hollywood is equally racist to people of color (non white).  So maybe your research could also be tied into representation of Latinos as  well.   But maybe culturally Latinos haven't been as outspoken on discrimination as the black community.  When you think of civil rights issues and discrimination in the workplace, you hear about Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, the top Latino civil rights leaders may not have as much attention put on them or issues in the Latino community.  

Here are some top Latino actors, you might research their story, Andy Garcia, John Leguizamo, Jennifer Lopez, Michael Pena, Benicio del Toro

But I had some general comments about race in Hollywood in general.  Like a lot of people, I enjoy TV and movies and always perplexed at how little your see people of different races represented.   We heard from two different star directors that said they wouldn't get funded or the big movies wouldn't sell in foreign markets if they had a mixed cast, this is from George Lucas and Ridley Scott.  But the interesting thing for me, but when do you see  a ""mixed cast"" in any top movie?  You could name any movie of the week and the cast and predominantly white.  The Martian (Matt Damon), The Intern (Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro).   You see an occasional black role, not in the main actor/actress and not in the secondary cast but some random extras role.    And they always set these films in two or three locations, New York or LA or SF.  And somehow there are no black people ever around to get focus.  My take on SF and LA.  SF had a very strong Asian community, Japanese, Chinese, Korean...everywhere.  Hanging out in Mission District (my fav spot), you get a real cool diverse vibe from the city.  But that isn't necessarily represented in film.  And NYC we know has its diversity.   And you have the TV show Girls TV show, a show about female New Yorkers...relatively few minorities shown (as one example).

And I kind of wonder, why?  It seems bizarre for our artists to focus on this one particular group which doesn't necessarily represent America.  And even if the art doesn't represent America, try it out, mix up the diversity in film.

And that is where the hypocrisy lies (not on the teacher but the government),  it isn't necessarily that these substances are harmful to self or someone creating some health epidemic, it is just that they are illegal and some people will go to jail and some won't.  I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of teachers do drugs.  Or hell, maybe cops and prosecutors.  We have seen that DEA agents were caught using drugs and stealing guns, yet didn't receive reprimands.

cvxhpss,1,t3_3ogd1o,berlinbrown,"I haven't read the entire article and will get back to it.  But are we ready to start profiling people?  People that are sad and lonely...equates to mass murder in schools?    With the Oregon shooter, maybe there wasn't a statistic or profile that could identified him as a potential killer.  For example, has he committed a crime before?

I think America, in general seems to be a pretty violent place at least based on the numbers.  Shouldn't we profile the gang bangers and those that are repeat offenders of violent crimes.
