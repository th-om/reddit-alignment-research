But by-golly you got a Comcast connection.  

Dude, lets call it what it is... your ancestors were fought and defeated. Your people lost. Welcome to America.  You can join in, or you can stay on the reservation trying to relive the ""good ol' days"".  But don't get all Palestine on us. Your people were weak, while Europeans turned this into the most prosperous nation on earth.  We have sent men to the moon, probed the edges of the solar system, and have seen the bounds of the universe.  The list goes on.  Its called progress.  What laws did your peoples have to ensure the equal treatment of women and children?  What cancer centers did they go to?  What microprocessor did they invent? All that came from elsewhere.

Your ""culture"" is dead.  The new culture is modern America.  All the way down to your MacBook Pro that you wrote that with.  Don't feel bad though.  Your people got us good with that tobacco thing. Still killing us.",-5,0,1444715053,1444726044

I just don't see how any of these bans are even remotely legal.  I'm no fan of guns, but short of disarming everyone in America (which will never happen), *bans are not a solution*. The left is na√Øve to think that bans will stop this craziness, and I'm disappointed (once again) in our president (and this governor) for simplifying the issue in such a manner.  This is a multi-faceted problem and just looking at the gun portion is a waste of time.  Has anyone done a study on these serial killers to understand what exactly is their major malfunction?  That's the issue that needs to be tackled.  How do we find these people and deal with them long before it ever gets to a mass shooting?  Those of you in Europe who take pride in the lesser amount of mass violence:  Forget the guns - what is it about Europe in general that America lacks? (being serious here).  Better mental health facilities?  Less social isolation?  Are people more open about their problems?  

One correlation I have noticed is that these people are always just looking to take out as many innocent people as possible.  I don't recall a serial killer going after people we don't care for (for instance, Westboro Baptist Church).  They are suicidal people who want to make a name for themselves and be noticed as they check out. They plan and collect the items they need in isolation.  They seem to know quite a bit more about weaponry and tactics than most ordinary people.  Religious views may be a factor.  They seem to predominantly be young males - white?  (I don't recall a black mass shooter, but I could be wrong).  Are they drug users?  What else do we know about them?  

While this debate rages on, and people protest this or that...the next shooter is preparing.",14,0,1444568802,1444726044
