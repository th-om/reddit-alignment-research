cvcmnp5,0,t1_cvat0c6,williamploger,"Calm down there. I was asking for clarification of what you said, that he had full support of Congress through his entire term. And for the record, Mitch McConnell was QUOTED as saying the Republican number one goal was to get Obama not re-elected. I am not sure which straw man argument I was creating there, unless you were not responding to me?",1,0,1443108292,1444729250
cv4o7ye,1,t3_3l8e7w,williamploger,"Having gone from a waterfall to a more Agile process, our quality went up, morale went up, and we were on time more ofthen with more bugs fixed and features delivered. The key is to have a STRONG scrum master or project manager. If the team allows the product manager to bully it, guess what, you no longer have an agile TEAM. It works the other way too, if the dev team is running roughshod over the product manager, you no longer have an agile team either. All the things listed in the article are examples of a dysfunctional COMPANY not a dysfunctional agile team. If everyone is doing the job that was assigned to them (by the self organizing team) you will have better results. There is no silver bullet either. Agile is a guide, your team needs to reflect and adjust to make your process work for your team WITH measurements.  (Edits)",4,0,1442498646,1444729250

cv13fi0,1,t3_3kvgrf,williamploger,"Obama's biggest issue as president is he did not move Congress. The Republican congress decided it did not want to govern and it didn't want Obama to govern either. However, I think even with a somewhat more amiable Congress, Obama is still a C to B- grade in our history of Presidents. Not good, not bad. Did his job with dignity and honor. That's not bad, but its' not TR, FDR, Washington, Eisenhower or Lincoln stratosphere either. And of course, time will change our outlook of his term. Oh and in 2008, I thought he was the best choice out of the field we had. I didn't drink the Kool-Aid, it was more, 'This guy isn't evil and he makes a nice speech which is better than I can say for the rest of these people.'",6,0,1442236716,1444729250

I don't have raw numbers to say with a fact that my perception was reality. However, I have been really happy with VMWare, so I guess that counts. Yes, both solutions will use up battery. I tend to stay plugged in most of the time, so keep that in mind.",1,0,1441748509,1444729250
