cvx8avh,0,t1_cvwub9d,FranticOne,Yes that's how it should work.  Citizens should be involved through their representatives in Congress.  But congress has stopped representing citizens.  So how can we get involved?  Protests the only way.,1,0,1444677040,1444727804
cvwlcee,0,t1_cvwl5y2,FranticOne,"Our representatives are not negotiating this.  They passed the fast track for Obama, this keeps any of our representatives from having any input.  They have final say, yes or no, but had no seat at the negotiations.  If you meant Obama, he is not the legislative branch and cannot represent us in this regard.",1,0,1444622362,1444727804
cvwgd4v,0,t1_cvwejay,FranticOne,"(From the CDC statistics)3,932,181 people are born each year in the United States with a total of 2,596,993 deaths.  Net gain of : 1,335,188.  In 2013, 990,553 foreign nationals became lawful permanent resident.  The illegal immigrant population has remained stable recently, and means the deportations and illegal immigrants entering per year roughly balance out, net zero.  A total yearly increase of 2,325,741.  The number of immigrants is actually 43%.  So that effect cannot be ignored.  So I was way off there on the %.  

I must be reading something wrong in the numbers, but it shows more increase from birth than immigration.  Maybe if I knew the % of immigrants in those birth numbers that would account for the rest.

cvwdnb5,0,t1_cvw28xp,FranticOne,"The U.S. population increases due to (Birth Rate - Death Rate) every day, much faster than any immigration, including illegal.  Whatever effect immigration has would be a .000001% blip.

The non-fatal crimes have dropped further than the homicides.  Meaning that the crimes are actually more lethal by %, we are becoming more efficient.

The mass shooting are just suicides that the media blows up into terrorism.  It is sad, but it is now seen as a good way to commit suicide, it's a way to send a message, they're telling us something is wrong, and not guns, something causing so many to commit suicide.  In the article it reads that now 6 out of 10 gun deaths are suicide.  On top of the hard circumstances some face, they are then given medications with ""suicidal thoughts"" side effects.  We need more safety nets, oh wait that's welfare...let them fall through the cracks in society AND give them access to guns, good job GOP.    And thank the democrats for pushing pills and vaccinations on the country.",-6,0,1444608311,1444727804
cvwd2u8,0,t1_cvw8f8p,FranticOne,"I'm not judging on enthusiasm.  If the media gives coverage to a Clinton-Biden dichotomy, they do not have to cover Bernie.  They can limit him in debates and show highlights of Zinger's against him.  I stand by my statement, because of the media, Biden entering will hurt Bernie.  They do not want Hillary to have to go up against Bernie, she can easily beat Biden.",-4,0,1444607214,1444727804
cvw7xrw,0,t1_cvw7srh,FranticOne,"Media says a lot with how they cover things.  It won't help Bernie at all.  The media will have free reign to completely ignore Bernie and set up a false dichotomy between Biden and Clinton, such that Bernie will become a spoiler candidate and get phased out.

That you are all so sure of what happens when Biden enters makes me laugh, you all agree on something you cannot know.  So sure of yourselves.",-3,0,1444598395,1444727804
cvw7u3t,0,t1_cvw7mq7,FranticOne,"Probably realistic that would be the poll, but I think a lot of the Biden supporters will really rethink their support, when they have to seriously consider Bernie or Clinton..  I think his problem with the elderly is killing him right now though, and not much way to fix that.  He will have to pull out better support from African Americans and get more youth vote.  I think he can still get there.",1,0,1444598229,1444727804

cvw7d80,1,t3_3od6sd,FranticOne,"This just in, Bernie Sanders has few rivals, since he entered he has surged in the polls, increasing by roughly 30 points since entering;  while, Hillary has only dropped in the polls month over month since Sanders entered the race.  Why is everyone begging Biden to enter the race, that makes me think they are scared of Bernie but can't admit it in the media.  Many voters will go Sanders for lack of an alternative to the Clinton Machine.  Biden will split that vote for Hillary to win.


In February Hillary was crushing her GOP rivals according to polls in article after article.  Young voters were going to turn out and they were Hillary supporters according to many articles.  That has changed to a 50/50 splite between her and Sanders.  Her largest base of support is the elderly and African Americans.  Hahaha, the elderly and the African American vote, great that's what its come to.",-4,0,1444597472,1444727804
