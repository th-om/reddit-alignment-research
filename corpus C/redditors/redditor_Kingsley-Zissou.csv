cvgtizm,0,t1_cvgm5gm,Kingsley-Zissou,"I worked with them in 2010, and almost deployed with them in 2011. There is a reserve company that operates out of Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in DC. From what I remember, there was no specific MOS for CA, rather the teams were made up of different MOS's (including corpsman tasked specifically to the unit) with 8 man teams lead by a captain or major.

And you're right on the hearts and minds stuff. The team we worked with in Afg carried a lot of cash and typically paid off locals for shit the grunts fucked up in a fire-fight or local construction projects. Cool people, but far from SF/SOF, at least on the MC side of the house. ",2,0,1443445228,1444721941
