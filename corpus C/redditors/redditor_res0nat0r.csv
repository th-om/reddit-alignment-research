cvxuwy2,0,t1_cvxqys5,res0nat0r,"But he's right. Sanders appeals to young people here without families to support, houses to pay off and jobs to keep. 
His black and white soundbites sound perfect to someone who doesn't have many assets and people to support, so they are totally fine with his ideas, because what have they got to lose?
The more, mostly older than the core audience here crowd, appreciates a pragmatist, someone not so extreme to make the other side want to cooperate even less than they already do, and that person right now is Clinton. ",1,1,1444713517,1444716791

> The majority of America is done with establishment bullshit centrist politics. Nothing gets done anymore. That's why Bernie and Trump are so popular.

Extreme candidates are always most popular this far out of the election, all you need to do is look at the last cycle to see this in action. Herman Cain was in the lead at one point.",1,0,1444532921,1444716791
cvv05st,0,t1_cvungzr,res0nat0r,"Obama was never an outsider. He was being groomed to be President years before ever since he made his very popular DNC speech, and had much insider backing including Ted Kennedy.

Good for the youngins, but they need to know that when you go all in on an outsider like Ron Paul, you are going to be sad. The youngins need to get out of the Reddit Echo Chamber a bit and realize there are a lot more people different than them out there in the USA, and that Sanders is too extreme to have broad enough appeal across the board to have a shot at getting elected.",-1,0,1444502676,1444716791

This is seen time and again on both the R and D side.",0,0,1444453558,1444716791
