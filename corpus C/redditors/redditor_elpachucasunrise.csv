Also, what accounting positions require ""shaking down"" people for money? Seriously what jobs are you applying to?",1,0,1444487465,1444731870

cvqn6qx,1,t3_3nr3m9,elpachucasunrise,"If this firm is GT or a similar firm, I would have to go national. The training will be so much better and the clients will be much better as experience then a local firm. 

The clients you are placed on is really important. If the local firm has you auditing doctors offices and benefit plans all year you'll regret turning down GT.",1,0,1444171404,1444731870
cvphxhl,1,t3_3nllmj,elpachucasunrise,It depends on firm policy. I would think this time should be booked to admin. Some firms have a policy where the in charge or manager must release you from the schedule a certain amount of time in advance of not needing you or you need to book the time to that client. ,2,0,1444088182,1444731870
