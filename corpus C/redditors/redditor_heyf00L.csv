cvpqf9j,1,t3_3nnuzg,heyf00L,"Forget batting for a sec, let's get rid of the endzone fumble = touch back rule. 

> A fumble that goes forward and out of bounds will return to the fumbling team at the spot of the fumble unless the ball goes out of bounds in the opponentâ€™s end zone. In this case, it is a touchback.

[from here](http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/fumble)

Just get rid of that last part. If it goes out of bounds, the ball comes back to where the fumble happened. If I remember right the touchback part was added first to avoid batting the ball forward for a touchdown. It's outdated now and makes the endzone an enemy of the offense in a sense. The defense should have to recover the ball to gain possession.",6,0,1444102628,1444730669
