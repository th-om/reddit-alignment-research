cvx1g8o,1,t3_3ogpgk,shadow776,"Any organ transplant is a very big deal, mostly because the immune system will reject any transplanted organ and thus the immune response must be suppressed/managed with powerful drugs. Which in turn leaves the patient at much greater risk of infection and other side-effects. In the media and conversation, organ transplants are treated as an ""end-solution"" - get a new heart and everything is great. This is not the reality and getting a transplant means a lifetime of constant medical attention. So transplants are only done when absolutely necessary, and alternative treatments are used when possible. 

To put it simply, you *could* transplant a stomach, but it wouldn't make the patient's life better.",2,0,1444666966,1444723748

cvvxjxi,0,t1_cvvhxfs,shadow776,"> EDIT: Had my SCOTUS rulings confused. It wasn't Citizen's United, it was a later decision, this one from 2014 that allowed unlimited campaign contributions. 

You're still misrepresenting the facts. The later decision you refer to removed the combined restriction on *individual* contributions, allowing people to contribute up to the $2700 limit to any number of different candidates. Previously the limit applied to total contributions. Most importantly, corporations still cannot donate *at all* to candidates, and individuals are still limited to $2700 per candidate. 

Corporations cannot donate. Unlimited campaign donations are not permitted. ",1,0,1444582306,1444723748
cvvkw2i,1,t3_3oaxff,shadow776,"Unlike any other streaming music service, Pandora has actual people listen to every song in their catalog, multiple times, to identify the attributes that allow the system to select music for the listener. Other streaming services use software to do this, or use algorithms that rely on similar artists or other listeners' song lists. 

The other big part of any business that lives on advertising revenue is the marketing department - which is not marketing to users, but rather to the advertisers that provide revenue (subscriptions are a very small part of their overall revenue). Pandora's customers are the advertisers, and they need salespeople and other staff to service those customers. ",20,0,1444542948,1444723748

Corporations *can not* donate directly to candidates. 

Citizens United did not change the rules about corporate donations.

If parents or teachers don't take action to correct a speech impediment in a child, that child will grow up not recognizing that they have a problem, or may not know it can be corrected, or may simply have grown accustomed to it and feel no pressure to change. Children also learn more easily than adults, so if it's not corrected in childhood it takes a lot of motivation to work on it as an adult. ",4,0,1444408117,1444723748
