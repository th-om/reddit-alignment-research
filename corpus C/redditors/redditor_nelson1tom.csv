cvwm5z6,1,t3_3ocm0j,nelson1tom,I guess my new goal is 160lbs. I'm curious to see how much my weightloss will slow. I havent weighed this little since middleschool. ,2,0,1444624173,1444723919
cvwly6p,0,t1_cvwieja,nelson1tom,"The hardest part was getting up early in the morning to go to the gym when the semester started. 

I stopped taking creatine and stopped drinking protein shakes because I couldn't seem to be able to drink enough water to keep things... regular. I've grown to hate anything that tastes like its saturated with whey after forcing myself on numerous occasions to eat that stuff when I felt nauseous.

Working out while nauseous/dizzy in general sucks. ",1,0,1444623685,1444723919

Start date: June 6, 2015; **231lbs**

Last weigh in: October 10, 2015; **169.8lbs**

**Diet:**


I started out with nutrisystem because I didn't want to put in the effort to do portion control by myself, and didn't know how else to start.  I did nutrisystem for 7 weeks averaging 1300 calories a day.  

Week 8 to 18 I ate regular food (mostly frozen food) and kept myself under 1600 calories (Average ~1500). I also ate a lot of protien bars (yum). All calories logged on myfitnesspal.

In all I had 2 or 3 cheat days total. One for my fiances birthday, another for a party, and Im pretty sure one for another celebration.

Unfortunately, I could never bring myself to eat a single salad. 

**Exercise:**

On week 3 of my diet I started going to the gym 1.5-2 hours a day 6 days a week. Saturday was my rest day. Sometimes I didnt take a rest day. For cardio I did the elliptical because I have knee and ankle issues. I try to do ""500-800"" calories, depending on how I feel.

cve9abv,0,t1_cvdspth,nelson1tom,"I don't mean this to offend, but people pick candidates based on a different set of criteria than you, and when assessing a candidate based on a common criteria may or may not rank as you do in your hierarchy of values. 

Think of how your *specific* goals in life differ from those around you. Doesn't it than make sense that people can come to a different conclusion to who would be the best candidate for them? And if yes, than Sanders is not *objectively* the best candidate. ",2,0,1443220446,1444723919
