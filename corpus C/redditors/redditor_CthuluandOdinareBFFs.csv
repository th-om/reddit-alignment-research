cvwbbsu,1,t3_3oczk7,CthuluandOdinareBFFs,I really enjoy philosophical discussions. I haven't read much by philosophers so it's often just bouncing ideas off of each other about how the world does and should work. Sometimes these talks can turn into debates though and that can be frustrating because my ideas are often idealistic and I might take it personally if someone attacks my logic without being constructive.,3,0,1444604060,1444725994
cvf044q,0,t1_cvew0zw,CthuluandOdinareBFFs,"On top of that, this $20/week will never get you out of poverty, just open up the possibility of retiring or moving to a nicer location in the long run. What would actually help is a descent job opportunity that a lot of people in this situation won't see.",9,0,1443291609,1444725994
cvezqhr,0,t1_cveywr3,CthuluandOdinareBFFs,"I'm not saying they are stupid, just repeating the social darwinism philosophy that supports the idea of poor people being poor because they are themselves, rather than environmental factors. Also, I don't think that our current welfare system is working. But we do have to recognize environmental factors in order to come up with a welfare system that does work. Just ignoring the issue will perpetuate the culture of an unproductive lower class that brings down everyone else.",6,0,1443290923,1444725994
cvezeoi,0,t1_cvevxvp,CthuluandOdinareBFFs,"That's a good question. There's definitely a factor of being able to find job opportunities. There are places populated by poor people that have no such opportunities. A person in this situation would have to think positively like you said, but also see past the only environment they know, and get themselves out of that situation. The solution that comes to mind is education, which happens to be worse in poor areas as well. So, do they manage it more often then not? If yes, we live in a meritocracy. But if there is any situation where they aren't more likely to succeed by trying, and they don't know how or don't have a way to move to a better situation, then that part of the system is broken.",4,0,1443290330,1444725994
cveyrgp,0,t1_cvewrry,CthuluandOdinareBFFs,"Your anecdote doesn't negate the effect of the environment. It sucks that welfare recipients are able to spend it frivolously but they do so, in some part, due to cultural factors that come from being poor. If we set up a system that shrunk the poor class, we as a society would have less stupid spending. It doesn't matter that poor people might be shitty people due to their genes.",5,0,1443289142,1444725994
cvev0dj,0,t1_cveticw,CthuluandOdinareBFFs,"Being poor puts you in a mindset of making the bad decisions you describe. Most poor people aren't thinking they are going to slowly work there way up into the upper middle class. When they end up with money at the end of the month, they spend it on things they want. Middle class people buy things they want more randomly because the decision likely won't prevent them from eating. They also make more informed decisions because they always have a little wiggle room in the budget and they can afford to make more long term purchases that require planning. You're absolutely spot on about these things but the point is that environmental factors have at least as much effect as personal dispositions.",14,0,1443282112,1444725994
cvcspo2,0,t1_cvcmzn2,CthuluandOdinareBFFs,"Well, companies only have a profit motive. The US government, even though they have a habit of ignoring their citizens, have other motives. You really can't get more corrupt than a corporation in a capitalist economy.",4,0,1443117067,1444725994
cvac34s,0,t1_cvabi54,CthuluandOdinareBFFs,"Right, they can abuse their power. Based on police violence recently, it seems like the law will always favor the police officer. I haven't heard of a situation where someone shot a police officer and got away with it because they were in the right. If you have, please share. I just don't see the point it you will end up in jail or dead if you defend yourself. Either way, you're screwed.",2,0,1442940272,1444725994
cvab64o,0,t1_cva256f,CthuluandOdinareBFFs,I can't say whether or not the TPP is good for our economy but the reason it's bad is how much leverage it gives international corporations over anyone else.,0,0,1442938888,1444725994
cva9x5x,0,t1_cv9zakx,CthuluandOdinareBFFs,"I don't really get this. No matter what you defend yourself with against the state, you will end up in prison or dead. The more firepower you use, the worse off you'd be. So, is the reasoning for having guns just for the off-chance that we have another civil war or descend into anarchy?",1,0,1442936960,1444725994
