cvab16i,0,t1_cva9ift,joelcm13,"I hear your argument that in the current system money rents power, but need a bit more clarification on what deregulation would to to improve the situation. It seems that a removal of regulations simply moves the power from the government to those with money, e.g. those being regulated. In a world void of regulations, would those with money only increase and consolidate the power they have?

While there is no doubt that the current regulatory system does a poor job in divvying up power as a result of the ability of money to ""rent"" power, it seems that instead of deregulation we should look for ways to account for the power of money in this situation. 

I don't know how realistic these ideas are, but I think it could be interesting to hear your thoughts on how we might go about reducing the influence money has over regulators. What would you think about making regulators elected officials? If money is the problem, maybe the problem could be addressed through the redistribution of wealth? ",2,0,1442938682,1444725530

cu6cly4,0,t1_cu5te2n,joelcm13,"Let me start off by saying thanks. Really interesting discussion here and it's helped me sight in my own thoughts about this. 

I think that Desegregation Busing is an extreme policy that is doomed to never be completely successful, but is the result of another extreme that marginalized a huge portion of the population. It seems to me that while these types of reactions are sometimes necessary to ""break"" society of the original extreme, they will ultimately be unnecessary and even detrimental in the future. 

The obvious argument for integration (I think both in your example of racial desegregation and socioeconomic desegregation within neighborhoods) is to avoid marginalizing groups of people to avoid the propagation of classism. This classism creates the most obvious barrier for individuals to improve their socioeconomic status, which is a prejudice for members of different classes (I.E. whether accurately or not - the rich blame the poor for the worlds problems and the poor blame the rich). What I think is more important, however, are the barriers this creates that are less obvious, such as the psychological and ideological impact of growing up rich vs growing up poor (I.E. how the setting in which we're raised impacts who we are, which is much less understood and much more nuanced than just working hard to achieve success).

I guess my view on that basic issue is that we should do as much as possible to understand and remove barriers. Unfortunately, that means a solution is likely nuanced and very unlikely to be found on the first go. More specifically, I think I fall on the side of supporting things like subsidized housing vs policies leading to total gentrification. I am typically for trying new policy initiatives with the understanding that they may not fix the problems completely, but help us learn more to create better solutions in the future. I also understand why people would oppose these types of things, especially those with libertarian leanings.

Regardless of what we find the best solution to be today, I do think we can all agree that the government does play a role in reducing barriers to improving one's socioeconomic status. I noticed in another comment on this thread that we still could provide some types of social safety nets. I am curious about what you think might be best? I tend to support greater access to education whether that be lower interest rates on federal student loans or even subsidizing the cost of higher education.

cs8cvzn,1,t3_3a18c3,joelcm13,"Not sure if this will come to fruition, but it seems that while his background and policy stances have an obvious draw to the liberal democratic base, the issues he's focusing on for the elections are directed specifically at low wage earners. These low wage earners are an enormous part of the population, don't necessarily represent one particular party, and love the idea of battling the ""political elites"". Whether or not this strategy works remains to be seen, but there's no denying he's got some early traction! 

Separately, I would say that a huge portion of Americans agree with his views on stimulating the economy through investments in infrastructure development and educating youth while paying for the excess spending by having the rich pay a bit more in taxes. In those terms, I don't think it's fair to say his views are extreme by any means. People just can't believe someone is willing to stand up to wealthy donors who don't share the views of the broader American public, which is understandable given the political climate over the past 10 years.

Edit: Would love to hear your thoughts on this!",5,0,1434464061,1444725530
