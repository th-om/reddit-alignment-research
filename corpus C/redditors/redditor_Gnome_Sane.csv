I agree. However it seems to be a steady 1/4 -1/3 of the party. These are the same people who repeat the ""Iraq Was A Failure"" meme that I am talking about. The same ones Jeb and Romney before him and McCain before him felt the need to pander to.

They were probably the first ones to start regurgitating the ""Quagmire"" memes, as Bush's support fell from 75-80% of the nation to 50%.

Now - maybe they could never articulate why they supported Bush originally. To be frank - My feeling is that these are the birthers and lowest-of-the-low low-information voters.

And the pollsters have the politicians bending over backwards to try to please this group that can't ever be pleased.

This is the problem. And Obama nailed that in his 60 minutes interview yesterday when asked about trump.

And until the GOP finds an actually leader who can explain what a responsible conservative position is... we will end up with pollsters telling the politicians that they need to make sure they don't lead - whatevertheydo.... Just try to please the pot and pan banging crowd....

I couldn't be more livid. Russia is creating a new alliance with Iran and Syria and Iraq that will be one of the biggest foreign policy blunders for the West in our lifetimes... and there is no leader who can explain what the alternative is to the Obama Doctrine failures.

cvxijxr,0,t1_cvxgng0,Gnome_Sane,"I think the interview on 60 minutes yesterday speaks to this a bit - and President Obama doesn't seem to be saying that relations with Russia are where he wants them... The reset was not brought up... but it is certainly a related exchange:

Steve Kroft: A year ago when we did this interview, there was some saber-rattling between the United States and Russia on the Ukrainian border. Now it's also going on in Syria. You said a year ago that the United States-- America leads. We're the indispensible nation. Mr. Putin seems to be challenging that leadership.

President Barack Obama: In what way? Let-- let's think about this-- let-- let--

Steve Kroft: Well, he's moved troops into Syria, for one. He's got people on the ground. Two, the Russians are conducting military operations in the Middle East for the first time since World War II--

President Barack Obama: So that's--

Steve Kroft: --bombing the people-- that we are supporting.

President Barack Obama: So that's leading, Steve? Let me ask you this question. When I came into office, Ukraine was governed by a corrupt ruler who was a stooge of Mr. Putin. Syria was Russia's only ally in the region. And today, rather than being able to count on their support and maintain the base they had in Syria, which they've had for a long time, Mr. Putin now is devoting his own troops, his own military, just to barely hold together by a thread his sole ally. And in Ukraine--

Steve Kroft: He's challenging your leadership, Mr. President. He's challenging your leadership--

President Barack Obama: Well Steve, I got to tell you, if you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in in order to prop up your only ally is leadership, then we've got a different definition of leadership. My definition of leadership would be leading on climate change, an international accord that potentially we'll get in Paris. My definition of leadership is mobilizing the entire world community to make sure that Iran doesn't get a nuclear weapon. And with respect to the Middle East, we've got a 60-country coalition that isn't suddenly lining up around Russia's strategy. To the contrary, they are arguing that, in fact, that strategy will not work.

Steve Kroft: My point is-- was not that he was leading, my point is that he was challenging your leadership. And he has very much involved himself in the situation. Can you imagine anything happening in Syria of any significance at all without the Russians now being involved in it and having a part of it?

President Barack Obama: But that was true before. Keep in mind that for the last five years, the Russians have provided arms, provided financing, as have the Iranians, as has Hezbollah.

Steve Kroft: But they haven't been bombing and they haven't had troops on the ground--

President Barack Obama: And the fact that they had to do this is not an indication of strength, it's an indication that their strategy did not work.

>**Jeb Bush Says He Misinterpreted Iraq Query**

>“I interpreted the question wrong, I guess,” Mr. Bush said. “I was talking about, given what people knew then.”

>The attempt at mopping-up was quick, but it did not bring the controversy to an immediate end: When Mr. Hannity asked about the 2003 Iraq invasion again, in yes-or-no fashion, Mr. Bush said he did not know what the answer would have been, saying, “That’s a hypothetical.” Then, he seemed to go out of his way to absolve his brother, former President George W. Bush, who ordered the invasion: “Mistakes were made, as they always are in life,” Mr. Bush said.

>**It was the third time in six weeks that Mr. Bush had to backpedal**, offering a stark reminder that despite his deep political ties and his family’s history in elected office, he remains a novice on the national campaign trail.

Now, regardless if that is a good representation of what happened or the version a more liberal NYT journalist would prefer their reader to see... the fact is that the single question that Jeb should have had locked down when he decided to run was The Iraq war.

Jeb did the exact same thing here that Romney did... he listened to his advisers and obey's the ""Iraq Was A FAILURE!!!"" meme and regurgitates what his pollsters say the american people want to hear...

And I couldn't have been more disappointed. I think if anyone could explain the outcome of the Bush Doctrine (A 13 year old democracy in Iraq and Afganistan) versus the outcome of the Obama Doctrine (Libya still run by militias, Syria still in Civil war with Russia coming to the rescue, Iraq being invaded by ""The JV Team"" in 2014...) it would have been Jeb.

But he didn't. 

And that is why the GOP is the party of TRUMP today...

I'm not wealthy, but I'll never give the GOP another penny after becoming the party of Trump. I'll possibly donate direct to a candidate... but so far I'm as unimpressed with everyone as I am with Jeb.",1,1,1444691402,1444717021

I don't have a source where I developed this opinion. It's my opinion, I didn't get it from someone else.

I did link to the ""Reset Button"" in the same paragraph, and that article explains the ""Reset"" policy and how the word was mis-translated and was actually presented as ""Overcharged"".
