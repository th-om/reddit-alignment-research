cvxowwh,0,t1_cvxo97z,StudentofDuckworth,my son was an economics major. I got him a job at a startup and within the couple of years learned enough front end stuff to move into the engineering group. He now works as a front end developer for another company and is studying C++ and his next job wants to move into backend work. He is making a good paycheck. ,2,0,1444702382,1444721218

cvxnktd,0,t1_cvxmzpn,StudentofDuckworth,"yep, I had run a version of it part time before I quit my job and launched full time. It generated a lot of money in a short time, basically $15k sponsorships. My overhead was a case of wine and a cheese tray. 

But eDataSource was a much bigger gamble. Fair amount of startup costs, no one had done it before, and while I had worked in the tech industry, I'd never launched one before. ",1,0,1444700281,1444721218
cvxngmh,0,t1_cvxmxwo,StudentofDuckworth,"Emerging Interest was a type of event business for the internet advertising business. Our launch party took place at TBWA/Chiat Day in Manhattan and John Scully, former CEO of Pepsi and Apple delivered the key note at the launch. It was a pretty big event covered by the advertising trade magazines. It was launched at the time when the internet bubble had burst, few people were going to trade shows, and vendors were having trouble getting into agencies to see decision makers. there were a lot of layoffs, and vendors would start to develop a relationship with someone only to find out they were layed off the next week. 

The model was simple: I took the trade show to the agency. Vendors paid me $15k for 5 meetings. I organized the shows with various themes, mobile, rich media, etc. Free to the agencies, 2 hour meetings, and we provided lunch. Decision makers had to be in the room, we kept each vendor to 20-25 minutes, and the agencies would get to see every company in a space. They then filled out a survey of who they liked, who they didn't, and why and who they wanted another meeting with. 

After a while agencies would hire us to put together shows on specific technologies they wanted. Then it was free to the vendors and the agencies paid. So by the end we had both going, agency sponsored shows and vendor sponsored shows. 

I self funded, I never looked for investors, we were profitable from the beginning and I had my line of credit to fall back on plus savings. 

then one day, one of my clients Ogilvy, asked me to find them a competitive email intelligence tool. I researched the market, there were none, so I shut down Emerging Interest and launched Email Data Source, the first email intelligence tool. It is now called eDataSource and has been in business for nearly 13 years. For that company I raised funds after the first 2 years, first with the New York Angels and later, one of our early investors became our lead investor for our B and C round.
