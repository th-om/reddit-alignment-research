That's false. After conception, unique DNA is created that describes a human being that has never existed before and has all the information necessary for a lifetime of human growth and development.

I, you, everyone, we began our journey at a fixed point in time - the moment of conception. Before that there was no individual. When a specific egg and a specific sperm join a specific unique individual is formed. Yes, many such individuals will be miscarried. There is, sadly, nothing that can be done to change that. We have no choice in the matter. When an individual is aborted - that is where choice enters in.",2,0,1444674714,1444720694

*One hundred percent* of all conceived embryos die at some point in the lives. Some die sooner rather than later, you and I have made it this far.

When we get old enough and frail enough it might be better to just put us out of our misery. It will certainly be cheaper than a long stay at an old folks home.

Funny, I don't really remember anything before the age of two. I guess I wasn't a human then either?

Yep and some people don't believe in evolution either. There is no such thing in biology as a ""potential"" human life. There either is one or there isn't. And if you've ever seen an aborted fetus, it is unmistakably a human being, just a little one.",1,0,1444665260,1444720694
