But seriously, his humor only appeases to certain types. He's the funniest person on TV, in my opinion. My father likes him at least. ",2,0,1444613271,1444718622

cvqcb4d,1,t3_3nq8yp,Dan-Morris,"I took a girl out to a local museum. We walked around, talked about a plethora of things we could relate to. She was cute, seemed to be into me, and everything was just going so smoothly. 

While walking around an exhibit, we ran into a group of students with a professor going over some of the works of art. We stood behind them whispering how we forgot to bring our notebooks and we're going to fail the test. A couple students gave us some mean looks, but we shrugged it off (probably they were more focused on me due to my tattoo and beard, which weren't allowed on the campus we are at). 

About an hour into the date, she mentioned she had a hookah in her room. I asked if she wanted to smoke it together, and she was down. We grabbed it from her dorm, drove my car the top of a nearby mountain, and just chilled, talking about everything under the sun. All in all, wasn't that bad. ",2,0,1444155042,1444718622
