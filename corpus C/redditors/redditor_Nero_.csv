cvtv2xj,0,t1_cvttdh0,Nero_,In this sub? This sub is probably more conservative leaning than anything else. I'd say it's moderately reflective of the US population (though we have a fair share of international English speakers as well). I think it's a backlash against /r/politics,4,0,1444409479,1444720686
cvrjr5i,0,t1_cvrfmbs,Nero_,"At least one gun in every classroom? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's way way more dangerous than the chance of a school shooting ever could be.

On top of that, students aren't prisoners, they aren't convicts or criminals, and they shouldn't be treated like them. Stuff like that is why people feel so isolated they do these school shootings in the first place.

People are so set on treating the symptoms that they forget about the root cause. It would be way safer and more effective to have a hands on faculty that made an effort to include every student and address issues before they escalate. But instead we'll get meaningless, ineffectual debate about adding more paperwork for guns.",0,0,1444242248,1444720686
cvmulcr,1,t3_3nae9e,Nero_,"It's barely news. Definitely local news, questionably national news.
5 minutes on the nightly news seems reasonable. 24 hour coverage for 2 weeks is boring and irrelevant to almost everyone. ",1,0,1443890081,1444720686
cvma7t3,0,t1_cvm9o6p,Nero_,"But it could just as likely be exceptionally strong. If you only get 3 attacks, and you hit all 3 (praise RNG) then you've done 100% more than the expected value. The chances of getting 16 hits out of 16 shots is a lot lower. You're much more likely to regress towards the mean by that point.",1,0,1443830460,1444720686
cvm8hxk,0,t1_cvm2cy8,Nero_,"It actually doesn't impact them *more* per se... There's just a higher variance with low attack speed units. They will be more likely to either overperform or underperform when attacking up. On average they are impacted equally compared to fast attack units, but they become more RNGy.",5,0,1443827120,1444720686
cvlwioe,0,t1_cvlvtdw,Nero_,"Yes, that's one right that's shared between children and adults. So is the right to free speech. But obviously free speech wouldn't mean much to a fetus that doesn't even have the ability to form thoughts, let alone express them to the world.

These different stages in life aren't the same and shouldn't be treated the same. Our laws should (and do) reflect this.",2,0,1443807696,1444720686
cvltj8z,0,t1_cvlspax,Nero_,"Right. I guess it's not really a major distinction, but I wanted to make the distinction between ""human"" which has a biological definition, and ""person"" which, among other things, has a legal and ethical definition.

As for the last part, we already have laws regarding fetuses and abortion. I don't know whether I'd ever want to go through them to reword them, seeing as they already work in their current state. In my opinion, this is really more of an ethical debate than a legal one at this point. ",0,0,1443803400,1444720686
cvlrjaw,0,t1_cvlq7nd,Nero_,"I mean, it's definitely human, it has human cells and human DNA. The debate is whether the fetus (which is human) is a person with legally respected rights. Also, if it does have rights, are they the same as a fully developed person?

In my opinion, we already have different rules regarding children, it's not that much different to have another class of laws around the unborn.",5,0,1443800441,1444720686

cvhuwzl,0,t1_cvhs87p,Nero_,"I think comparing them like that is moderately unfair. Would the centaur be improved if it had the exact same stats as an Ostwind? Probably. But the main issue is that German squads aren't big enough to retreat before they get shredded. OKW have the additional problem of very expensive armor, you are basically forced into relying on a Puma (which is a limiting opening, seeing as you've forgone healing and OP-SGs) or massing up racketens, which means sacrificing map presence because you can't focus your AT everywhere, and the slow centaur is still faster than a racketen.
