cvw5bb4,1,t3_3od7xc,frankeny,"Does anybody still play on the main Mindcrack server? Is it even still up? Some backstory, I used to watch a lot of Mindcrack and Minecraft videos. I kind of lost intrest roughly 2ish years ago and stopped watching. The only series I still watch on a regular basis is Etho plays Minecraft and the occasional snapshot video from Captainsparklez just to see what new stuff was added to vanilla. A few days ago I decided to browse through some of the channels I used to watch, and I noticed that I did not see a single actual Mindcrack server video. I saw some people playing modded series and such together, but I did not see a single vanilla server video. Is the Mindcrack server even up anymore?",3,0,1444594350,1444725058
