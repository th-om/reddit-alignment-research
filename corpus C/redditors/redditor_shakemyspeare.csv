cvpsnp1,1,t3_3nnyqz,shakemyspeare,"I started testing the cerave cream on the left half of my chin two weeks ago. I had a pimple or two in the first few days and have had nothing since. However, the OTHER half of my chin has been breaking out for the past week or so (including a deep pimple right in the middle around the line where I stop he cerave and use my normal moisturizer). I can't figure out if it's related or I just happen to have stuff going on on the other half of my face and should use the cerave on my whole face.

I've been nervous about starting cerave because it just seemed like something so thick and creamy would break me out so now I'm over-analyzing and not sure what to do.",1,0,1444107233,1444721739

It seems like the perfect argument to all those currently claiming they don't want their tax dollars going to abortion; is it?",7,0,1443624144,1444721739

cv1rz9q,0,t1_cv1quge,shakemyspeare,"Trailhead CU out in Portland, OR. It's one of those Kasasa checking and savings accounts. You still have to do the one direct deposit and 10 debit uses but I keep my emergency fund and my regular spending money in the same account and just know where the line is. I actually really love it, it's not huge amounts but it's still cool it be like oh hey I got 20 bucks this month for doing literally nothing ",1,0,1442276744,1444721739
