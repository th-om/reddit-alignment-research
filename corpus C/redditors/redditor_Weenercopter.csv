Op. 39. No. 4.  That quintessential ""Russian"" sound.  Love it. 

> Some of his stuff I could just listen to over and over again.

Absolutely.  I seriously listen to some of his stuff on repeat all day long.  I think I have a problem.  

Most people know about his [Op. 32. No. 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE6vin5GPWA), which, of course, is amazing. 

But it is a delight to listen to his unknown [No. 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKzUSSXdSsU) immediately after. 

No. 10 is tumultuous and dissonant and angry and sad, but then No. 11 is content, peaceful, sunny, childlike.  Almost like a resolution to whatever happened in No. 10.  B minor to B major.
