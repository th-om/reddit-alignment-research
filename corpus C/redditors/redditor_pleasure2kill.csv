With it easier to come out of stalls and having that hill assist, it eliminates two big things people worry about when learning to drive stick. Who knows, they may win over some people to driving manual this way!

cvuv3u8,0,t1_cvur8rx,pleasure2kill,Lol this is ridiculous. I gave you another chance and your only reasoning is that the fact the country goes to war at all proves your argument. You didn't even bother linking me to some dumb conspiracy blog! Low effort post. ,1,0,1444493393,1444721471

You have absolutely no proof of what you're saying, and you couldn't even provide it without seeking out ridiculous conspiracy blogs online. If you want to convince someone of your point of view in the future you have to learn how to do better than just reasserting the same sentence over and over again acting like it's ridiculous that I won't just blindly accept it as fact with nothing to back it up.",1,0,1444482718,1444721471

Haha well I guess I don't have much as far as suggestion - it would be interesting to see a Libertarian try to run as a Democrat though, seeing as how terrible of a time Rand Paul has been having even with moderate Libertarian views on the Republican side.
