Does that sound like a reason why any guy in your life would tell you that? ""I just wanted us to spend more time together. You've been spending all day with your girlfriend and I get lonely.""

Just from that, I think she's cheating on you. ",6,0,1444698951,1444729308

You jumped from saying that this algorithm helps the rich and powerful to ""haha, you proved my point because the government oversees fair distribution!""

You see, this is the part of the discussion where you're supposed to explain your side of things. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, which facilitates kidney exchanges through a match program, is set up by the US government and they oversee the distribution of kidney exchanges. 

But these exchanges have to be based on a match too. Not just any match either but a match that maximizes the total number of kidney transplants given a chain of trades as that's goal of the algorithm that runs this process. 

So, again, explain your position. ",3,0,1444667590,1444729308

cvwiihi,1,t3_3o1nza,jmo10,"Focus on goals if you have interesting goals. 

I guess there should be a few questions you should answer: are you applying to a pure math program?

If so, why pure math rather than applied math? Why math instead of operations research with a specialization in financial engineering? Why math instead of statistics with a focus in probability and financial econometrics?

You say you want to do research but research on what? Have you read any research in financial math? What about it interests you? Is there something that you think you could add to the literature? If so, what is it?

Have you thought about the overlap of financial math with other disciplines like economics? You can easily get a Masters in Economics along with the Math PhD.

Anyway, talk about research interests and only research interests if they're not dull as dirt. Let's say you're interested in monetary economics on top of your interest in financial math -- you want to better understand the process of monetary policy transmission, how the Fed's rate changes are influenced by the structure of financial products. So you look at the main source of debt for households: mortgages. 

Mortgages have different structures in different countries. In the US, mortgages have fixed interest rate loans so they don't change every time the Fed moves rates on reserves: borrowers have to refinance for their mortgage rates to change. In the UK, they have variable rate loans whose rates change with changes in monetary policy. 

Both countries have markets for securitized mortgages so how do quants get around that for UK mortgages as that affects cash flow estimations (you'd look this up before writing your SOP)? Would a change in mortgage loan structure necessarily increase the effectiveness of US monetary policy (this is your research question)? Let's say this switch nearly kills the securitized mortgage market in the US then banks can't easily move mortgages off their balance sheets and so are less able to lend. Can you make a counterfactual argument that would support this (again, look this up)?

Households with mortgage debt will then have a lower burden with an expansionary monetary policy and so they'll be better able to borrow. But banks might be in a worse position to lend overall as they can't easily move assets off their balance sheets. How would these opposing forces play out for the larger economy? Is there a way you can tell, looking at various histories of economies?

Be specific and detailed otherwise they might think you're not interested in research and only want to be a quant on wall street. 

Hope this helps. ",2,0,1444617168,1444729308
cvwhbih,1,t3_3oe9zh,jmo10,"Apply to NYU Stern. You actually have to apply to them through your NYU application. 

To be honest, I don't really know what to put in personal statements. Statements of purpose are different and are typically reserved for graduate school. Those are clear cut: why do you want to go to this program. And I'm much, much better at knowing what admissions committees want to see in SOPs.

Say if you're applying for a Business PhD at NYU with a concentration in Finance, which are just called Finance PhDs, then you might talk about NYU finance professor Rob Engle's work on volatility analysis and its application in risk management. Or you might talk about his work on measuring capital deficiencies and applications to the Fed's risk-weighted capital requirements. And how that inspired you to study financial econometrics hence your interest in NYU Stern's Finance PhD. 

Personal statements are harder to pin down because if they wanted you to write a statement of purpose then they'd call it a statement of purpose. 

Just don't be a box checker who tries to make his life more unique and interesting than it really is. There are plenty of applicants who are just as qualified as you and who have the same background. 

Maybe focus on your future goals/interests. I don't know. ",1,0,1444615053,1444729308
