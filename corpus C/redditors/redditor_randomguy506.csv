cvxqqjs,0,t1_cvxqfdg,randomguy506,yee but if you buy a weekly call on stock that is most likely to go up at the end of the week wouldn't that be already included in the prime you pay for the option? While if you buy monthly call that will not be the case since it is less certain that the price will stay at that price. Ex: if i think that $PLEB will be worth 5$ at the end of the week and will stay the same in a month should I buy the monthly call or the weekly call? ,1,0,1444705248,1444726314

But yes I do agree some point are stretching.  ",2,0,1444610029,1444726314
