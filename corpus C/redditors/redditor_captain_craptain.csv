cvu3eo6,0,t1_cvu2qsr,captain_craptain,"The only unions I have any respect for these days are the trades. There was some laziness and overstaffing on the construction sites but I will give it to you that by and large most were professional and efficient.  

There are just so many unions for everything these days where there should never have gotten into in the first place, mainly the government.  The government unions are the biggest cancer in our society by far, particularly teachers unions and bureaucrats at the state and federal level.  Service unions are a fucking joke like at big box stores and the like, Teamsters are a joke as a general rule, the SEIU should fall off of the face of the earth.  These are the bad unions.  

Steelworkers union? Fine.
IBEW? Fine.
Etc etc, the problem with unions elsewhere is that they are completely arbtrary at this point with min wage laws and OSHA.  They only serve one purpose at this point and that is being as loud as possible in the political arena.  There are way too many dues that go to political campaigns and way to many dues that go to make Union bosses rich, some of who make exorbitant amounts of money without doing any actual work like those they 'represent and fight for'.  

I've found that most union people have a hard time looking at what unions are objectively because they are invested in them. It helps their state of mind to think that they are actually good and serve them well.  I for one would be fucking ashamed if I ever again allowed my working terms, my benefits and my wages to be negotiated by a group like a union.  I'm worth more than the average employee, and I'm worth much much more than the worst employees who the unions protect from getting fired (to protect their income, the dues).  It would sap all of my pride and self respect to know that I let some stranger negotiate my income and benefits and everything else the exact same as everyone else.  Why should I settle for the same deal that the worst and the average employee gets?  

That is why every state should be a right to work state. If you can't negotiate, are too lazy to negotiate or are too stupid to realize that you can negotiate, then by all means join a union.  If you are a hard worker who can think and speak for themselves then you deserve the right to advocate on your own behalf and not be forced to leave it up to some asshole who doesn't know you, doesn't care about you and will never even meet you.  That shit is just pathetic right there.  

Unions are like zero tolerance policies. There are lazy and worthless and simply an excuse not to have to think and take action for your own benefit.",-1,0,1444421913,1444717368

Yes, it pretty much guarantees that fact.  I've been a teamster for UPS, I've been on construction job sites with union carpenters, electricians and plumbers.  I have a lot of family members in unions.  I know exactly what it means when you refer to a union workforce and it is exactly that; overstaffed, overpaid and generally lazy as shit.",0,0,1444420304,1444717368
