cvx8pop,1,t3_3oeppi,brucejoel99,"John Boehner can simply pick the Acting Speaker on his way out the door.

[The Rules of the House](http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/house-rules.pdf) state...

> (A) In the case of a vacancy in the Office of Speaker, the next Member on the list described in subdivision (B) shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore. Pending such election the Member acting as Speaker pro tempore may exercise such authorities of the Office of Speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to that end.

> (B) As soon as practicable after the election of the Speaker and whenever appropriate thereafter, the Speaker shall deliver to the Clerk a list of Members in the order in which each shall act as Speaker pro tempore under subdivision (A).""

Thus, it's possible for the House to simply have an Acting Speaker (or Speaker Pro Tempore) for the remainder of this Congress if the House can't muster a majority for any candidate. 

The Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who's dropped out of the Speakership race, is most likely #1 on said list.

What happens if Boehner fails to give the Clerk a list is unclear.",2,0,1444677632,1444723382

cvwjkjx,1,t3_3oe367,brucejoel99,"The question is hard to answer.

He’s about as popular right now as he was at this stage in 2011; his approval rating is 47 percent in the latest poll. The economy is stronger in key ways. And the Democratic base is more passionate about him than Hillary Clinton. But Obama—who won in 2008 as an outsider—is now seen as an insider, at a time when Americans want a change agent. See the summer success of Bernie Sanders and 
Donald Trump. Becoming a lame duck has liberated the president to take action on issues like immigration, Iran and climate change. These positions could backfire with independents in a general election, but they could also galvanize record turnout among Hispanics, African-Americans and young people. 

The debate over Obama’s electability is moot, but it dovetails with a broader, ongoing conversation within the Clinton campaign about the extent to which she should tie her fortunes to the president’s. She knows that she needs the so-called Obama coalition to turn out in force next November, which is one reason she’s tacked to the left in recent months. Many of these voters, registered by the Obama campaign in 2008 or 2012, will only turn out for Hillary if they see a vote for her as a vote for a third Obama term.",13,0,1444619071,1444723382
