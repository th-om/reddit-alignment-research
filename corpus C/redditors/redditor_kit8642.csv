They pushed it off and it jumped back on. So they pushed it off again and a shark ate it.... The poor guys was just trying to get away.,5,0,1444619753,1444725731

Just look at Cheney's 1994 interview prediction of what would happen if they took out Saddam during Dessert Storm.

Their plant was taken out and knew they had a big enough inventory for their returning customers, they dropped all advertising with in 3 days of the disaster.  This essentially dropping my wife's deal like a bad habit.  Always thought it was cool a company knew they had such loyal customer base, they could drop advertising revenue and maintain because of their reputation.  ",7,0,1444534745,1444725731

>[Questions about the ISIS use of Toyota vehicles have circulated for years. In 2014, a report by the radio broadcaster **Public Radio International noted that the U.S. State Department delivered 43 Toyota trucks to Syrian rebels**. A more recent report in an Australian newspaper said that more than 800 of the trucks had been reported missing in Sydney between 2014 and 2015, and quoted terror experts speculating that they may have been exported to ISIS territory.](http://abcnews.go.com/International/us-officials-isis-toyota-trucks/story?id=34266539) ",1,0,1444430982,1444725731

The sandwich technique works best when pointing out an issue, specifically if it's a criticism.  You basically sandwich the criticism between two positives, for example, ""Hey Joe, good job the other day on such & such, I need you to tighten up on such & such, by the way everything else looks good on such & such.""  Try it out.",17,0,1444320907,1444725731
