If humans could live forever, would it be unethical to kill myself at age 200? At 150? At 99? At 25? 

Are people supposed to live infinitely no matter the means, at all costs, because ""life is precious?""",3,0,1444528600,1444722933
cvudbpm,0,t1_cvtydpt,Madeforuou,"Honestly, I read this thread expecting something different but I shouldn't have bothered. It's the same damn defensiveness again and again, as if being called racist is the worst thing in the world comparatively to incarceration rates or the crap minorities sludge through daily. 

I feel like every time racism comes up people are bizzarely supposed to tiptoe around white people as to not offend them! It's crazy. Saying that preferences have been culturally shaped and maybe people should reconsider them--actually put action and effort, lest you be a passive enabler--is not attacking.",12,0,1444439506,1444722933
cvucv5g,0,t1_cvub26w,Madeforuou,"Eh? Hispanics probably do not encounter the same kind of discrimination because many of them are or can pass for white thanks to the conquistadors. 

Notice how you singled out black and Asian people--we are the ones who typically deviate from European features. When you get over to the  Med/Iberian peninsula then you start entering the territory of ""white looking people with tans.""",11,0,1444438587,1444722933

That's not to say white peoples are bad, but it is to raise awareness of ""Yes, we live in a very white world and we have to surrender to these standards because we're the ones without choice.""",18,0,1444438170,1444722933
cvqzdkc,0,t1_cvqjt04,Madeforuou,I feel like people focus on the 5 morons who spend improperly when there are 500 who know what's up. Spiting the rest because a few do poorly doesn't make sense to me.,3,0,1444194054,1444722933

We are people who have evolved to have sex and relationships.

We are not robots.

Many people would like to have relationships because it makes them feel meaningful the same way an artist likes to paint or an author writes (me). 

It is not needy to want another human connection that is deep and... Meaningful.",4,0,1443797634,1444722933
