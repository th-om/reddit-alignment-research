EDIT: After a quick search, I wouldn't say this is authoritative, but it certainly looks like they're not in Russia's [list of terrorist organizations.](http://nac.gov.ru/page/4570.html)",1,1,1444720991,1444728058
cvuiay9,1,t3_3o40sj,Lorpius_Prime,"The patent section actually wasn't as bad as I feared, but the copyright section was worse.  Locking in life+70 years of copyright is just absurd, and it's especially shameful to know that USTR was lobbying for that just as we're finally starting to get more public attention and pressure for reform in the US.  But what really mortifies me are actually the anti-DRM-circumvention measures.  Given how awful and even dangerous DRM measures have been, and the way they've been abused to prevent end-user modifications of their property, it's outrageous to put DRM protections into an international treaty.",6,0,1444450496,1444728058
cvsf8sq,0,t1_cvscbl0,Lorpius_Prime,"Glass-Steagall *might* have made the response to the financial crisis a little bit easier, both technically and politically.  But it's simply not plausible to blame its absence for the crash in the first place, which was caused by a classic investment bubble.  Even if conventional banks had had less direct exposure to highly speculative investments, all of the same amount of money would still have been out there chasing those investments, it just would have flowed through different channels.  So when the market collapsed, it would have been with exactly the same destructive force.

The fundamental problem was that people didn't know how to correctly value certain financial instruments based on subprime mortgages.  The reason they didn't know is because those instruments were newly invented, so all the valuation methods were theoretical rather than based on actual experience.  That isn't a problem you can fix with regulation: there *will* be exciting new classes of investment in the future, and they *will* lead to speculative bubbles some of which will burst, but it's impossible to know which investments are good and which are bad in advance.  Blaming government policy for what is, essentially, a naturally-emergent phenomenon of human behavior is at best misguided, and at worst dangerous because it distracts from more practical approaches.",-3,0,1444309810,1444728058
cvses8s,0,t1_cvscaxw,Lorpius_Prime,"The US government spent about  $1 trillion on the Iraq war from 2003 to 2010. While that does sound like a large amount, remember that the US government spends about 3 or 4 times that *every year.*  For perspective, I like to point out that during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Congress passed an $800 billion spending bill to staunch the bleeding... and then a *second* $800 billion just 4 months later (Oct '08-Feb '09) because they wanted more stimulus.

Bottom line: the Iraq War was expensive, but still paled in comparison to the economic forces behind the recession and the resources employed to combat it.",8,0,1444308814,1444728058
cvsavxj,0,t1_cvs7w3w,Lorpius_Prime,">The big difference is Bush took a well functioning country-- surplus, booming economy, no wars--and systematically destroyed it, ruining the economy to benefit the rich, spending the surplus on tax cuts and getting into two wars.

Yeah, see, claims like ""the Bush administration ruined the economy to benefit the rich"" are just as nutty as more recent claims that President Obama's health care reforms will or have caused public disasters.

Neither the economy nor any element of US society suffered anything that could reasonably be called ""ruin"".  And even the most serious economic crisis, the 2008 recession, had basically no cause in Bush administration policies and very little in government policies in general.

One can find plenty of sound reasons to dislike President Bush or any other Republican without needing to reach into the absurd, but it's rarely done.",30,0,1444295280,1444728058
