cvvact7,1,t3_3o7mfj,ElLibroGrande,"So this happened to a friend of mine in high school. We were horse playing and broke a piece of his dad's statue. We got the superglue to fix it but the end was dried out and wouldn't flow. So my friend, being briliant, points it toward him and squeezes. Ends up with superglue in his eye. Like this lady, he shuts his eye and puts his hand over it refusing to open it despite our cries to do so. After running his eye under the sink he discovers he can't open it. He's freaking the fuck out now. We try cutting off his eyelashes but it doesn't work. Finally we go to his mom's bathroom, pour some nail polish remover on his eye and rub it in. Bam! Eye opens and gets flushed with acetone. Ouch! But more water and he was okay, eye in tact.",9,0,1444521600,1444722390
