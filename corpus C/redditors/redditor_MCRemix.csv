cvxvs66,0,t1_cvx9wou,MCRemix,"> Isn't that exactly what the Democrats were doing?

Yes, but the blame goes to the Republicans for two reasons:

(1) The Republicans are responsible for drafting legislation that can pass.  If the Dems controlled congress, it would be their job.

(2) The Republicans are trying to make the change.  The Dems are trying to keep the status quo.  Blame goes to the one seeking change.

The blame goes to the one who is responsible for crafting the legislation and who is seeking the change and holding the government hostage to do so.

> If there had been any significant compromise there would have been at least a few Republicans voting for it and a few Democrats voting against it.

I dont believe this.  The Republicans and the Democrats each held the party line because of the increasing partisanship, including the Republican commitment to try and make Obama a one term president.  

That said, the ENTIRE legislation is built on a conservative idea.  If liberals had their way, it would have been a single-payer solution, not a market based solution.  You cant say it isnt an attempt at bi-partisanship.

> Whether you believe that is true or not, it is a valid justification.

This would only be a valid justification if it could be shown to be true.  Not only do the videos show that it isnt true, but none of the elected representatives are even trying to claim that it is.  If you listen to their words, they simply assert that PP is ""bad"" and ""doing wrong"", not that there is anything illegal about their activities.

So NO, it is not a valid justification to ""believe"" that they are acting illegally without proof.

> But the contention is that they are conducting illegal activities. If that is the case, then defunding is a perfectly legitimate avenue.

If it was the case, sure.  BUT IT ISNT!!!  Numerous investigations have occurred and cleared PP of any allegations.  The videos themselves (the long versions) make clear that there is no profit occurring, but perfectly legitimate reimbursement.

Here's the rub...you want to defund PP because they provide abortions.  You dont really care that they are involved in fetal tissue procurement (which incidentally has MASSIVE benefits for medical research and treatment), you care that they are the leading provider of abortions.  You dont care that they havent acted illegally, nothing they could do would make you happy, except if they stopped providing abortions entirely.

And I respect those opinions, I do.  I understand how deeply those beliefs are held.  But I believe the government (a conservative government) should be based on law and facts.  

The fact that people dont like PP is not enough to form the basis of singling out PP for prejudicial treatment in the distribution of payments for medicare/medicaid services.  Neither are the lies that the videos show illegal behavior, when they clearly show legal activities.  

I believe in respect for facts, law and integrity, and the GOP is showing none of those right now on this issue.",1,1,1444715979,1444724207

cvwdmmz,0,t1_cvwb06b,MCRemix,"> Yet * not a single Republican * voted in favor of the ACA, doesn't sound like the Democrats made any meaningful compromises in order to gain Republican support.

You didnt read my cited language very well... The ACA is built on a six-person bi-partisan effort.  Only after the individual mandate was added (originally a conservative idea), did the GOP decide that no one would support it and they held the party line.  The fact that the GOP held the party line doesnt mean it wasnt originally a compromise and a bi-partisan effort.

> It is not ""hyper-partisan"" to attempt to follow through on what you were elected to do. Every time there is a dispute in Congress, the talking points are ""the Republicans need to compromise"", ""the Republicans need to give ground"", ""the Republicans are threatening to shut down""; there is never any mention that, maybe, the Democrats should compromise or that the Democrats are threatening to ""shut down"" if they don't get their way.
> In almost all of the legislation introduced since the last election, the call has been for Republican compromise while the Democrats have been praised for standing firm to their principles.

It is hyper-partisan to try to hold the government hostage to win on a very partisan issue.  I would say the same thing if the Democrats were holding a budget hostage in order to enact gun control measures.

Maybe the blame on the GOP is because the GOP has moved further right than ever before?  Either way...the GOP controls both houses and is the one that crafts the laws and they are responsible for creating laws that can pass.  Otherwise they're just wasting their time and failing to govern.  

If Democrats controlled Congress and kept trying to pursue scorched earth strategies, I'd say the same thing.

> First, there is plenty of wrong doing, whether it was legal or not is another matter.

Only if you are calling the abortions wrong doing.  If you are, I understand, but that isnt relevant in a discussion about whether they committed wrong doing such that they should be singled out for negative treatment by the government.

> Making a profit off of fetal tissue recovery and transfer is illegal, as well as altering the procedure for non-medical reasons.

There is zero evidence that they profited off of the recovery.  The ""funding"" they receive is to cover costs, not to create profit. The more organs there are in a given transfer, the greater percentage of   costs they must cover of the ""parting out"".  It also makes sense for parting out to cost more, because there are greater costs in dividing and transferring organs separately, rather than together.  None of this discussion creates illegality.

I get why people would not like to hear this discussion, but all of this is perfectly legal.  How is that hard to understand?

(I've heard the argument about ""altering the procedure"" and this appears to be more about ensuring that doctors focus first on patient health.  So long as it does not alter any medical treatment, particularly the type of abortion or the timing of abortion, minor changes in approach to removing any fetal tissue does not appear to be illegal.)

> Yes you are. I can pull up websites that claim otherwise, even The Hill, which generally opposes the cuts, admits that local centers would be able to absorb the increase in patients after a few months. Most of the sites claiming that local centers could not absorb the additional increase in clients either ignore that they will receive increased funding to cover new staff and facilities or take the approach that, in areas where PP is the primary source, no one else will step in to take up the slack.

I could not find any real evidence on this issue, so just say this, it appears that neither party really knows know whether this would work.  I'd suggest then that the government should have proof that there is capacity before they take the step of defunding a primary provider of care.

> Which is fine by me, at least it means that there won't be any increased spending. 

Right, although I'd prefer them doing a real budgeting exercise, the government must keep moving, so I'm okay with that.  I also like the fact that they are keeping spending level, would prefer a budget cut, but it's better than nothing.

> But you said they shouldn't pass legislation that won't be signed. Which is it?

Your question implies you believe they cannot draft a budget that the president will sign.  This is only true if (a) they are incompetent or (b) they are so hyper-partisan that they refuse to govern in a reasonable way and draft a budget that could pass.  Frankly, they dont want to do their jobs because they would have to actually make decisions on priorities and it's far easier to just pass a continuance and then go home and tell their constituents that they ""held the line on spending."" 

> Not true at all. Whether you think the Republicans are right or wrong, you have to admit that they have plenty of ""justification"".

No.  The only justification they have is that PP conducts abortions, which is legal.  That isnt justification.

> Almost all of the Republicans I know would have supported continued funding of PP in order to continue their ""women's health"" services had the organization agreed to spin the abortion providing services into a separate entity. Planned Parenthood would continue receiving full funding to provide STD screenings, birth control, etc. While the new organization ""Unplanned Parenthood"" would compete for financial support on their own merits. What would have been the problem with that?

Because we arent talking about a line item directing funds towards PP, we are talking about funding that goes to Medicaid/Medicare and happens to be used at PP because they provide services to low income women and men.  It is inappropriate to single a one organization to not be an eligible recipient of federal funds for conducting legal activities.  

Your suggestion that they should have to split their services is also unreasonable because the government shouldnt be getting involved in the business structure of medicaid/care service providers.  It's a simple question, did they provide the service to a qualified person, if yes, reimburse them unless you can show that the organization is engaged in illegal activity.",1,0,1444608276,1444724207

You cannot FAVOR the majority without oppressing the minority.  By creating a favored status, you've established a religion, even if it is never the ""state religion"".  An unofficial state religion can be just as harmful as an official state religion.

> Legally speaking, the express support for a particular religion, although not officially creating a ""state religion""...would have the same effect. You simply cannot favor one religion above others without establishing a favored religion.

This remains true...you cannot favor a religion above others without creating an informal establishment of religion.

>Could you please explain to me where in the Constitution is the right to not be offended? I seem to have missed that one.

I never claimed a right not to be offended, though I will clarify my statement.  It isnt about offense or feelings.  It is about not having what appears to be a formal establishment of the Christian religion amongst the military.

Commanders all over allow blatantly Christian prayers as if that is the norm or the official religion of the military, which would be against the Constitution if true.  My point is that it's common place, although IMO not appropriate.

> As to your ""keen awareness"", it must have not been so keen, given that up until very recently Muslims made up a tiny percentage of the population and at two tenths of one percent, they are still vastly underrepresented in the military.

Your argument is that because muslims are a low percentage, i could not have seen them around me or known they were around me?  I KNEW athiests, I KNEW jews and I KNEW muslims in my units.  Dont cite statistics to me to try to refute my own personal experiences.

And is their minority status somehow important?  It's okay to have a state sponsored religion only if those of other faiths are few in number?

> The effect the legislature intended was to coerce the states into particular behavior. That it didn't work is what would have gutted the law. 

The EFFECT the legislature intended was to expand access to healthcare.  You present one opinion that it was intentional (supposedly backed by the drafter) to write it that way, others have said that it was an error in drafting.  The evidence is inconclusive (unless you buy into the biased crap talk radio is selling).

I havent researched it (because frankly I dont think anyone has been bold enough to try), but I'm fairly certain if you start eliminating appeals for people convicted and sentenced to die, it violates due process because they have no opportunity for legal address of grievances.

> It does not. The specific phrase ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"" meant and was understood to mean that Congress is prohibited from creating a state religion - no more, no less.

Since we all love Thomas Jefferson, I'll refer you to his letter that created the phrase ""separation of church and state"" in 1802, where he rejected the idea that the establishment clause allowed the government to support one religion over another.

Legally speaking, the express support for a particular religion, although not officially creating a ""state religion""...would have the same effect.  You simply cannot favor one religion above others without establishing a favored religion.

> The Supreme Court was never asked to weigh in, because everyone knew it was legal and the idea that it wasn't would have been shocking.

This is so wrong it's laughable.  The Supreme Court was not asked to weigh in on lots of issues for years.  That does not mean they were automatically ok under the constitution, just that it hadnt ruled. 

That said, did our national culture accept Christianity as being part of government?  Oftentimes, yes.  Government support for Christianity was commonplace for a longtime. 

Does that make it okay?  No.  We've matured as a country and no establishment of religion also means not playing favorites.

> As a former military member, I can tell you that even when I served many decades ago, there was very little religion in the military unless you went looking for it - which some people do, so that they can be offended and sue.

Every major function I attended began and ended with prayer.  Usually, these were blatantly Christian prayers.  As a Christian, they never offended me.  But I was acutely aware that there were atheists, jews and muslims around me that might have been.  Just because no one objects, doesnt make it okay.

Canon #1 of judicial interpretation is to attempt to give effect to the law that the legislature intended.  The interpretation posed by the conservatives would have gutted the law.

> It is hard to promote abstinence before marriage, when the socially liberal culture (and government that makes contraceptives and abortions available to minors without the parents' knowledge or consent) that they are bombarded with from every conceivable outlet (including the schools) is sending the opposite message.

Your approach is contrary to the evidence and studies on this issue.  I am pro-abstinence for my kids and think it's the best way, but it is naive to propose policies at odds with reality.  Reality is that we need real sex education and promotion of contraceptive use, because they work.

> The death penalty is far less expensive than locking them up for life.

Killing is cheap, but Due Process is expensive.  The only way to change that is to change the constitution, so your point is not really relevant.  Unless you want to eliminate Due Process, the death penalty is more expensive.

> One man's politically motivated investigation is another man's crusade for justice.

I'm not sure anything I say to you would change your mind on this, based on the examples you cited.  Benghazi has not revealed what you claim it has unless you buy into the rhetoric of talk radio (which I cant listen to anymore).  (If you can cite even one neutral source for your point about finding multiple felonies, I'll retract my statement.)  In fact, Kevin McCarthy admitted that it was politically motivated on national television recently, so I'm not sure why you'd cite that example.

I'm going to guess you're not a lawyer.  (I am and I'm also not young...see my previous statement about my kids.)

The Consitution DOES say that.  In fact, until Bradford v Roberts in 1899, it was assumed that the government could not come even close to religion at all.  That case opened up the doors slightly, allowing payments to go to secular purposes managed by religious organizations (a hospital in that case).  But until then, no commingling at all was believed to be allowed.

You are correct that the government did things that promoted religion in the 1900s, but this doesnt mean it was legal.  It simply means the Supreme Court was never asked to weigh in on the propriety of the issue.  As a former military member, I can tell you the amount of religion that continues in the military is astounding.  But frankly, it isnt really legal IMO (I'd be curious to see what SCOTUS says).

This is your opinion.  I'm guessing you have no formal legal training or you'd understand King v Burwell.  It's complicated unless you understand the canons by which judges interpret laws.  But I'm going to assume you dont care how they reached the result, only one result would have been acceptable to you.
