The world makes decisions with both the gut and the brain, not with a fucking flow chart and the behaviour of a middle school classic debate team.",0,0,1444599861,1444719359
cvw7x3g,0,t1_cvw7aun,RamblingWrecker,"Him being a socialist is something that is absolutely relevant, and the American people have the right to know. We have a right to know how a political candidate defines their political alignment. Maybe he actually defines himself as a communist, or a socialist. 

Labels are incredibly important. We spent mountains of blood and treasure to contain USSR and Red China. Their regimes killed millions, and sought to have government control over the economic futures of all mankind. If Sanders truly espouses greater government control in our economic and political day to day lives, then the American people have a right to know, and decide if they want some socialist from Vermont running their lives when we fought so hard to prevent that. I guess the Soviets may have actually won.

And stop treating online debate like some sort of fucking card game, where suddenly the presence of a fallacy overrides every single thing that has been said, and draws the entirety of your attention. It's like watching a dog that is only able to hump things, devoid of any reason of unique thought, just grotesquely humping away.

So, you're concerned with pedantic issues and self aggrandizing. I'm actually talking about the issues.",0,0,1444598365,1444719359

Lit highways are the exception rather than the rule.
