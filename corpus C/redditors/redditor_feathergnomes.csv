cvwfxuf,0,t1_cvvw5sr,feathergnomes,"I'm sure everyone and their dog has a suggestion for you, but I also had a similar life. It only went on for about 4 years, but those were the worst 4 years of my life: the fear of being caught out without a toilet destroyed my social life.   
Anyways, I went through a whole slew of tests. I finally had some allergy tests, and I was allergic to, like, *everything*. Anyways, an elimination diet and avoiding my worst triggers, and I'm mostly better.   
There are a lot of tests the doc can do, and in my experience, they lump cases they don't understand into IBS. If it's feasible, just keep getting tests.   
I never expected to be allergic to garlic and yeast :-/",3,0,1444612631,1444724344

cvuku88,0,t1_cvug3fx,feathergnomes,"Even if you're not sure you can buy a house, pick a realtor you dig, and sit with them they'll walk you through everything, even if it turns out you can't afford a house.    
I'm not saying waste their time. Every, but they'll invest some time in you in the hopes that you'll pick them to help you find a place.    
I had *no* fucking clue what anything was, and my realtor walked me through every step.    
If you find one that won't, find another. Truth is, it's a little complex, and that's why there's a while set of professions built on navigating it. ",1,0,1444457814,1444724344
cvuklf1,1,t3_3o6hq4,feathergnomes,"Most of your thinning will be genetic. Scritching a lot to make sure the sebum isn't blocking your hair follicles will help anything that might be caused by NoPoo.    

I've just run my fingers through my hair three times, each one coming up with a hair. We lose hair all day long; it's totally normal. Follow a girl around one day, you'll see the hair piles that get left behind :)   
I didn't notice my hairs that fell out when they were super short, because they were super short. You'll see way more the linger your hair gets, because they're easier to see :) 

Mostly this is just to say don't stress :) ",4,0,1444456957,1444724344
