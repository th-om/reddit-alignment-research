cvxet9t,1,t3_3oi3h7,tyzad,"""Strong"" or ""tough"" on an issue generally means that a politician favors more government action on an issue. For example, a politician who is strong on crime will favor things like mandatory minimum sentences, capital punishment and overall more policies that punish crime.  The same generalization can be applied to issues like climate change, guns, abortion, foreign policy, immigration, etc. Politicians use this type of language because it's politically palatable and appeals to human emotions to paint oneself as tough and one's opponents as weak. The reality is that most situations aren't black and white, and require a degree of nuance in policymaking that might not make for a good political bumper sticker, but pragmatically fit the complexity of the real world.

cvx1ljo,0,t1_cvx1dia,tyzad,"I think it's reasonable to assume that he'll get at least a slight boost in the polls. He has a very strong progressive record in Maryland that practically nobody knows about, he's articulate, and he has some decent proposals. If for nothing else, I'll think he'll benefit just from increased visibility and name recognition. ",3,0,1444667191,1444716799
