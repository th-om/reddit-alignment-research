Okay, let's trust you as the authority here and denigrate everyone else because they disagree. 

First of all, there's a reasonable argument to be made that FDR's policies prolonged the Great Depression. Second of all, the O HOLY GRAIL Scandinavian countries may have free higher education, but what about their quality? Why do you think international students all want to go to universities like Princeton or Stanford? Because they're the best in the world, not the ones in Helsinki or Oslo.

cvxgcyj,0,t1_cvxfnoc,Atheia,">but it seems that you're just basing your position on your own preconceptions?

My preconceptions, eh. If you actually went outside and saw what the average American voter is like, you'd find that it's a whole lot more than just *my* preconceptions. A whole lot more. 

>No, he isn't: he's a self-described democratic socialist, which is a very important distinction.

Not an important distinction to the average American voter. The word socialist has such negative connotations, and for good reason. All this blabbering about ""democratic socialist"" and ""socialist"" is just petty semantics to most. And you're not even right. He has described himself as a ""socialist."" And as much as you want this distinction to be made, socialism will always be associated with the policies that crippled Venezuela and the Eastern Bloc. 

>You mean the part where he doesn't want to lose even more American jobs to competitors overseas?

More like the failure to understand the near-universal consensus among economists that free trade benefits both parties involved, or the failure to see the long-term slow-but-steady gains vs. the short-term sharp but short lasting losses that come with it. But you're welcome to disagree with this consensus, which is as broad as the consensus on how supply and demand works. 

>Would you care to elaborate? As far as I can tell he's veeeeery moderate on gun control. Which specific calls do you take issue with?

First of all, he's just called for a ban on assault weapons. That would do jaaaack shit on gun violence in the country. Second of all, by being so liberal on gun control, he flip flopped on his previous more moderate stance, undoubtedly influenced by his home state (New England as a whole is known for being more liberty-oriented than the rest of the US). 

>I disagree completely. So do plenty of other people. And the electorate at large can see that the Republicans' economics have failed, and failed, and failed.

""My policies may be jack, but theirs are too!!""

Yeah, you're not going to get very far like that. You're also not going to get very far with the notion that government is the solution to every problem in existence. 

>So?

You honestly don't see what's the matter with this? Seriously? How delusional do you have to be? How cooked up in that fetal position are you to not realize that being so far left isn't going to get you very far in the nomination process? It's like he's asking for moderates and independents to vote for the republican nominee, assuming he does get the nomination. Heh, Hillary's not going anywhere, barring criminal charges, which for her won't happen.

>This isn't really an effective argument - it seems pretty circular (or at best hand-wavey). And it's worth noting that his ideas are to the direct detriment of career politicians broadly. I think we both know that there are people on both sides of the aisle benefiting from the huge influx of corporate money into politics.

I'd like to see why this is circular in any way. All I'm saying here is that Democrats are more centrist than him, and because of that, they're less inclined to support him than Hillary. I think it's a pretty simple argument, so I'd like to see your side of the story.

>I mean, you're welcome to believe what you like.

So are you. But when he drops, I'm going to enjoy the drama unfold as reddit collapses into its own mucky dimension. The widespread support he is getting on this site, even from non-political subs like this one, is literally the calmest weather before the wildest storm. 

The mere fact that people are willing to bet hundreds of dollars on this is so laughable, so sophomoric, that they should do it by all means. Perhaps they'll be more reasonable later on in life, when they cringe at their naive past. Or maybe not. After all, adults are just kids in grown-up clothes.

I love the downvotes too. I really hope they made you feel better about your own position, and that the point values of the comments in the discussion don't reflect on how accurate/insightful they were, but instead based off of if you disagreed or not. Keep it up, because you are a shining example of what redditors ought to be.

And you're not sure why I'm saying he isn't electable? Why don't you go outside and look at the demographics of the average American voter. This guy is a self-declared socialist. His trade policies are wack. His gun control calls are knee-jerk, reactionary, and won't do jack shit. His economics as a whole are a disaster for the economy. He's more left than every democrat in Congress. Even they admit he wouldn't win a general election.
