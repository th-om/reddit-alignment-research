Then you are absolutely pro-choice, as all child birth has a risk of death to the mother.

Good, that works right along with my overall point that Carson is full of shit on a grand scale.",1,0,1444624306,1444717034

I mean, don't forget, there's the Popey's Chicken story, that Carson has said happened.

""I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeyes organization. Guy comes in, put the gun in my ribs. And I just said, â€˜I believe that you want the guy behind the counter.""

Yeah... way to rush him Carson!

cvu4cap,0,t1_cvtutwa,jadwy916,"I disagree. I feel that Obama (or, rather the Justice Department) investigating the Ferguson police department isn't what deteriorated race relations there. It's what pointed it out.

And also I disagree with you in thinking he ""stoked the flames"" of local controversies. He may have made statements about them, but it was us (the internet and social media) that continued the conversations constantly that fanned the those flames.

And I agree that those flames may not have needed ""stoking"", but ignoring a smoldering flame will not prevent a forest fire. Pointing out that race relations in this country are still for shit after all these years is not a bad thing, it's just uncomfortable. It will never go away, but we should be able to point out a racist with full confidence that we'll live to tell about it, don't you think?",1,0,1444423400,1444717034

cvu3v65,0,t1_cvtwri6,jadwy916,"Like /u/TitoTheMidget said, ""The Justice Department found rampant police racism"", this is the government (AKA Obama) inserting itself into a situation and finding that race relations were already a mess. Pointing something out does not put one at fault, like the world is a giant game of ""He who smelt it, dealt it"". 

My opinion on Obama and race relations differs greatly from yours. The race relations you say he harmed, is the race relation that was already there... long before Obama. Him getting involved just made the media point a camera at what the rest of the country could conveniently avoid. Him getting the cameras pointed on it, forced the Department of Justice to investigate. This makes people uncomfortable, but the truth is like that sometimes, and it's the truth that shall set us free.",1,0,1444422590,1444717034
