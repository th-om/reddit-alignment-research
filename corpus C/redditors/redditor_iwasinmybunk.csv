cvwbdx0,1,t3_3o6wix,iwasinmybunk,"can you cite any statistics or any studies which might lend support to your proposal?

what do you say about this study which looked at CT suicide and homicide rates before and after they tightened their laws in 1995? a sharp drop in homcide rates and a modest drop in suicides occurred. compare that to state of similar demographics which loosened laws and saw the rates of suicide and homicide increase. some significantly. To look at one of the stats, there are roughly 40K suicides a year and the one repealed law saw an increase of 8% (which would have meant an additional 2800 suicides if that were to have been adopted nationally. instead CT saw a 3% decrease in suicides and other states saw between 2-4% drops, which is around 1,000 lives saved. as percentages go that might not be huge, but with so many suicides, that small shift adds up to a big number. 1,000 people if their changes were adopted nationwide.

i asked why you keep referring to deaths. don't blame responding to someone else your first post said suicides and homicides and made no mention of non fatal shootings. My question to you remains unanswered by you.",1,0,1444603770,1444725615

Ill support that. owning a gun? uhhh... no. if its a violent crime I mean. if you cheated on your taxes thats different. but if you're a violent offender I don't want you having access to a gun, thats just stupid. your mention that they make easy targets because theyre unarmed i find myself saying meh to that. theres a price to pay for your crime and this is part of it. criminals certainly have the right to defend themselves, just not with a gun. learn karate or something.",1,0,1444603432,1444725615

I started the fight because I hit you. I can walk away, I can call your mom a whore. I can offer to buy you a drink and de-escalate things. i can turn my back.

cvunlul,0,t1_cvul5fq,iwasinmybunk,"why do you keep saying gun DEATHS? the average number of gun shooting victims is 200,000. yes only 600 accidental gun deaths occurred but the number of accidental gun victims is wayyyyy higher. so for you to say that his argument isn't going to make much of a change because were only talking about 100 or 600 victims is completely false. you said you wanted to talk about ways to reduce gun violence. gun violence is gun violence, no matter whether the victim lives or dies. whether it was intentional or accidentally, its still gun violence.

cvungih,1,t3_3o6wix,iwasinmybunk,"please cite any studies which back up your assertions, especially your 1-3 points. You say ""gunman shootings"" and say they are rare. that statements makes no sense. all shooting involve a gunman by definition. also your title is about gun violence. your first point says that stricter background checks wont reduce gun violence then you talk at length about crimes committed by people with mental health issues. 

http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/14/justice/guns-background-check/

over 1M background checks were rejected for having a criminal background. this smash the republican talking point that ""criminals don't go to legal sources to buy guns"". they mot certainly do, and are stopped by it. closing the gun show loophole and requiring checks there would (based on the above) logically catch more people who shouldn't be buying guns. this flies in the face of your very first assertion that stricter background checks wont reduce gun violence.

although i like your proposals i find your assertions confusing and flawed.

I want to think the answer is yes. I hope it is.",3,0,1444442720,1444725615
