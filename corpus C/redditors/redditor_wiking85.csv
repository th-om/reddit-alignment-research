cvx97y7,1,t3_3og86p,wiking85,"I cannot offer any evidence other than my opinion: the best lie is the one you tell yourself, so I think cult leaders are more often than not true believers, but are also very charismatic individuals that draw people to them through personality, people that are receptive to their message.  I'd say take Hitler as the most famous of all cult leaders, he really did believe in his crap, but he also surrounded himself with yes-men, purging all the people that didn't buy into his cult of personality from power.  Guderian talks about this in his memoir ""Panzer Leader"" though some caution should be exercised due to his self-serving narrative.  However that part has been echoed and backed up by other historians, like Ian Kershaw that did the definitive bio on Hitler.  

In many ways I think both the leader and the followers self select for cults; most people don't go for it, but some are open to particular messages and are easily caught up in crowds, so end up going along; like hypnotism you have to want to be manipulated to be vulnerable to it.  Of course the larger the group is and the more sophisticated the methods are to play to human instincts (again going back to the Nazis look at the rallies they organized and how they effectively turned the entire nation into a cult organization with punishments for speaking out and refusing to participate); for people born into the system their personalities and awareness of the world are shaped around their faiths, so they are even more suseptible to that manipulation; at their heart all religions start as cults and as more people are brought into the system, mainly through social pressure/coercion, then it becomes self reinforcing; many people are aware that the religion/cult is not real, but social pressure keeps them invested (Jehovah's Witnesses) or leading the system, while many others really do believe, even within the leadership.",1,0,1444678360,1444721765

cvwzsw8,0,t1_cvwyzwf,wiking85,"Watching the video it already is trying to play statistical games by dismissing that the share of national income is being held increasingly by a smaller number of people.  And when this guy mentions real income he neglects to take into account that that doesn't factor in healthcare costs, the price of oil, housing, or education.  Certain consumer goods may cost less, but the big staples cost more.  Real income as metric only accounts for inflation, not PPP:

Also I'm not seeing any sources, just vague mentions of studies, not where to find said studies for analysis of them.  There is a link too of a study, but that was conducted in 2007 of the period from 1996-2005, a very cherry-picked stat of less than 10 years, before the 2008 crash and the subsequent economic losses that we still haven't recovered from.  His claims of gains by the poor are not reflected in the linked study.  Also I think when he talks about income mobility he's only referring to those that move up in their economic bracket, not down, which heavily skews the information.  Plus the income mobility segment starts before the bubble burstings of the late 1990s and late 2000s, which would upset everything he's saying.  Its all just lie, damn lies, and statistics.",13,0,1444664313,1444721765

cvw7j2e,0,t1_cvw71ax,wiking85,"That's arguable given the Korolev was initially basing his research on the groundwork von Braun did:

>Along with other experts, he flew to Germany to recover the technology of the German V-2 rocket. The Soviets placed a priority on reproducing lost documentation on the V-2, and studying the various parts and captured manufacturing facilities. That work continued in East Germany until late 1946, when the Soviet experts and some 150[18] German scientists and engineers were sent to Russia. Most of the German experts, with the exception of Helmut Gröttrup, were those involved in wartime mass-production of V-2, and they had never worked directly with Wernher von Braun. The leading German rocket scientists, including Dr. von Braun himself, surrendered to Americans and were transported to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip.

>Stalin had decided to make rocket & missile development a national priority, and a new institute was created for the purpose, the NII-88 in the suburbs of Moscow. For the German engineers, Branch 1 of NII-88 was set up on Gorodomlya Island in the Lake Seliger some 200 kilometres (120 mi) from Moscow. 

>With the blueprints reproduced, thanks in part to disassembled V-2 rockets, the team now began producing a working replica of the rocket. This was designated the R-1, and was first tested in October 1947. A total of eleven were launched, five hitting the target. This was comparable to the German hit ratio, and demonstrated the unreliability of the rocket. The Soviets continued to utilize the expertise of the Germans on V-2 technology for some time; in the regime of secrecy surrounding the ballistic missile program, Gröttrup and his team had no access to classified work of their Russian colleagues on new rocket technology as well as adequate production and testing facilities. This made any meaningful development impossible and negatively affected the morale of the German team. In 1950, the Ministry of Defence made an official decision to dissolve the German team and repatriate the German engineers and their families. The first group was sent to Germany in December 1951, and the last in November 1953.[18]

>In 1947, Korolev's group began working on more advanced designs, with improvements in range and throw weight. The R-2 doubled the range of the V-2, and was the first design to utilize a separate warhead. This was followed by the R-3, which had a range of 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi), and thus could target England. Glushko couldn't get the engines to develop the required thrust, and the project was canceled in 1952.",3,0,1444597739,1444721765
