cvuyr1k,0,t1_cvrqxc1,CG121,"Pro v1x spins less than prov1 with driver and long irons. Spins more around greens than prov1. 

High spin rates could be a matter of shaft flex too, not always the balls fault. ",1,0,1444500073,1444725193

cvn8lme,0,t1_cvn8awg,CG121,"Good point. I think its still uneven at impact though. So much so sometimes that i'll dig the heel of the club into the ground before the ball. This problem alleviates itself when i choke down, as that flattens the lie angle, but i lose distance by doing so. 
What does it cost typically to have ur lie angle adjusted? Im definitely in no market for new clubs + fitting. ",1,0,1443914968,1444725193

cvmted9,1,t3_3navkk,CG121,"I have a little more bend at the waist than most at address. Consequently, the toe of the club is slightly off the ground. Would you reccommend a lie angle adjustment, or a clublength shortening for me, to flatten the club at address?",2,0,1443887986,1444725193

I warmed up the putter on an aerated practice green and proceeded to hit 3 consecutive putts about 10-20 feet past once i got to the first real green lol.
