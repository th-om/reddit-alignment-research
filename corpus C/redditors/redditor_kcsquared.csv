cvf73sc,0,t1_cvf6sq5,kcsquared,"Yeah, but where in Raleigh? 

The reservation system is for league play, I think. You don't need a reservation. They are public. First come, first serve. I've never been booted off a public tennis court.

And welcome to Raleigh! They really have an amazing parks system. Take advantage of it while you have it! 

Also look into the the [public pool system](https://www.raleighnc.gov/home/content/PRecRecreation/Articles/AquaticsHoursOfOperation.html). As someone who now lives in a city with a shitty public pool system, I miss Raleigh's pools sooo much.
