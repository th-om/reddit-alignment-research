The point is, we have had an 11% conviction rate of innocent people. We still were willing to pull the trigger and kill them. We can't just lower the standards for convictions with the thought of, ""Oh, well we aren't completely sure, but they can just sort it out on an appeal."" 

As far as I'm concerned, a wrongful conviction is equivalent to a wrongful execution. We judged them worthy to die. We cannot use the appeals process as a justification or mitigation of that. 

Also, the numbers for innocently executed individuals is less available/reliable because the point is moot once the deed is done, so why waste resources on the continued investigations? Rates of exoneration are the closest actual statistic we have to go on. ",1,0,1443621661,1444725569
