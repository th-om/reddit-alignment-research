Someone privy to a real estate transaction interfered in the middle and redirected the funds elsewhere by impersonating the sellers, or something like that.  It was a fraud, had to be an inside job.

You will need to make a lot of calls tomorrow, to everyone involved in the transaction.  Was a lawyer involved?  First call.  Otherwise, some hard questions of the people who gave you a bad check.  If it isn't straightened out instantly (like, a good check Fedexed to your grandparents' home, overnight, or the money wired to their account, same day), then make a police report and contact a real estate lawyer.

So when you start causing trouble, of course their first call is to your boss, to get said boss to stop you from causing trouble.

Now you know.

There's nothing illegal about being a shitty boss.
