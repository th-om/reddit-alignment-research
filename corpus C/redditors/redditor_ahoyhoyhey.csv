I'm not sure what other comment you're referring to.  And I certainly wouldn't have said that ""it would help everyone"". ",1,0,1444707595,1444717712
cvxs1vu,0,t1_cvxrv0r,ahoyhoyhey,"You have to understand that there are different types of pain.

In terms of broken bones, surgeries, basically anything that severely disrupts the structure of the body, as far as my view goes opiates are far and away the better choice.  Marijuana is not really for that type of pain.

But in terms of chronic diffuse pain, or neuropathic pain of various types, or GI pain of various types, opiates often don't work very well, and marijuana can really shine.

As to the opiate withdrawals, I do not personally know how it might work, though it appears it can for some people.",1,0,1444707465,1444717712

cvxrx7n,0,t1_cvxp55i,ahoyhoyhey,"I think in this case, the truth is on the side of those that think that marijuana has a place in medicine.  That is the most simple, basic point that I'm trying to make.

Secondarily, I am stating that as an example, on this very thread there are perhaps... I don't know, 25 people who say that they personally have used marijuana to help them overcome their opiate and/or benzodiazepine habit, and that doesn't include any PMs that I may have gotten.  There are perhaps... I don't know, 8-10 or so people who say that it didn't help them.

That's in addition to the content of the article.

The truth is, there are no highly statistically powerful trials on this, largely because there was no legal way of doing so until a couple of months ago.  In the meantime, we use what evidence we have, which largely seems to point towards marijuana at the *very least* being worth looking into as an adjunctive form of treatment for addiction and many other things.

I am not saying ""the anecdotes a few people have given you outweigh everyone else's experience"", I'm saying that the general weight of the evidence that I have seen, which is I think probably more than most, is in favor of further research and energy going into medical marijuana.

I never once said that it would help everyone, nor do I think I would ever say that.  That would be quite ignorant.",1,0,1444707249,1444717712
cvxrsn1,0,t1_cvxphhz,ahoyhoyhey,"No worries at all about the long-winded response!  In all honesty, I can't remember every comment exactly on this thread, but there was one other who mentioned ankylosing spondylitis specifically.  I can't recall if this person said that it helped, or whether they used marijuana, but it may be worth a look.  Of course, that's just one person, but still...

Good luck, regardless.",1,0,1444707031,1444717712
cvxrpyw,0,t1_cvxptr8,ahoyhoyhey,"What about using suboxone or methadone?

As we've seen in quite a few cases, ""abstinence only"" type of approaches work for some, but not for many.

In my opinion, if marijuana helps people get off of their opiate habit, then I'm all for it.  And unless you're an addiction specialist, I doubt you see it more regularly than I do, as it's something I deal with at the very least weekly, if not most days in my job.",0,0,1444706904,1444717712

I've found after having a number of highly upvoted posts with this general type of content that after a certain amount of time, the crazies come out, and that seems to be about now.  Thanks for increasing my faith in humanity just a touch.
