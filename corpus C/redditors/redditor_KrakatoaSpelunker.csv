Quite the opposite. The US benefits greatly from money that essentially flows from outside the country *in*. This could be money earned outside the country by US nationals (living either in the US or elsewhere), or foreign money that is invested in the US. It also includes the money that the US is only able to print due to the standing power of the dollar as the *de facto* international currency.

If all that cashflow slows down, even a little, the effect it would have on the US economy would make 2008 look like a tiny hiccup.",6,0,1442848579,1444728444
