cvx8ymk,0,t1_cvx7wvl,C_L_I_C_K,"A crazy K/D like this proves that Imperial side is broken. All you need is good aim, some skills, and camp the vehicle spawns, particularly the AT-ATs. The spawns for Rebel side is a joke, especially during the last phase. It's like a shooting gallery when you're in the left walker (on the Imperial side).

Of course a good Rebel team can easily win. All you need is a few orbital strikes on the AT-ATs and/or total air control. ",7,0,1444677994,1444726956

Most games I'm in now, people camp the AT-AT and AT-ST spawns. This game was one of the few games where I had them to myself for the most part. :p",6,0,1444673323,1444726956

cvsayjm,0,t1_cvs8hfm,C_L_I_C_K,"That link proves that you're a hypocrite. See, unlike you, I back up my comments with proof. You talk shit about those who criticize this game, but then go and do it yourself... constantly. Hilarious how you claim you don't post under alts or that you speak your mind on the forums. Yeah, that's why you posted your little rant here and not on the forums (under your in-game name), am I right? Lie some more, bro.

All you do is talk shit, start shit, be a hypocrite, and act like an annoying little twerp. You were and probably still are terribad at this game, always dying and screwing up in raids. Like I said 2 months ago, nobody liked you in the SG and everyone was ecstatic that you ragequit on your own like an angry, spoiled nerd. I'm just sad I wasn't online when you nerdraged and ragequit. It was hilarious how everyone except Gronk was like ""glad he finally left."" Gronk said and I quote ""didn't know everyone hated him so much."" Nobody could stand you and your ego. Wonder if you still brag about banging so many chicks to your new SG (if you even have one) lol.

Oh, and don't flatter yourself. I have a good memory and thought it was hilarious how hypocritical you are, acting like a two-faced whiteknight whenever you can. I'm sure you never gave me any thought. That's why you made that post about me, when I nor anyone else ever mentioned you in that thread. You're such a horrible bullshitter.

cvs7hqa,0,t1_cvs1qu7,C_L_I_C_K,"I actually think they did a great job with the team they have... or had. This game was complete trash the first year of launch. Then it was resurrected when Brevik, Doomsaw, and the rest finally decided to listen to the players and implemented what the PLAYERS WANTED. It became one of the most miraculous transformations in online gaming history IMO. 2014 was a great year for the game...

Then it all went downhill again. They stopped listening to the players and just did whatever the hell they wanted. Success got to their heads. They went with a cash grab model again, releasing as many heroes and costumes out as they can, while ignoring new content, hero balance, and quality patches without bugs that keep breaking the game. More and more veterans kept quitting MH but they didn't care. They just kept pushing out patch after broken patch, hoping to cash in on their 2014 success. MH suffered and became an imbalanced mess, which eventually forced Gaz to rethink their strategy around April / May of this year. 

It seemed like [things were starting to get back on track](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelheroes/comments/3hggih/marvel_heroes_2016_a_new_dawn_for_gazillions/cu7hgeq) a couple of months ago, but then the layoffs / restructuring started to happen. It's tough to maintain and improve a game when your team leader (Doomsaw), lead content designer (Heretic), and jack of all trades workhorse (amthua) all leave at the same time... not to mention the other less visible members of the team. It's hard to be optimistic for this game when the team leader who was trying to get this game back on track is replaced with an incompetent individual who doesn't even deserve to be a manager at McDonald's. It's tough to keep playing this game when promises keep getting broken, delayed for months, and/or quietly forgotten about time and time again. It's impossible to believe Gaz anymore when we've been lied to far too many times before.

Has this game improved? Yup, [it sure has.](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelheroes/comments/3dyekp/top_5_changes_for_a_returning_player_in_the_last/ct9z3hl) Are new players still enjoying the game? I believe they are. However, a large portion of veteran / hardcore players are jaded, bored, and/or gave up on MH and Gaz long ago. ",4,0,1444282655,1444726956
