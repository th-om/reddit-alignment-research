cvphdcw,0,t1_cvpclhu,bfhurricane,The entirety of /r/guns would be in a database. And how would you recommend we check on their mental health? I'd much prefer we didn't turn into a police state where folks purchasing multiple firearms are on some sort of watch list (me included).,3,0,1444087183,1444717464
cvp7kz3,0,t1_cvox3ez,bfhurricane,"I get groceries for two weeks at about $80-$100. Good food is very affordable to the general public. Most people have no idea how much money they're wasting by eating out all the time. I'm just a mid twenties guy making a median income - can't afford a family yet, then again, that's why I'm not having kids.

May I ask what experiences you've had in this country that's made life an unaffordable hell hole?",0,0,1444071846,1444717464
cvn1enw,0,t1_cvmzv9r,bfhurricane,"There's a few:

- Strong economy. We have well paying jobs in just about *any field,* and it's not artificially inflated with multiple sector bubbles, such as China. We can expect a heathy, growing economy for a while now.

- America has an absurdly large proportion of the best universities in the world.

- American aerospace, biomedical, heavy industry, defense, and information technologies industries are miles ahead of our competitors. We continue to innovate and thrive.

- We have enough natural gas and petroleum to become the world's leading exporter. On the other hand, we lead the world in nuclear technology.

- We lead the world in charitable giving, topping out at just over $30 billion annually. Next is the UK and Germany, at about $13 billion each.

- Our immigration problems are overstated. We have more immigrants than anywhere on the planet. Racism exists - though not nearly as bad as most places in the world. America is a largely successful integration of all the world's races.

- The variety of culture and geography is amazing. We have New England, the Atlantic Coast, the South, mountains, and the Pacific, each with their own unique quirks, habits, and allegiances. Making one's way through our states is simple and rewarding.

- The food, music, movies, and language of the US had dominated the globe. There is no shortage of means for recreation.

There's a lot or country does wrong, you can simply look on the front page for that list, so the good doesn't come without the bad.",16,0,1443901696,1444717464

I don't believe, however, it's hypocritical to declare a state of emergency for what has been standard weather in recent history. Unless, however, someone can point me towards data showing our storms are worse due to the increased global temperatures.",12,0,1443731198,1444717464

cvind1d,1,t3_3mw1i8,bfhurricane,"Plebe boxing ultimately isn't about fighting - it's about building character. After getting leveled onto the mat with a bloody nose you learn to get up, sack up, and return the favor. You learn how to take a slice of humble pie and start building mutual respect among your peers, whom you'll spend the next four years with.

On the outside, these bouts are rather unglamorous - they last a few minutes a piece and both cadets are usually spent to nothing by the half. As a participant, however, your sole goal is pummeling your adversary to victory, and these small bouts are a good way to learn how to channel your strength and mettle to win. A meager concussion rate isn't worth scrutinizing these practices.",10,0,1443566574,1444717464
cvhgrn6,0,t1_cvgtf6h,bfhurricane,"US Army here, innovation within the military is abysmal. High risk aversion + politics results in poor doctrine and very slow change to strategy (see: War on Terror). Weapons innovation is largely due to earmarked payouts to private corporations where our tax money is held above the heads of private citizens grappling to outcompete the next. I wouldn't compare the military to the government whole, unless it's to describe the similarities between poor oversight on entitlements.",4,0,1443482382,1444717464
cvech8a,0,t1_cve6zrz,bfhurricane,"I agree with you on the steps removed, but at the end of the day it's Congress that has the power of the purse and votes on all matters related to the military. We don't live in a military dictatorship and our military leaders aren't elected representatives, that's the cost of a democracy. It's perfectly normal and appropriate for our representatives to check and approve of all military matters. Likewise, it's very prudent that the military is open and honest with Congress in all matters relating to national security. At the end of the day, nothing abnormal here to double check that the Ranger standard is being upheld. I hope any investigations come back with a positive light on the integration, as transparency is a foundation of the republic.",1,0,1443226668,1444717464

Like hell. We're 3 months away from a deadline for a plan to integrate women into combat arms (a decision coming from politicians, not the military), and you want to keep our elected representatives, especially this veteran, with no oversight on the matter? I'm going to err on the side of incredulity and allow ample investigation into all matters related to women in combat arms.",3,0,1443161214,1444717464
