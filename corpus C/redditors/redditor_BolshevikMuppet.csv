cvuvz7c,0,t1_cvut29o,BolshevikMuppet,"> headlines like these reinforce the meme that people have little enthusiasm in supporting Clinton, and that's going to hurt her on the ground.

Really? Because over the last month, according to this article, Clinton gained 12 points and lost ten (net gain of 2%) while Bernie lost 7 and picked up 4 (net loss of 3%).

The entire logic of your argument only works if we ignore fluctuations in Bernie's support, and focus exclusively on fluctuations in Clinton's.

The same polls cited here say that Sanders' support is lower than it was a month ago and Clinton's is higher. Why is that not the main story?

Because BI has a narrative it likes (Bernie good, Clinton bad) which it is trying to prop up and hopes that people like you (its target audience) won't spend too much time thinking about the numbers, and just accept it as ""see! People don't like the candidate I don't like.""

And judging by this post, their target audience meets their expectations of not looking beyond ""see, she's bad.""",11,0,1444495027,1444729200

By that godawful analysis method, over the last month Clinton gained 12 points and lost 10 (net gain of two) while Sanders actually *lost* 7 and gained 4 (net loss of three).",21,0,1444494625,1444729200
cvub7bh,0,t1_cvu0vui,BolshevikMuppet,"Well, yes. Most states (I want to say all but I'm hedging like Aegon Targyerian) distinguish non-consensual penetrative sex (what I'm going to call rape) from non-penetrative contact with the sexual parts of someone else (what I'm going to call groping).

This gets confusing because some states call groping ""sexual assault"" and rape ""rape"", while others call groping ""unlawful sexual contact"" and rape ""sexual assault.""

cvu5jcd,1,t3_3o3tst,BolshevikMuppet,"Oh my god. I'm having something like a PTSD flashback to my first year of law school.

If I remember the godawful blue book correctly, the period after an ""Id."" *is* capitalized, but the comma after a case name is *not*. And then I remember that I want to go back and yell at my legal writing professor because of all of the goddamned things to focus on, that is among the least important things in the actual world of legal practice.

No one checks, no one cares.

And for the person saying it's something about how diligent and attentive someone would be in practice? No, it's not. It's a measurement (at best) of how much mental energy someone is willing to put into irrelevant minutiae rather than the actual practice of law. I've been an attorney for a while now and have found absolutely no correlation between blue book usage and quality of legal analysis.

cvtx8ma,0,t1_cvtorfo,BolshevikMuppet,"> You omitted the first part of the element of the crime, which requires declaring allegiance to a wartime enemy of the United States. He didn't do that

Except that's not actually an element of treason under U.S. law. Here's how it's defined in the constitution:

""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.""

Notice how ""declaring allegiance"" isn't actually there? You're creating a new element based on what I can only imagine is either an incomplete recollection of the constitution or a third-hand account with no attempt to verify it yourself.

And since it can easily be read as ""adhering to, [which consists of] giving aid and comfort"", Snowden could fall under the definition of treason.

>For treason, you have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he intended to provide aid and comfort to the enemy.

I can find no reliable source indicating that treason requires specific intent to provide aid, rather than the general intent that applies in the vast majority of criminal cases. Maybe you have a source?",2,0,1444412662,1444729200
