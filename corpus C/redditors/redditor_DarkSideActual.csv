cvtet1k,0,t1_cvtem7u,DarkSideActual,"Yeah, since we're apart of a state law enforcement agency we get to use their comms and their reject vehicles. It's not so bad because we have a pretty slick vehicle maintenance agreement with the city cop garage that operates 24/7 so any problems are fixed straight away. The biggest downside is that they took off the siren and we only have amber colored light bars. ",1,0,1444367784,1444717444

cvpem7g,0,t1_cvpehn3,DarkSideActual,"My app didn't have any options other than ""connect"" and it would fail to connect every time. It appears you can't edit the network setting unless you are connected. I was wondering if I was missing something (other than reset). In this case it looks like reset is the only option.

cvpdjgd,0,t1_cvpd3a1,DarkSideActual,"I was initially thinking that there would be an easier or more efficient way than just resting the thing. You know, something along the lines of an ""edit network settings"" menu.
