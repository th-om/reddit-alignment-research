cvtdopl,0,t1_cvt83h2,st0nedeye,"Good question.

A pro tempore Speaker of the House is automatically appointed by house rules.

Now get this..... 

Basically the Speaker gives a list of House members to  the House Clerk.  It's basically a role call list.  Whomever HAPPENS to be first on the list...becomes the pro tempore Speaker.

Boener has confirmed he submitted the list, and the general speculation is the first person on it is....wait for it.

hahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhahaahahahahahahahahahahahhaaha.

Edit Source:

"" “As soon as practicable after the election of the Speaker and whenever appropriate thereafter, the Speaker shall deliver to the Clerk a list of Members,” this provision provides. The rules add that “in the case of a vacancy in the Office of the Speaker,” the first name on this list becomes Speaker pro tempore and “may exercise such authorities of the Office of Speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to that end.”""

cvreryk,1,t3_3nura3,st0nedeye,"The type of voter fraud the GOP is ostensibly trying to stop is practically non-existent.

Their goal is disenfranchising voters, plain and simple.

Take for example Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobash (R).  Ran on a platform of stopping voter fraud.  His multi-million dollar investigation found something like 6 cases, 3 of which were clearly non-intentional, (a 90 year old woman who mailed in her vote, then forgot and showed up at a voting precinct.)

If there is actual systemic voting fraud, it's done through the means of mail-in voting and/or manipulating the electronic voting machines.

You should note, however, that the GOP has no interest in investigating that.",70,0,1444235055,1444725128
