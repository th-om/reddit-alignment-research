cvvsghm,0,t1_cvvqvqj,DisGateway,"*WWE has more than 625 full-time employees and 120 performers who are independent contractors, the same as actors or actresses on television dramas, soaps or comedies.  They do not have corporate responsibilities or duties. WWE’s main roster talent work and travel four and a half days a week with annual compensation ranging from $250,000 to millions. WWE pays for all in-ring related injuries and any associated rehabilitation. Additionally, WWE leads the entertainment industry with its Talent Wellness Program, which is administered independently by renowned medical professionals and includes cardiovascular testing, ImPACT™, testing for brain function, substance abuse and drug testing, annual physicals, and health care referrals. The performers are contractually responsible for securing their own insurance to cover everyday health maintenance and ailments.

Several talent are incorporated, have agents or professional managers who handle contract negotiations with WWE. Additionally, many also have accountants or financial advisors to oversee their finances and investments, just like other entertainers and everyday people. Under WWE’s Talent Life Skills program, WWE offers mandatory workshops to its contracted performers to assist them in these matters.

WWE has evolved over the years to address talent needs and squarely places our talents’ health and well-being as our top priority. Without our talent, WWE would simply not exist*
