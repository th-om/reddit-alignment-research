cvw8pkf,0,t1_cvw6nqy,harsesus,">Technically, employers pay half, but when we consider hiring new employees we look at how much they will cost in total (salary+SS+benefits), not just their salary.

And hiring costs are effected by tax and/or contribution requirements in  Scandinavia, too.

>We'd pay employees more if we didn't need to pay the extra 7.5% tax. 

I highly doubt that. Employers are motivated to pay the lowest market rate possible to retain an effective employee.  They don't just start handing out cash for shits and giggles.  

 >So employees do, in fact, indirectly pay for at least some of the ""business half"" of SS.  It's the same argument used when people say, ""businesses don't pay corporate taxes, those costs are passed on to consumers"".

Then we'd have to start futzing around with how much more Swedish pay rates are effected by taxes, muddying the waters further, and this shit starts to loose all meaning.

>I think I wrote ""average"" instead of ""median"", but copy and pasted from the article:  
""*...including both employer and employee contributions, was $16,029 in 2013, or 23 percent of median family income...*""

The article says the average is 21% for everyone, only families are at 23%. 


>Again, most of us don't technically pay for all of our health insurance, however, like the employer-paid half of SS, we still eat much of that cost in reduced salary.

As I'm sure some business costs are eating by employees or consumers everywhere. As does unemployment rate have an effect on pay rate.  As does job mobility.    A myriad of factors effect pay rate, but it isn't relevant.

That doesn't add up, 10 percent plus about 7.5 perfect for payroll - employers pay half. So 18%.

>When including mandatory health insurance (covered by Scandanavian countries), and when health insurance is included we actually pay tax rates around 50% (except the rich, who pay far, far less). 

The article stated 21% (not 23), plus 18% for tax and you still only get 39%.  Still a shit deal for us when you weigh in all the services they get for the money, tho.

cvvn8p6,0,t1_cvvje9t,harsesus,">And the top rate in Denmark is 60.2%, and roughly 57% in Sweden, yet Bernie favors a 90% rate.

That only applies to the top income earners, and only the 'last mile' (over like 500k I think he said).  You really can't compare unless were talking about *effective tax rates*.

 * In the US wealthy (over $250k+) currently pay [around 22% (or 23% for $1m+.)](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/chart-day-effective-tax-rates-income-category)
 * In Sweden (for over 300k) the effective take rate is double, [at around 50%.](http://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-highest-effective-personal-tax-rates-2013-1)

Raising the *marginal tax rate* from 39% to 90% only on income 500+ *will* raise the effective rate, sure. But working out the effect that will have on the current 22% effective rate is **a lot** more complicated, and effects a much smaller subset of earnings than the current top bracket.  

> The corporate tax is substantially lower in all of the Scandinavian countries, and Bernie wants to raise ours. 

Our 39% *statutory corporate tax rate* is the highest in the world.  But again, the *effective tax rate* is a different story, and much much harder to pin down due to our crazy number of available exemptions.  On average , the US effective corporate tax rate is only about *[2% higher](http://www.forbes.com/sites/taxanalysts/2015/03/25/the-truth-about-corporate-tax-rates/),  ^(the average of line 3A), than the rest of OECD countries.*  Upping it wouldn't put us too far ahead of the average. 

> The taxes on the poor are much higher in Scandinavia (25% VATs, for example), Sanders as far as I know wants to keep them the same.

Definitely true in and of itself, but you have to look at the larger picture.  Benefits in Scandinavia for the poor are vastly superior - full access to healthcare, free college, free housing, welfare benefits, etc etc.  Much more wealth is transferred to the poor there, even with a high VAT, than the US could ever dream of getting close to.

>How is a union-corporate negotiation of wages that varies by sector MORE left wing than a $15 minimum wage

That really isn't something you can quantify as 'more (or less) left wing'. We have low unionization rates, unlike Sweden, and so for our left, a minimum wage hike is usually the go-to way to raise bottom tier wages.  They lack the negotiating power you see in Sweden, so our politicians typically work it out instead, for better or worse.  Apples and oranges, man. And min. wage hikes are pretty uncontroversial, here.  Policies to raise unionization rates very likely would be considered 'more left', depending on the policy. 

>No, I'm calling him that because that's that he is. When he's advocating policies that are to the left of social democracies, which are to themselves left wing, he's far left.

Most of his policies would be considered fairly average in most of Scandinavia.  Especially when you factor in the taxation and political nuances specific to the United States.  Single payer, the wealthy paying more tax, tuition free public higher ed, etc.  The wealth transfers to the poor and middle class he campaigns for typically already exist there.  They not only aren't controversial, they are only part of what is provided.",2,0,1444551520,1444719265
cvvmebq,0,t1_cvvf671,harsesus,">In Sweden and Denmark most people have 49% to 60% of their income taxed. 48% of their GDP go to taxes. 

Not corect, the top tax tier is 56.6% (we top out at 39%) and the *effective tax rate* (what people really end up paying) averages around [38 percent](https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2012/10/blogs/graphic-detail/20121020_inc285_0.png)...

Now compared to the US, it is a lot higher.  [The effective tax rate for most Americans is around 10.1%.](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/chart-day-effective-tax-rates-income-category)  **edit:** Plus private insurance (21%) and SS/Medicare (6.2% +1.45% )   **So we are coming in right around the Swedes at 39%** with a LOT less to show for it in terms of government services. If you are super wealthy here its a sweet deal.  With  insurance (which is a fixed amount not a percentage) and FICA (on *only* on the first 110k)  you might only add as little as few percentage points.
