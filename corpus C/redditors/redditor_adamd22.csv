cvp4gff,0,t1_cvow79s,adamd22,"Well then your family are sexist pricks. That is if they're all like that. It's possible you might just be applying brotherly/sisterly hate a bit too seriously though. 

Either way don't let yourself be put down by them. Just remind yourself of the fact that you can feel good about your healthy lifestyle, whilst they have to put other people down to allow them to feel better about themselves because their collective lifestyle is terrible.",1,0,1444067186,1444731736
cvos7wd,1,t3_3nhrnd,adamd22,"If you have the willpower to maintain your current, healthy lifestyle, odds are you'll be a good example to everyone in that household. I wouldn't move out, just try and improve your (younger?) siblings lives.",5,0,1444041931,1444731736

cviptyc,1,t3_3mulqk,adamd22,"I don't actually believe this story. I love Palahniuk but first of all, he is known for telling white lies on origins and meanings to Fight Club. Second of all, I don't believe for a second that no one would ask about injuries. Maybe it's just where I live (northern England) but if you got a bruise, even one that you don't even know where you've gotten it from, if it's visible, people will ask.",2,0,1443570859,1444731736

Also you seem to have avoided the fact yet they can also rely on uranium, and other nuclear fuels. Canada isn't powerless to US trading relationships, is what I'm getting at. They have oil and uranium.",1,0,1443548908,1444731736

cvgsxz7,0,t1_cvgo1bg,adamd22,"Limitless was great though. It never pointed out that 10% of your brain thing, all it said was that it increased potential. It was almost, dare I say it, *realistic*. Compared with telekinesis of course. In limitless it only makes him insanely perceptive and clever. In my opinion, a great film.",3,0,1443443692,1444731736
