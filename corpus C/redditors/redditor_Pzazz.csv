Who cares about the GOA, if federal law can supersede it?

How does registration always lead to confiscation? Logically speaking, they A re distinct actions. Perhaps you're attempting to apply the fallacy of the slippery slope?",0,0,1444135644,1444717488

cu2o9co,1,t3_3gxb51,Pzazz,"So wait... You're gonna use events in world-famously corrupt *Greece* as an indictment on the Canadian state? Lololololol please tell me you're trolling.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't y'all have the most right-wing government in place that you've have in decades? And you're gonna blame even the lefties for that?! Maybe I'm missing something, but from here it just looks like you forgot the punchline.

Oh, we'll show them by Not Voting! That'll teach them *munches on potato chips* there's no way that not showing up could hurt us, or let us miss an opportunity!

Let's use Mao! There's no way his method could ever backfire into an exploitative Capitalist/Neo-Fascist regime that strips works of their rights for private profit!

Oh, you're using his ideas to justify emulating occupy, without any of the other work that a handful did afterwards?

You better learn some better rhetoric and logic, or you're gonna have a pile of spare leaflets to use as napkins. Nobody will take them from the apparent lunatic you're gonna sound like to those voters.

Nevermind that Occupy didn't really accomplish much on its own, related to how the country is actually run. Still waiting on the occupy everywhere revolution! Oh wait, instead it gave us *candidates* that came out of the woodwork to serve actual socialist programs on the official ballots. Bernie's even getting tea party voters' attention in a good way.

Occupy Sandy was amazing. The rolling jubilee still needs love. But most of the rest is simply a flop.",-13,0,1439553395,1444717488

cu2gkrq,1,t3_3gxb51,Pzazz,"Uhm... I don't see the point. Maybe I'm out of the loop about something?

 I don't see how protesting an election will do anything but turn your cause into a joke. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't most forms of non-anarchist socialism kinda demand a state to keep capital and capitalism in check, or even to replace it entirely?

And someone please explain to me the Anarchists' fetish for ""not voting to delegitimize the system"", as if that actually did anything to remove it. Legitimate or not, nobody is going to sweep the current government away for you. That Capitalist govenment will still exist and demand taxes to stupidly subsidize some captialists' profits. It'll even claim more legimacy because you've told perfectly good voters to avoid standing against this with their ballots.

By protesting free elections, you seem to thumb your nose at the premise of popular sovereignty, a cornerstone of any Socialism I'd consider supporting. Barring some hypothetical extenuating circumstances being common knowledge, it sounds like you don't think your countrymen are good enough to think of vote for themselves. If that happens to be the case, fuck off you parasitic wanker. If that happens to be wrong, understand that many will take your protest as that sort of madness.

Rather than complaining that you don't have decent choices to vote for, go *make* one. If your candidate / party isn't well recieved, start smaller and *build* up. Join a party that pretends to represent workers to your standards, and raise hell there! Or start your own.

Don't just stand in the way of sovereign citizens making their choices, like some petulant child. I don't like where my country is going either... So I talk with Tea Party voters, laugh with them, complain with them, and charm them into opening their minds to hear what we're actually about. Each election day that I do that has done more than any 3-neckbeard protest will ever accomplish.",-5,0,1439527100,1444717488
