>What is the action? Being sexually active is the natural state for humans, so that is not an action; that's the default state.

This seems a bit ridiculous to me. Do you believe non-custodial parents should not be forced to pay child support, because 'being sexually active is the natural state for humans' and they therefore did not perform an action and so can't be held responsible for the consequences of it? Do you believe parents should be free to leave their children in the woods to starve to death because 'being sexually active is the natural state for humans' and they therefore did not perform an action and so can't be held responsible for the consequences of it? Why should some behavior's classification as 'the natural state for humans' preclude holding those humans responsible for the consequences of engaging in that natural behavior? I don't see how it follows.

If they actually completely precluded something, it wouldn't happen.

>one only needs demonstrate that they have taken reasonable care.

I'm not a lawyer so I could be mistaken, but my understanding is that taking reasonable care will usually mean you're not guilty of criminal offenses and that you won't be forced to pay punitive damages civilly. I am not aware, though readily admit I could just be ignorant, of any circumstance where you won't still be held responsible for compensatory damages. There are even cases where taking reasonable precautions won't get you off the hook criminally. In many states, if you have sex with a minor, it doesn't matter how hard you tried to make sure she was legal. If she was in fact underage, you are guilty.

>There is absolutely no precedent to assign such an obligation to any random person.

I don't know about 'any random person', but there certainly is such an obligation for some people. Non-custodial parents, for example, are forced to pay child support.

In the case of child support, to specific individuals.

>The right to life is derivative of the right to the security of the person.

Sure, but people can lose rights as a result of their actions. It's not inconsistent to say that the woman (or anyone else, though biologically it's going to happen to women a lot more often) loses her right to the security of her person if, through her willful action, she causes another person's life to depend on her body. It's analogous to how prisoners lose their right to freedom as a result of their actions, or how an armed home invader loses the right to security of his own person as a result of his actions.",1,0,1444063524,1444724226

>More importantly, the right to life is a negative, not positive, right.

Huh? The right to life isn't something the exists outside of our brains and legal systems. Some people believe in a negative right to life, others believe in a negative and positive right to life. They don't even have to be mutually compatible, since people are quite capable of believing mutually contradictory things.

>One has the right not to be deprived of life, but one is not necessarily entitled to the means necessary to live, and certainly not from any private individual.

That's of course a matter of opinion, and one that I've been arguing is inconsistent with the values of the average person. If you willfully caused a person to be in a position where he needs assistance to survive, many people would say you have an obligation to keep him alive, or in other words that he has a positive right to life at your expense. The degree to which your actions were malicious would of course affect their judgment as to your exact responsibility.

That is an opinion, and one that's certainly not going to be generally held in some extreme circumstances, and may not generally be held in some ordinary circumstances.

cvomqsa,0,t1_cvoa2z4,Juan_de_Mariana,">Show me the studies that have done this please.

I'm sure you're already aware of them, but many are referred to here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence

I think that page summarizes it well. There's no conclusive evidence that the difference in observed IQ between races is due to genetics, and we know of several environmental factors that can explain away part of the gap, but not all of it.

>Race being understood to be a social construct by the entire academic world would be a strong reason.

You're suggesting that it's impossible to tell what part of the world someone's ancestors lived in based on their DNA?

>It would be like expecting there to be intelligence differences between people with long hair vs short hair.

If two groups of people evolved separately long enough and in a different enough environment that one group's hair on average grew significantly longer than the other, I would not be surprised if those environmental differences also caused there to be group differences in other traits.

>Even if you could find some kind of difference, the arbitrary distinction of hair length probably has nothing to do with it, and the differences would be due to other factors.

There would be no causal link between hair length and intelligence. That doesn't mean there isn't a correlation, meaning some other factor (i.e. genetic differences) causes both.

>Which you have been very stingy with. The only evidence I could find has been thoroughly picked apart by the academic world as junk. Either the scientists were behaving unethically, or there were gaping holes in the methodology used.

Most of the research intelligent people in this debate use to inform their opinion has not been 'picked apart...as junk'. It has been alleged that it doesn't control for all of the relevant variables. So far, the relevant variables have not been shown to fully explain the observed difference, and there's no good reason to believe they will.

>Besides that, there are also studies which show the IQ gap going away completely when controlling for certain factors.

There are studies that show virtually anything. There are no conclusive and widely accepted studies that show that.

>The variables that we know how to control for. There are other variables that we cannot control for, that could have large effects.

Of course. Until a genetic basis is found for intelligence, there's no way we can be sure there's a genetic basis for the observed IQ difference between races.

>Saying one race is less intelligent than another is the definition of inferior, and is 100% what you are arguing.

'Inferior' has certain connotations which are absolutely not implied by researchers in this area or many of the people debating it. You know that, and you're trying to poison the well.

>The position is that it isn't unless you can provide proof. There currently is no proof, and therefore saying it is so anyway makes no sense.

There is plenty of circumstantial evidence. There is no conclusive proof. The default position is that you go where the evidence leads, always being willing to change your mind if better evidence comes along. Right now, evidence suggests, but does not conclusively prove, that the average difference in intelligence between the races can't be entirely explained by environmental factors.

>null hy·poth·e·sis
noun
(in a statistical test) the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between specified populations, any observed difference being due to sampling or experimental error.

This tells me you don't really understand the point of the null hypothesis. There can be more than one reasonable null hypothesis for some subject of study. It does not have to be the assumption that there are no differences between two groups. It can be if it makes sense to make it that, but it's always a judgment call. The null hypothesis when measuring two distinct species would almost certainly not be that their average attributes are identical.

>I'm guessing you know that evolution cannot work on a time scale that short.

I don't see any reason why the prevalence of certain genes can't measurably change within such a short time period, especially if there's some large change in the environment. I doubt that's what's going on with the Flynn effect, but who knows.

>Therefore, the increase in white IQ had to be solely because of environmental factors. If the rise was possible for Group A, why is the same rise not possible for Group B?

Did blacks not experience the same rise already? You seem to be assuming that if it's possible for Group A, it's possible to happen twice for Group B. I don't see any particularly good reason to make that assumption.

>This could be a major factor in lowering scores for certain groups, but no studies can really take it into account due to it being a mental barrier.

Well, by the null hypothesis, I will assume it doesn't explain the gap fully until there is evidence otherwise.

>You'd have to show how the environment would select for this in one area and not in another

What do you mean by 'show'? We can make guesses about why the environment might have had some effect or other, but we can't exactly run the experiment. We can see how our guesses line up with available evidence, but it will be tough or impossible to prove causality.

>Skin color is not as hard to change as the entire potential of the human brain, so you are comparing apples and oranges.

What reason do you have for that claim? The null hypothesis should be that they are equally easy to change, because they are both based on genetics.

>I'm not following how this analogy is relevant.

I may have been mistaken, but my impression of your argument was this: if there is more variation between members of some group than there is between the average of that group and some other group, then there can be no causal link between the trait being measured and the trait used to separate that group. I gave you an example where there absolutely must be a causal link between the trait being measured and the trait used to separate the groups, despite there being more variation within the groups than between the group averages.

>Unless you are claiming that large scale genetic variations can happen in a population in the span of about 4 decades

Why would the genetic change shown by the study be hard to believe? It showed that blacks in the south had about 10% more African lineage than blocks in the north. All that would be necessary is a somewhat higher rate of race mixing. What of that sounds unreasonable to you?

I'm not sure why you're pretending like there are only two choices: IQ is determined solely by race, or race has no effect on IQ. The answer is somewhere in between. If IQ was determined solely by race, then all people of 100% European ancestry would have identical IQs. That's obviously not the case. If race had no effect on IQ, then, when corrected for all other factors, the average IQ of whites and blacks and asians would be identical. That doesn't seem likely, given the evidence, and there's no compelling reason why we should expect it to be the case in the first place.

>Other than having a vested interest in proving scientific racism is correct, I cannot see why someone would default to the explanation that has zero evidence supporting it rather than other easily provable explanations.

There is tons of evidence supporting it, some better than others. There is no conclusive evidence proving it, because as far as I know, no specific genes have been causally linked to higher IQ.

>Such as 40% of black children growing up in poverty for example.

Which is why researchers, who aren't idiots like you're trying to make them out to be, correct for socioeconomic status, and have found the gap in the average persists.

>It does actually.

No, it doesn't. No one doubts that factors other than race have an effect on IQ. That doesn't mean race can't also be a factor. How do you not understand that?

>The null hypothesis is the one that states there are no differences between the races in IQ.

I'm not sure I'm even willing to give you this. Different groups of humans clearly evolved separately enough, for long enough, and in different enough environments that different genes affecting skin color and musculature were selected among the different groups. I don't see any good reason to assume the differences in environment had no effect on selecting for different IQ levels.

If you encountered two distinct species, your null hypothesis wouldn't be that all of their trait averages are identical to one another. Why would your null hypothesis be that two different races of the same species have identical average traits? I would be more surprised to find out that the averages were the same than I would that the averages were different.

>Therefore, the proof is on you to show that the alternative claim is true (that the substantial differences in IQ is mainly caused by genetic inferiority).

And quite a lot of work has been done testing this and providing evidence for this claim. And no one said anything about inferiority except you.

>Again, considering that the average white person in the year 1950 had the equivalent IQ of the average black person today, would you say that there was some kind of genetic mutation that occurred within the entire white population over the course of 50 years, or did other factors cause the jump in IQ points?

It could be that selective pressures have caused genes associated with greater intelligence to become more prevalent in each race. It could be that other factors have caused the increase. It doesn't change the fact that there remains a gap, even when correcting for as many other variables as possible.

>These are in the studies I linked in my first post. This seems to be evidence that you didn't at least skim any of my links.

>I'm not sure if you're being intentionally obtuse or not, but I'll explain it in simplest possible terms just to be safe.

I am not being intentionally obtuse, though I will always admit I might be missing something.

>The idea is that if there exists an even greater difference between people of the same race, there must be something other than race that is causing the gap. This undermines your point.

I'm sorry but I don't follow the logic here.

Let's say I have 100 young tomato plants in my garden. I randomly select 50 of them, and I give those 50 a special fertilizer. Other than that, I treat them all the same. After 10 weeks, I find that the average height of the specially fertilized plants is 130 cm, and the average height of the other plants is 110 cm, and that the standard deviation in both groups is 30 cm. So, there is more variation within the groups than there is between the groups. Should I conclude that the fertilizer had no effect on the height of the plants? That would seem ridiculous to me, but it sounds like that's what you're suggesting.

>No. Even blacks who live in the same geographical areas will live in different places than whites, and have lower incomes. This is insufficient.

And that's why researchers control for socioeconomic status of the parents, and use studies like children of various races that were adopted at young ages by wealthy white parents. It's well known that socioeconomic status can be a factor, so researchers have controlled for it.

>These studies have all been called into question either by bad methodology or new information.

It doesn't prove my point, it's just a possible explanation for why blacks in the north score higher than blacks in the south.

>There are larger differences in IQ between people of the same race

From what I've seen, the difference between the white average and the black average is about 1 standard deviation. How are you comparing the differences between the populations with differences inside the populations? I'm also not sure why this comparison is particularly meaningful in the first place.

>To show that in certain situations, blacks would score better depending on how you looked at the data.

Which as I said no one doubts is true.

>If we observe that southerners have lower IQs than northerners, and most black people live in the south, how much of that IQ difference is due to that geographical fact?

We can control for that by measuring IQs of whites and blacks that live in the same geographical area. 

>There are so many other, measurable factors that will affect IQ, that using it as evidence that one race is smarter than another is reaching at best, disingenuous at worst.

And that's why many studies have been done to control for those factors as best as possible. They all find there is a clear difference between the average black IQ and the average white IQ -- studies of children of different ancestry adopted and raised by wealthy whites, etc..

Regarding why blacks in the north seem to be smarter than blacks in the south, there is one likely factor I can think of. It's been well established in studies that blacks with higher African ancestry score lower on IQ tests than blacks with less African ancestry, and this study from 23andme says blacks in the south tend to have higher African ancestry.
