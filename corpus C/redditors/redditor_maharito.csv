I want Donald Trump to be the Speaker AND President at the same time.  Then no one could stand in his way of making America GREAT again.

Well, at least make America something that's really big.",5,0,1444355367,1444724756
cvt7ohw,0,t1_cvswfd9,maharito,This just fits so well poetically with my personal theory that Boehner stepped down because he finally couldn't stop ignoring his conscience after his lifelong dream came true and showed how far he'd fallen from his own personal ideals.,36,0,1444354339,1444724756
