cvuaoir,1,t3_3o53v8,Fr33zy159,"> So far, it's just the president visiting a town after a tragedy...but people have been preemptively complaining about politicization of the tragedy before it's even happened, which is a politicization of the tragedy in itself

> It just seems like pro-gun activists have completely jumped the shark with Obama's visit. They're literally using this tragedy to make a political statement against using this tragedy to make political a statement...

Obama's own statement about the shooting:
""“And, of course, what’s also routine is that somebody, somewhere, will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue. Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.""

The people of the town don't want him there. They want to grieve and move on. The county that the shooting took place in owns lots of guns and the people there are pro gun. They refuse to be used as props in an ignorant anti-gun agenda by the President. It is as simple as that. They aren't activists, they are citizens who want to be left alone.
