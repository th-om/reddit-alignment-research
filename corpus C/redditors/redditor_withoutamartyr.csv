I saw a post that mentioned something about birds, and the comment chain went thus:

""he knows nothing about bird law""
""birdperson, ace attorney""
""Harvey birdman, attorney at law""
""did you get that thing I sent ya?""

No context. No comments in between. Just free association centered around a loose theme. And that's the problem with the references. Its just a ""hey I've seen that too"" circlejerk. ",1,1,1444691634,1444718282

cvvynqq,1,t3_3ob07p,withoutamartyr,"I have a friend who works there. He didn't say what caused the alarm but they have a really good policy about return tickets, if you come back with your ticket or receipt at another show time. He said they passed out passes to the crowd after a bit but I imagine a lot of people had left before hand. But yeah if you want to go back they'll comp you a ticket and I don't think it even has to be to the same movie. ",10,0,1444584199,1444718282

There was nothing empirical about what you said, and calling you out for trying to make your problems seem worse than another person's because of your gender isn't ""nitpicking phrasing"". Don't try to wiggle out of this one by saying you were just stating facts, or using logical fallacy terminology. You said a shitty thing and you said it in a shitty way. ",2,0,1444528331,1444718282
