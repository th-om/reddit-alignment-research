Yeah she could probably cut down on comcast, but internet is kind of a must have these days.  As a country we allowed comcast to become a monopoly and this is the end result, they charge whatever they want.

I'm just pointing out that the welfare queen stereotype is often brought up to distract people from the fact that we need to fix the healthcare system.  Its fine to be concerned with Fraud and Abuse but try talking about real people and not these obvious fake stories that get passed around.

cvx8amc,0,t1_cvx7vjt,worksaf,"> Is it so horrible that we prevent people on assistance from purchasing cigarettes and alcohol? Is it so horrible that we prevent people on food stamps from spending $120 on Comcast each month?

You do know that both of those things are not free right?  There is implicit overhead costs involved that aren't always justified.  If you spend twice as much on an inefficient system that prevents people from buying beer while on welfare than you would be simply going with a more basic system without those checks than what is the point?  

Maybe if you are concerned with what they are buying we should try harder to not let them get there in the first place?  

Also the post was speaking about healthcare, and we have the highest healthcare costs in the world.  I know people who work in the medical supply and insurance industries and they will be the first to admit its all a scam.  You and me keep arguing over how much welfare to cut before poor people decide to spend $500 a month on a personal health insurance policy instead of asking why we cannot implement a better system overall that doesn't require that in the first place.  

Many conservatives are against single payer, or national healthcare, and are against welfare.  So it literally does come down to are you willing to let people die on the floor of the ER if they can't pay? Should people be driven to bankrupcy if they get sick without insurance?  These are real, every day scenarios that don't get talked about because gullible people would instead rather share fake stories about poor people with iPhones getting free healthcare.",3,0,1444677030,1444717123
cvx7sxk,1,t3_3ohau9,worksaf,"The entire post is your typical baby boomer fantasy argument filled with nonsense.

> Dear Mr. President: During my shift in the Emergency Room last night, I had the pleasure of evaluating a patient whose smile revealed an expensive Shiny gold tooth, whose body was adorned with a wide assortment of elaborate and costly tattoos, who wore a very expensive Brand of tennis shoes and who chatted on a new cellular telephone equipped with a popular R&B ringtone.

This says Black people could get jobs with healthcare but choose to buy iPhones instead.  Not only that but its inclusion implies there are so many people like this we should dismantle our social safety nets solely out of spite to teach these people a lesson.

> I happened to notice that her payer status was listed as ""Medicaid""! During my examination of her, the patient informed Me that she smokes more than one costly pack of cigarettes every day and somehow still has money to buy pretzels and beer

Again with the fake scenario implying most black/poor people fit this scenario.  Also implies most welfare money goes to cigarettes and beer.  

> And, you and our Congress expect me to pay for this woman's health care?

Implying the cost comes straight out of her own pocket and is not handled through taxes like all other things the government does. 

> I contend that our nation's ""health care crisis"" is not the Result of a shortage of quality hospitals, doctors or nurses.

An argument, nobody is making, meant to generate an emotional response so you agree with them that healthcare professions are hard work.

> Rather, it is the result of a ""crisis of culture"", a culture in which it is perfectly Acceptable to spend money on luxuries and vices while refusing to take care of one's self or, heaven forbid, purchase health insurance. It is a culture based on the irresponsible credo that ""I can do whatever I want to because someone else will always take care of me"". Once you fix this ""culture crisis"" that rewards irresponsibility and dependency, you'll be amazed at how quickly our nation's health care Difficulties will disappear.

More saying that Black and/or poor people are only in their positions of their own fault and nobody else has any responsibility for their position in life.  Moreover, we should not change anything about our current system except to just get rid of all welfare which will force all these poor people to get jobs and stop stealing rich people's money.

Are there?  You know this how? Maybe instead of arguing over how this or that person should move their money around to be able to afford healthcare we should instead be trying to bring the costs down for everyone and stop letting insurance companies scam both citizens and the government.
