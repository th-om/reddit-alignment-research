>Hi.

>I'd like to address several misconceptions around these posts.

>Actual brigading really is NOT one of our bigger problems. Users certainly believe it is, and it does occur, but the vast majority of reports we get asking us to look into brigading turn out to be false alarms. 

>It's also a fallacy to think that non-participation links are the solution. There's a reason we have never supported them - they're irrelevant to anyone who turns CSS off or uses an app. In the cases where users are actively attempting to brigade, they're aware of that and already trying to get around those limitations. We’re not going to adopt a method that’s broken out of the box. We are working on actual tools to address those problem situations, but they're still in the early stages. It's a complex problem and a robust solution is going to take some time.

>The bigger problem is subreddits with antagonistic relationships engaging in games of baiting each other into responding and then crying about brigading, in many cases where there is none actually occurring. After the initial post went up, we received a flood of reports complaining about it being a call for brigade. I understand that /r/shitredditsays subscribers find the listed subreddits obnoxious and offensive and possibly vice versa, but posts like that don’t accomplish anything positive. It looked aggressive, drew more negative attention to your subreddit, and resulted in a lot of complaints to us (although there was no actual brigading detected as a result of it). There was a lot of time wasted all due to a failed attempt at satire and I’d prefer that not happen again. ",1,0,1444721353,1444721906

So white people (77.7% of the US) commit 66% of rape? And black people (13% of the US) commit 31.% of rapes? That means

>which is more than what black people are doing, which means we are, in fact, more likely to do it

is false, same with arson (and murder and robbery and assault and most crimes)
