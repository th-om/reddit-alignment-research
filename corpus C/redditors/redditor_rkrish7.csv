cvx5ytv,0,t1_cvx5v4v,rkrish7,"Okay got it, thanks. To me the argument doesn't hold much water since sources like Al Jazeera and RT aren't reporting it either, although I'm not sure the Kremlin would want this news getting out either. ",1,0,1444673670,1444716518
cvx55ia,0,t1_cvx4uif,rkrish7,"I'm not fully understanding your point, would you mind clarifying? Are you saying that the fact that the ""big media outlets"" are not reporting lends credibility to the claims from right wing sources, or are you saying that as a result of the big media outlets not reporting, the right wing sources are claiming that this is a NATO cover-up?

cvx1zep,1,t3_3ogtoc,rkrish7,"Not one reputable source is reporting this, so like the others are saying, it either didn't happen, or the Russians and Turks are working very hard to ensure that this news does not hit the front page. 

I don't even know what a Russia-NATO standoff would look like. ",7,0,1444667783,1444716518
cvwzy9r,1,t3_3oencb,rkrish7,"Every issue which campaigns highlight is a ""strategy issue"". Infrastructure isn't sexy, so people don't run on that as a main issue, but protecting tradition/being progressive are, so that is what politicians care about. ",2,0,1444664561,1444716518
cvwzqc8,1,t3_3ogkll,rkrish7,"Imagine you thought that people were killing babies all the time because they didn't want to raise the kid. Wouldn't you be upset?

This is why I oppose Obama's nomination to the SCOTUS, I want the judges to be as apolitical as possible. The fact that the conservative candidates are making sweeping claims about what prerequisites they want for justices is scary enough, but if Dems did it too, that would seriously hurt the integrity of the court.

cvtxu4a,0,t1_cvtaapr,rkrish7,"Not necessarily, many of the appeals judges on the DC Circuit won by 60-40ish margins. The fact that he was confirmed 97-0 says a lot about how well he was regarded. the fact that he clerked for Sandra Day O'Connor probably helped his standing with conservatives.
