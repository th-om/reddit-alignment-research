Marty travels back in time and runs over a tree. Fast forward back to 1985 and the mall has been renamed Lone Pine mall. No stone was left unturned.",2,0,1444687876,1444723568

In short, *Being and Time* has no logical connection with the Nazi regime. There is a very terse documentary on YouTube surveying the connections between Heidegger and the Nazi regime which might inform you better than I. That aside, *Being and Time* should be considered crucial to any continental/existentialist education. His phenomenology is nearly unparalleled and the project in this book is unrealistically ambitious. I think Heidegger is at his best in discovering one's own Being in relation to one's own death. That's where he hits hardest. Don't let *ad hominem* jabs at his personal life color your experience. The timeless aphorism rings true that we should judge a philosopher not by his greatest folly, but by his greatest achievement.",0,0,1444341777,1444723568

Longer answer: Continental philosophy is, in many ways, as rigorous as analytic philosophy. It's often *not* as straightforward and clear. But if you have any eye for literature, then you might enjoy it more. I find it more ""fun"" because Continental is at its best in the prose. Nietzsche, for example, writes in a captivating manner such that, even if you don't agree with him, you feel the sheer weight and scope of the piece. Continental tends not to get caught up in the ruts that Analytic does, such as Gettier and Frankfurt cases (where all you're arguing is a response to an objection in reply to a counterexample of the original piece; that can rapidly get tedious).

Poke around in some existentialism and you might enjoy yourself. But stay away from Heidegger and Derrida if you're popping the Continental cherry, they can be a *bit* impossible when you don't already have your footing.",5,0,1443750004,1444723568
