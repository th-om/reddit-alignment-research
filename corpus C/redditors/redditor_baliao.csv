cvttf52,0,t1_cvt46r7,baliao,"I was terrified when I was called for jury duty. Having someone else's life in my hands, having to balance justice and mercy is more responsibility than I want to have. I vote religiously. I pay attention to politics. But when I miss a vote I don't cry about it. I understand subconsciously that my one abstention is not enough to change the results. I also understand that we need to discourage thinking like that because there are consequences if large numbers of people do so. But it's something we all intuitively grasp either way. 


If, on the other hand, my chances of deciding the nation's policy on a close vote were pretty darn respectable, as would be the case in reasonably sized sampling, I imagine I would treat it much more like jury duty. Compensating the members of the sampling for their time frees them up to participate but we must not forget that rational ignorance also falls away. Also, they, being representative of the citizen body, will face the consequences of their decisions in the same proportion as the population as a whole and they will understand that, at times, the nation's course on an issue will be decided by a single member's vote.


The indoctrination issue is a serious concern and why I favor the format I do. Selecting policy advocates by lottery would be troublesome, because you run the risk of introducing a random bias. Not everyone has the same degree of charisma. Speaking persuasively is a skill. To select speakers by lottery you'd need a vast sample. A sample large enough that the skilled and charismatic subset is itself statistically significant. Since so many things are subjective, a lecture-style format is out of the question. What is needed is a balanced advocacy process with both supporters and opponents having making their case back and forth. Elections, when designed well, can get you ideologically diverse public speakers who have all the incentive in the world to make their case and provide an effective counterbalance against their opposite numbers.




>In many cases people cannot even make decision that they want to. 

Fair enough. If you were referring to conventional electoral models of representative democracy then I do agree with this to some extent. However, some states have proper initiative/referendum mechanisms. At present any issue deemed important enough can be handled by direct participation. But these states don't strike me as being better governed or as having more democratic policies on whole than the others. Politicians generally benefit from switching positions to match the public's shifting wishes. We can see the quick turnaround in support for gay marriage in Congress once it became clear that it was no longer an electoral loser. Representation through a principal-agent mechanism inherently involves some serious losses. Increasing the diversity of the agents is a good thing. They will be less different from the principals and so the losses are less troublesome. Again, I think proxy voting would be an improvement on the status quo, but I struggle to see how, over an arbitrary length of time, the overall outcomes will be all that different from what our current institutional tools can get us. Why would giving people the chance to vote on every matter result in a meaningful gain over just allowing people to vote on just the matters they deem to be most important? I suppose not all actions can be reversed in an after-the-fact referendum. But then again it's likely politicians are more knowledgeable about the issues in question than the average person. They also fear the ramifications of outcomes a few years down the road. I could see it helping in the case there is a substantive difference between the politicians and the public. Loose some, gain some. I absolutely believe we need a new model if we want to do much better than the status quo.

I fully support the existence of an initiative/referendum mechanism largely for reasons of legitimacy. If the voters don't act to overturn the actions of the sampling, then those actions gain implicit consent in addition to any legitimacy that comes from their statistical representivity. All three democratic tools complement each other well.",2,0,1444406978,1444716350
cvs5vyg,0,t1_cvrfvxd,baliao,"I think the paper is interesting, but ignores too much to bring in the word, ""provable."" The quality of a democratic decision-making process is a subjective thing which arguably goes well beyond the efficiency with which preferences are aggregated and values turned into aggregate-able preferences.

The influence of money remains a serious problem. Even in Switzerland, the world capital of democracy in the modern era, campaign funding is by far and away the best predictor of referenda results. This demonstrates, I believe, a deeper problem with conventional models of democracy... which is that we have busy lives. One person's vote is a drop in the bucket. So why should one invest enough time to become informed? How much time does the average person spend doing research before casting their vote? Some people spend a great deal of time. Yet parties and politicians spend truly vast sums on vacuous advertising that everyone seems to hate. Why? If it didn't work they wouldn't do it. Clearly enough voters—in both elections and referenda—are influenced in their decisions by vacuous reasons. I see no reason why a hybrid would not fall into the same trap. Would a citizen who does not take the time to become informed about the top two presidential candidates (or even bother to vote at all) really take the time to find a faithful proxy? Why? There are exactly zero personal consequences for failing to do so, besides a possible feeling of civic shame.

Not taking an interest in politics is perfectly fine. Not everyone is interested in the same things. Without sufficient interest however, the extent to which you and your needs are represented is minimal in both electoral and direct democracy and very likely proxy democracy as well. For delegation to work well you have to follow both the actions of your delegate and the issues themselves to some extent. This seriously eats into the time-savings you gain by delegating in the first place and so people will probably end up relying on trust far more than is merited. Some portion of the citizen body will no doubt delegate their votes and not give the matter another thought for a decade or longer if the mechanics of the system allow it. You can see the extent to which the electorate delegates its political will to various public figures, people like actors and talk show hosts, at present. In a proxy democracy context there's a real danger that these sorts of people will end up with significant political power not because they *represent* their supporters, but because they are *liked* by them. 

Now, with a statistical sampling we have a very different situation. There's no delegation and no delegation costs. There's a statistical margin of error, which is a very different beast. There's no rational ignorance when you are one vote out of a few hundred. Rather than a campaign you have something more reminiscent of a courtroom. The ability to persuasively argue your case before the jury-esque sampling is what would be decisive. 

I believe we ought to pursue the *considered judgement* of the people as our goal instead of simple aggregation. Allow supporters and opponents of a given proposal to have their say, back and forth in a moderated environment, and let a representative sampling of the people have time to think it over before they render their judgement. A lot like a conventional jury. But in this case a *representative* jury judging policy proposals.",1,0,1444278633,1444716350

cvr7tts,0,t1_cvqyyhs,baliao,"It's better to think in terms of a statistical sampling acting collectively, rather than filling conventional legislative seats by lottery. We would expect a statistical sampling of the people to vote—with some statistical margin of error of course—the way the whole citizen body would if they could devote themselves to political matters full-time. You lose rational ignorance and gain Condorcet's [jury theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet%27s_jury_theorem). The [crowd intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd) research is remarkably clear. A group of smart people is dumber than a group of cognitively diverse people. It's counterintuitive but absolutely true. For a really great survey of the work that has been done in this area I'd recommend Surowiecki's The Wisdom of Crowds.

There's some debate in pro-sortition corners over whether the randomly chosen members could handle the introduction of legislation themselves.  Proposal-generation is a technical job—as you allude to—but hiring advisors to draft bills is exactly what lawmakers do right now. There are other reasons to be less than keen on this though. If I had my way, I'd have a sampling at the heart of the political system and have a pool of elected officials each holding the power to propose legislation for a vote before the sampling. Basically partition the role of legislators into proposal-generators and decision-makers. Let the politicians introduce proposals and defend/debate them before a representative sampling of the people who actually decide the nation's policies.",1,0,1444223525,1444716350

Multi-winner majoritarian is little different from single-winner majoritarian.

The process of casting a rational vote should be as simple as possible to minimize the rational ignorance problem. Needing to make a decision on how to rank the better part of a dozen candidates moves us in exactly the opposite direction.
