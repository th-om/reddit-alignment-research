cvmyw1b,0,t1_cvmnd4q,gogodoctor26,"As a conscientious smoker, I'd like to add on to this. Just a few completely anecdotal points:

*If you drink around someone who isn't drinking, the alcohol doesn't directly affect them. Second hand smoke does lead to cancer among non-smokers. (This is just counting the actual compounds ingested. Obviously if someone drives drunk, that has a terrible effect on a lot of people)

*Alcohol in and of itself does not cause foul and offensive odors like cigarettes do (not accounting for personal hygiene habits). 

*Recently more alternatives to smoking have arisen that still give a person the chemical hit without being nearly as dangerous to bystanders (ecigs, etc). 

*I believe cigarettes and tobacco in general affect more parts of the body than alcohol does. That is to say that alcohol only damages the liver, while cigarette can cause cancer in the mouth, throat, lungs...pretty much everywhere. 

Again this is all anecdotal off the top of my head. If I'm wrong please feel free to correct me. ",20,0,1443897408,1444726816
