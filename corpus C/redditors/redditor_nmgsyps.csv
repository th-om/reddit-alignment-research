cvs2ok3,0,t1_cvs1olx,nmgsyps,"What I should have said to be more clear: If google wanted to be a national brand the size of Time Warner or Comcast TODAY, they could have plowed a huge amount of capital into it and tried to become an instant, national success. But, as you said, they are going the slow route because it's extremely costly to wire up even a single city, and they were not going to risk their entire company in establishing Google Fiber.",1,0,1444272011,1444722386
cvs0klc,1,t3_3nwp41,nmgsyps,"A ground war between U.S and Russia, or China is pretty much impossible. Either tensions will build and subside (this happened many times during the cold war with the Cuban Missile Crisis being the closest tensions didn't subside), or both powers will throw everything they have at eachother (including nuclear, chemical and possibly biological weapons). It is illogical that either country would fight a land war without engaging their nuclear arsenals, and after both countries have pummeled eachother with those, there won't be much left to fight over..",0,0,1444268551,1444722386
cvrzfri,0,t1_cvrphpb,nmgsyps,"A sane man in an insane place. It's sometimes easy to forget there are normal, sane people in a country that funds terrorism worldwide, beheads hundreds of its own citizens and is covering up a stampede that killed thousands. I definitely sympathize with many there, given that unless you are in the royal family (and probably have to be in the higher echelon) you have absolutely zero, zilch influence or voice in what the country does or stands for.

cvroouw,0,t1_cvre1vv,nmgsyps,"This is where I diverge incredibly from the left. I am all for the U.S letting in refugees. But not a single Muslim or a follower of the Islamic faith should be allowed refugee status. The Muslims already in the West cause enough problems by forcing their barbaric philosophies on their children, they voice their ""concerns"" by committing countless acts of terrorism, and there is an endless series of problems that this one community has. Meanwhile other immigrant religious groups :Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists do not cause 1/1000 of the trouble that the Islamists cause. So, the right choice is pretty obvious, no refugees from the Islamic world.",-1,0,1444249361,1444722386
cvriv5s,0,t1_cvrdbfe,nmgsyps,"If google wanted to be an actual national ISP, they would already crisscross the nation. The slow and very conservative growth of GF allows them to be a threat to major cable companies who want to charge more for bandwidth, but their fiber network is basically raising enough money to worry not investors.",2,0,1444240959,1444722386

The business probably won't be a thing anymore after getting a gigantic lawsuit for putting children in danger. In fact knowingly putting kids in danger may result in individual employees being liable (criminal or civil) depending on Montana law.",2,0,1444239844,1444722386
