Tristan Thompson and Mozgov both rebound, and the Hawks were weak at rebounding anyways.

Thabo was the only elite wing defender we had (DeMarre is better as a team defender than as a dedicated wing stopper), which you NEED when facing Lebron.",3,0,1444694232,1444724582

Furthermore, fetal homicide is a crime in the vast majority of states (38), so legally courts already recognize that fetuses have some protections of personhood.

It's insulting as fuck to imply that pro-life advocates are sexists on some agenda to strip power from women - and frankly when someone brings out that card I think it's absolutely fair to call them a baby-murderer.",5,0,1444666862,1444724582
