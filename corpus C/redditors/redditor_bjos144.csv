cvxmg66,1,t3_3oi12p,bjos144,"I get that Columbus was an asshole, but unlike the vikings, his visit to the Americas represented a massive change in the world.  Before him, there were no westerners in the Americas, after him, well, America.  Asshole or not, his landing in the Americas was HUGE fucking deal for all mankind.  That said, I dont care about Columbus day, but at least let's be honest about the fact that, first or not, his landing is the one that really counted.",8,0,1444698571,1444720016

The company will take back tattered rags without a receipt after 8 years without a question and give you store credit.  I know because that's how I just got two new pairs of 120 dollar pants for free.  Yeah, they're insanely expensive, but so fucking worth it.",2,0,1444637162,1444720016

cvvbyyd,1,t3_3o9v88,bjos144,"I'm going to preface this by saying I recommend against selling cars to friends in general.  A used car can have issues, and they can develop at any point.  Hypothetically if you sell this car to your friend and then it develops a serious issue, it can hurt feelings.

To avoid legal issues, agree upon a price.  Do this with an honest carfax and kelly blue book assessment of the value of the car.  Next, have the buyer (or if you're super generous, you) spend around 100 dollars on a 120 point inspection.  You two should both go over it before selling.

Make sure you dont have any leans on the car.  You should own it outright.  The next step is to agree on payment and head to the DMV, or even better AAA which does DMV services such as title transfers.  You sign the title, she signs the title and notes the milage and a few other minor details.  YOu then inform your insurance company as does she, and the car is sold.  The actual transaction takes about an hour.  She will receive a new title in the mail sometime that month.",1,0,1444524691,1444720016
