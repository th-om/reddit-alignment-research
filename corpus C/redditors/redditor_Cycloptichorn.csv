cvx856v,0,t1_cvx7zuh,Cycloptichorn,"Yup.  This is in large part why I support the elimination of welfare, and the recreation of the WPA.  If someone needs a job, we can give them a job, where they will learn skills and learn to work hard for a livable wage.  ",0,0,1444676808,1444716406
cvx828z,0,t1_cvx7ppe,Cycloptichorn,"The problem with this is that the skills that one learns as an engineer/scientist are not in fact directly translatable to the political arena.  Now, some might sneer at this, but that is (IMHO) as dumb as a non-scientist sneering at the idea that there are very specialized skills needed for a career in science, and that you can't just jump into it without training and hard work/experience at the lower levels.

I don't want an engineer or scientist to run for president, because I don't think they would necessarily do a good job.  Especially in Carson's case - if I needed a neurosurgeon, I'd knock on his door extremely fast.  If I need my car engine fixed, or my taxes done, or my country ran at the highest level, I have no reason to think that he actually knows anything about those topics at all.",2,0,1444676688,1444716406

While that might sound satisfying, it's actually a huge economic loss in the end, as these folks don't just lay around and die...",2,0,1444674931,1444716406
cvx6qid,1,t3_3ohau9,Cycloptichorn,"Just the modern version of the 'cadillicac-driving, welfare queen' story that Republicans rely upon to justify their disdain and derision of the poor and any social programs designed to support them.

What the doctor in question doesn't seem to understand is that woman's life is pretty crappy next to his or any other successful persons, and the 'expensive things' that she has are short-term purchases designed to increase what little happiness they have.  It's common to see lower-income individuals purchase things that are seemingly wasteful to you or I; it's a symptom of poverty, not the cause of their poverty.",2,0,1444674774,1444716406
cvx1flk,0,t1_cvx133o,Cycloptichorn,"That really was an embarrassing spectacle.  I've never understood why the GOP is so interested in the constant praise and worship of their former luminaries, and punishes so those who refuse to bow down.",1,0,1444666938,1444716406

This is a pretty clear sign that you don't understand what Reconciliation is used for.

Nevertheless, if you're right - why haven't they done so? Any explanation? ",4,0,1444503981,1444716406
