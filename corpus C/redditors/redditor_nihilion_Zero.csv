cvwnlek,1,t3_3oc2ne,nihilion_Zero,Kinda cool. Still an HP tho,2,0,1444627727,1444721707
cvuxwri,0,t1_cvuujat,nihilion_Zero,"You've offered a set of definitions but I don't believe they are consistent with those generally accepted by political scientists and legal scholars. You're essentially begging the question by defining a regulation as something which is undesirable, while you're confounding the generally accepted meaning of a regulation with 'law'. Like so many ""libertarians"", you've discovered a few concepts but don't appear to fully understand them, though none the less make sweeping and uncompromising judgments based upon them.

cvu0juo,0,t1_cvtwj1r,nihilion_Zero,"Well, yes. But in /u/mrhymer 's defense regulation is often one of those things which people cannot accomplish through voluntary cooperation.",6,0,1444417594,1444721707
cvt8jzm,1,t3_3o0tzn,nihilion_Zero,It's a good idea. Could work in Canada. But here I'm the states I suspect people will just hoard as many free Soylent bottles as they can so there will never actually be any.,2,0,1444355715,1444721707

cvo7aoo,1,t3_3ngt1a,nihilion_Zero,I don't really care anymore. The only way the major version updates affect me is that Google scrambles all the controls. That and they've been working hard to make everything brighter white and even more eye-straining. Does it browse the web better? No. Does it make calls better? No. Does it text message better? No. Does it do anything I actually need it to do better? No. So what's the fuss? ,-1,0,1443993143,1444721707
