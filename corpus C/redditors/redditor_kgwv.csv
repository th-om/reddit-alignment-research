cvvpytu,1,t3_3nkzy8,kgwv,"Here are some interesting passages:

 > Political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification.

 > Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers.

 > People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of unreliable elements.

Which can be condensed into the following:

 > In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.

for instance:

 > Consider for instance some comfortable English professor defending Russian totalitarianism. He cannot say outright, ‘I believe in killing off your opponents when you can get good results by doing so’. Probably, therefore, he will say something like this:
 >> While freely conceding that the Soviet regime exhibits certain features which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think, agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is an unavoidable concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigors which the Russian people have been called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement.

Concisely,

 > Political language — and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists — is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.

cvqglvc,0,t1_cvqfkby,kgwv,"I agree. I dislike the lack of citation. One attribution to this could be that he's a journalist and not an academic. Academics tend to (or ought to) cite everything if they can. Journalists cite nothing, historically, as the classical medium was print and there just wasn't the space for it. Although now it's not justifiable not to back up your facts, but still common. I feel like this is a cheap answer to your question. I don't know why he doesn't. It's not uncommon though. If he were an academic, my answer would be: he expects you to have a fair understanding of the historical background, and anything you didn't know you could go research it yourself.

The language of class struggle doesn't exist in America, but it's been in use by academics in Europe for decades. I'll keep an eye out as I continue reading to see if his intended goal is in fact to give us the language.

He paints Wilson as an ass, but not for entering WWI:

 > No other president in American history did more to damage the independence and freedom of the press, or set back the cause of social reform, than Wilson.

At least that was my interpretation of it. 

As for what he said about the academics at the time, I think you make a good point. I'll think about this a bit more.

The US invaded two countries, killed hundreds of thousands of people and destabilized the region, all based on false statements about WMD (that were known to be false at the time) which wasn't questioned by the media, which relates to Hedges' statements about how the media is owned by the elite and no longer act as the flag-bearers of classical liberalism. 

The US knew Al-Qaeda was behind the attacks. The Taliban [offered](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5) to hand over Bin Laden but the US refused. This is part of the same point that Hedges mentions in the book. Those who backed ""peace"" were demonized as those who wanted a ""German peace"". By ""peace"" I mean a peaceful settlement to WWI. Instead of at least trying to take the peaceful route, it was passed aside for a more militant route. As for whether the Taliban would have gone through with it is a different question, one worth discussing, but they didn't even try. My point is that there was a perfectly reasonable response here that didn't involve invading two countries and starting two wars.

And yes, my comments weren't to the point. I understood your statement of ""US needed to seek retribution"" to mean, specifically, via war. My bad.

cvqfqip,1,t3_3nkje4,kgwv,"I noticed some interesting connections to 1984.

During WWI the US tried to remove the German identity entirely:

> Sauerkraut became known as liberty cabbage,

> German clover appeared in the seed catalogues as crimson or liberty clover.

> Dachshunds were renamed liberty dogs.

In 1984, there was ""Liberty Gin"" and ""Liberty Coffee"" I think.

Also, the following quote reminds me of Newspeak. The language used by the inhabitants of Oceana.  Newspeak was aimed particularly at narrowing the spectrum of possible thought, and through ""the cultural embrace of simplification"" via clichés and slogans, we get just that.

cvqevvx,0,t1_cvoym4r,kgwv,"**Anyone have thoughts on Hedges’s obsession with language?**

I don't think it's an obsession. He's pointing out effects of propaganda and the methods of ""manufacturing consent"". People are given meaningless messages (""hope"", ""change"" come to mind) to repeat over and over, but they're vacuous. It keeps people from addressing the class struggles they're in. He's focused maybe a chapter or two on this subject, Chomsky's written many books on it. There is a lot to say. (Actually ""Manufacturing Consent"" was a phrase attributed to Walter Lippman, who was mentioned by Hedges in discussing the molding of public opinion).

**what do you think of modern terrorism laws, or any other laws, that mirror the communist laws Hedges talks about?**

The term ""terrorism"" has become quite meaningless. Let's take the official US definition (international terrorism, for instance), straight from the FBI's [homepage](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/terrorism/terrorism-definition):

> ""International terrorism"" means activities with the following three characteristics:

 > - Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
 > - Appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
 > - Occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.

How often has the US intimidated or coerced civilian populations? influenced policies of governments by intimidation and coercion? affected the conduct of government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping? Except for kidnapping, this is a rhetorical question. They do it all the time.

But the term ""terrorism"" only applies to our enemies, not to ourselves or our allies.

To reply succinctly: Terrorism laws are laws that give the state more power and control.

**Do you have any other examples, modern or historical, of this kind of Act, Bill, or what-have-you?**

Look into [COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO).

States will try to suppress those who dissent if they can. This is a bit of a truism. It's in there best interest to do so. In more democratic states, they are sidelined and labeled radicals, conspiracy theorists, or what have you, or perhaps, by legal means, silenced/jailed. In Totalitarian regimes, they'd just disappear, or get thrown into work camps, or sent to mental institutions. Those in power tend to want to maintain power.

I'd be interested in an alternate response to this question. Specifically more modern examples of similar laws.

**What do you think of the rise of propaganda Hedges talks about, and can you think of any examples, modern or otherwise?**

You say

 > And the condemnation of American involvement in WWI is a bit extreme. If he wants to criticize America’s involvement in the war, he should be giving a damn good reason to believe it wasn’t necessary to fight back Germany.

I don't see him condemning American involvement. I see him criticizing the states suppression of dissent and the narrowing of the spectrum of political debate. The entire chapter was about how far the US went in suppressing those who spoke out against the war. Not that the war was inherently wrong, just that it is against the tenants of classical liberalism to shut down rational debate and dissent if it disagrees with them. The propaganda system and the manufacturing of consent is highly manipulative. As he quotes the need of rhetoric by the ancient Greeks (Athenians) along side logic. Classical liberalism is supposed to rid us of the need for rhetoric and allow us to rely on reason and logic alone.

To respond to your question more directly, I'd recommend reading Lippmans book as well as Chomsky's ""Manufacturing Consent"". He'll give plenty of examples of how the propaganda system works in a democratic society.

cvqdvrw,0,t1_cvh4q8w,kgwv,"**Anyone else have an opinion on what his actual goal with the book is supposed to be?** 

The point of the book (so far, after having just read the first three chapters) appears to be to illustrate how classical liberalism has been degraded over the past few decades. So far, he's started talking about World War I, and the suppression of the ""radical left"", the rise of propaganda and public relations industry to a whole new level, the deterioration of labor movements, and the deterioration of the liberal class in general. He's giving examples backing up his claims that classical liberalism is dead. I don't think his point is to give us the ""language of class struggle"". It already exists: Marx, for starters or authors of the Enlightenment.

**Do you guys think this represents any real or significant change in the position of the Church, compared to how Hedges characterizes it?**

When Hedges talks about the institutional church, he's not just talking about Catholicism, he's talking about all the religion organizations in (specifically) the US. You're example of Pope Francis is just one small case, and so far, as you said, it's a ""pious non-statement"". The Catholic church had a similar [idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_theology) not too long ago: ""liberation theology"" (specifically in Latin America), well in this case, Capitalism pushed back (violently: death squads, disappearances, priests getting murdered, etc.), and the Catholic church lowered their tone. So until Francis pushes people to act and continues to do so, it's really just empty rhetoric. However, it's a start.

**do you think he's going too far with the anti-war sentiment?**

You said hes against war altogether. He doesn't appear to say that? For instance, WWI, he discusses how the US suppressed dissent (quite a bit) but he doesn't straight out say WWI wasn't necessary (although that would be a fair argument and worthy of discussion). His main point was that liberalism has been degraded because those who dissent and want to have a public discussion are silenced, which is against the tenants of classical liberalism.

You're saying it would be crazy for the US not to seek retribution for those who killed 3000 American citizens. Why? 

So, using the same reasoning:

 - It's justifiable for Palestine to kill hundreds of thousands of Israelis as revenge for Operation: Protective Edge which killed [1,560](https://www.byline.com/project/13/article/149) civilians?
 - Or for the Chilean people to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans as revenge for the first September 11: the US backed 1973 Chilean coup which resulted in about 3,200 [deaths](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/03/chil-m23.html) and years of harsh dictatorship.
 - How about the terrorist war the US ran against Nicaragua which resulted in tens of thousands of [deaths](http://www.democracynow.org/2004/6/8/reagan_was_the_butcher_of_my). Does this give Nicaragua the right to invade the US and kill hundreds of thousands of it's people?

What makes it okay for the US to do this, but not these other countries?

In any case, my argument here is that I don't think Hedges is entirely anti-war. He mentions somewhere he studied ""just war doctrine"" in seminary school. For instance, I don't think he would have had a problem with justifying entering WWII. I think he would have had a problem with the suppression of dissent. I think he would have advocated peaceful means: negotiation, compromise, etc. Perhaps I'm wrong, but from his tone, these seems to be a plausible conclusion.",2,0,1444157315,1444723225
cvqcgp7,0,t1_cv9kymw,kgwv,"This is a bit late, sorry. I wanted to comment on your Week 3 questions on his ""obsession with language"" as you say, but I needed to read your previous posts to understand where you first saw this.

You mention that ""boutique activism"" is popular and impotent, but I think the reason it is impotent is because they die off too quickly. What is needed is stronger groups of people that stay active indefinitely, or at least for much longer periods of time. Before this was done through strong unions and small communities, but these types of institutions have been slowly dismantled over the decades to the point where they have very little leverage. Churches still act as communities that bring people together, but as you say, they tend to by illiberal and focus. The right and left have a lot in common if you describe the challenges they face in the language of class struggle, but the language can't be spoken, immediately it's sidelined. So the right and left focus on other issues that don't address their institutional problems: abortion, gay marriage, immigration, etc. (not that these aren't important issues), they just polarize on issues that they disagree with and don't work together on their mutual class struggle.

Also, about what you're saying about citations, I agree. There is a small part in Julian Assange's ""When Google Met Wikileaks"" when he discusses how it's absurd that journalists and authors don't cite every single statement they say, now that we have online newspapers where it doesn't take up space and doesn't interfere with the writing. This way, anyone can view the sources, perhaps determine the bias of the sources for themselves, confirm the arguments are sound, etc.",1,0,1444155264,1444723225
