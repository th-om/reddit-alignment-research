If Magical Girl Valhalla doesn't have cheese, there's probably a whole lot of other ""Earthly Pleasures"" it doesn't have.

Maybe that was okay for Madoka, but someone as selfish as Homura would never have been happy with that.",1,0,1444597940,1444717948

cvhcaaj,0,t1_cvh7r2g,Xirema,"It's the broader definition of racism. Just about any other definition you find will be a subset of that definition.

Republicans get accused of Racism because of the perception that their policies do more to strengthen and maintain Racist systems than they do to dismantle those systems. Now you can argue in circles whether this perception is justified or not, but the fact that the Republican congressional party is 95% white strengthens that accusation, because it shows that non-white individuals are often reluctant to represent the Republican party. Again, argue all you like about the 'whys' and 'hows', but if the Republican party remains less diverse than the Democrats (and far less diverse than the rest of the country), there's no argument in the world that will plausibly make the case that Republicans are non-racist.

cvhbtec,0,t1_cvh9std,Xirema,"Actually, the Democratic party is about 66% white, which is very close to the 63% whiteness of the country as a whole. There's still lots of imbalance (some minoritized groups are better represented, proportionately speaking, than others) and the fact that the number skews white is still a problem, but trying to paint the relative diversity of the Democrat party as being evidence of racial discrimination against white people is laughably wrong.",2,0,1443474169,1444717948
cvhbk8y,0,t1_cvh8pey,Xirema,No it doesn't. It only assumes that a non-racist representation would be one where the representatives in office are racially distributed in a way that roughly approximates the racial distribution of the country. ,2,0,1443473790,1444717948
cvh7fsd,0,t1_cvh6sid,Xirema,"Racism is defined as a system by which one (or more) races have disproportionate power over another (or more). So a system in which white americans are overrepresented and nonwhite americans are underrepresented would, by definition, be racist.

Now, to be clear, Democrats in office don't represent some potential ""sans-racist utopia""; far from it. But Republicans are doing an astonishingly worse job at bringing in non white representatives. There may very well be many complicated, difficult to trace reasons why this is, but at the end of the day, the fact that the Republican party is overwhelmingly white (compared to democrats, and *especially* compared to the country as a whole) is a strong indicator that the party has a problem with race and racism.",-3,0,1443468000,1444717948
