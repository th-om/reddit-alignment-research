It says nothing about striking those laws down (except as applied in a given case) or about altering federal laws.

cuvbz11,1,t3_3k6avz,Corranus,"First, the Constitution does not give the power of Judicial Review to the Supreme Court. The Court decided that it had that power and no one argued with them too much. Personally, I think judicial review is a stupid way to decide the Constitutionality of laws. It's made the process of selecting justices far too political and completely overhauled the system of checks and balances, leaving impeachment as the only check on the Court and no power outside the reach of the Court.

What's more, the 14th Amendment says that Congress is the one who has the power to enforce it, by legislation. The Supreme Court is acting unconstitutionally by enforcing the amendment in a way not authorized by Congress. Indeed, they're enforcing it in a way that Congress forbade.

If that's not enough, Kennedy's interpretation was a flagrant violation of the rule of law, saying:

>""The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a character protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.""

In effect ""the authors of the amendment left a bunch of room for interpretation so that we could make up additional rules."" Had the 14th amendment said in a parenthetical ""this includes same-sex marriage"" there is no way on earth it would have passed, even just 10 years ago. The Constitution does not change quickly for a reason. Even Roberts, who plainly wanted same-sex marriage to be legalized, argued that Kennedy was betraying his own principles along with the Constitution, quoting Kennedy himself:

>“One can conclude that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society. It does not follow that each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system.”

TL;DR: You are placing the Supreme Court on a pedestal that the Constitution does not give it, the Founding Fathers did not want for it and its actions prove it has not earned.",4,0,1441778022,1444731394

""Honor among thieves"" is based off an arbitrary code of ethics, normally put in place so people will feel better about their own actions, which they know to be wrong.
