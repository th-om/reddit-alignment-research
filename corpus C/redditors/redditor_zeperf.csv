cvxczes,0,t1_cvxbj4v,zeperf,"I think its irrelevant.  See OPs Adam Smith quote:

>By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.

A slave can't pursue his own interests and leave.  OP's point doesn't rely on the good will of employers.

OP's argument relies on things become cheaper rather than wages increasing.  So you point to amazon mechanical turk (which I've never heard of) as people busting their ass for not much.  But if everyone is busting their ass, why would we do it only to give away all our profit to Amazon, Walmart, etc.  The exploitation only comes from monopoly which isn't addressed in the post.

In a healthy free market, regardless of wage regulation, prices come down.  As water, food, and transportation has over the last 200 years and as communication/internet/education, entertainment, and furniture has in the last 20 years.",1,1,1444683669,1444721919
cvxbq80,1,t3_3ofp9r,zeperf,"Do you have more welfare instead?  I think its important for you to specify.  I can agree with you that in the long term, you may see prices drop which is equivalent to having wages increase.  But I think prices also drop when many people can afford the product (tvs, cell phones, internet, food, etc).

So are you suggesting that wages are supplemented with welfare, or that we become comfortable with poorer (and maybe harder-working) people?  If wages are supplemented, are you essentially advocating that the minimum wage should come from taxpayers equally rather than employers directly?",1,1,1444681919,1444721919

cvswrez,1,t3_3o0hic,zeperf,"/r/politics will push it as something inethical because the companies aren't ""giving back"" (as if selling the original original product was them taking from you), but I think its really a logistical problem.

The US wants lots of economic activity within its borders.  Companies can't easily reinvest their profits and get a return greater than the US tax rate so they park it somewhere else.  So when companies would rather take their money and run, its worth considering a way to either ban that or lower taxes.",3,0,1444336512,1444721919

So just imagine being the other person. If someone says they were in the army, you might not know anything about that, and most people will just ask the simplest questions that come to mind - ""How long? Where?"" but not actually be interested in it.  You will get a much more interesting conversation if you ask them about the emotions they experienced.  ""What were the best/worse parts?""  ""How was boot camp?"".  This will also lead to more openings for conversation and you will get to know them quickly.  Of course you got to be respectful.

And its fun to get a sense of all the places and neighborhoods and see some of the same people around town.  The parks are nice, the art scene is good, and bike trails are everywhere.  And of course the whole town goes nuts during football which is fun.  People are also extremely friendly here. ",5,0,1444276473,1444721919
