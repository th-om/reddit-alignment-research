cvtgi9y,0,t1_cvtgdu5,MysteryGuestFighter,"And I will reply simply.   People indeed are rational and self interested, but interactions and the social aspect of people is not something rational nor purely in self interest.  People react in different ways to different people for entirely different reasons.  Social interaction is one of the most dynamic things in the entire world.  Cultures can be entirely different from one another.  Some in areas and conditions that are near mirror images of each other.  Economics is based of of the social aspect of the human, not the individual.  You can not link the aspects of the individual only, that may be a reason for why we have so many sociopaths in top positions in the economy.  ",1,0,1444372864,1444727340
cvtg8zq,0,t1_cvtg53s,MysteryGuestFighter,"Yet physics themselves don't change with changes in the field of physics.  The theory in no way shapes the reality of physics.   The theories being tried in economics and people adapting to these new applied theories definitely changes economics.  Economics is held to a higher standard because of the impact it can have on society.  You could destroy a civilization with a badly applied theory in economics if it becomes enforced.  The past 50 years has shown us that.  The theories that were wrong with physics?  No changes in what is happening, just our scope of understanding.",2,0,1444372020,1444727340
cvtfzk4,0,t1_cvtfsm8,MysteryGuestFighter,"Now you are being disingenuous.  If you know anything about the last 50 years, you will know how much economics has changed from the influence of popular economists.  Economics is constantly adapting to new observations, be it through new practices by businesses or policies and laws being passed.   Every change and observation tilts the table in a new way.   As an example, artificial scarcity has forever muddled supply and demand based economics, but people still hold fast to these views saying they haven't changed in any way.",2,0,1444371199,1444727340
cvtf959,0,t1_cvtd7me,MysteryGuestFighter,"The logic is this:
Both are observational and try to explain what they are observing.  

The difference between the two is one directly affects what it is observing, while the other is constant.  
Thus a master observer of one would be just as useful at observing and commenting on the other.


Edit: Modern Economics literally fits the definition of dogma.  While economics as a whole was not originally accepted unquestionably, you can't have a dialogue with the great majority anymore.  This main comment thread is proof of the shift towards dogma.  Anyone who is questioning any part of capitalism gets ""COMMUNISM DIDN'T WORK""  thrown at them.  You can not be taken seriously unless you are a member of one of the existing groups of economics.

Dogma: a belief or set of beliefs that is accepted by the members of a group without being questioned or doubted

I'll admit my first comment isn't too clear, it needs an edit.",3,0,1444369031,1444727340

If you change what people valued tomorrow, current models and the economies behind them would fall apart.  If we change the theories we have behind gravity or any of the factors regarding it, gravity still exists tomorrow.  

edit:  While both are observational, only one is a practice in searching for an ultimate answer.  The other is trying to find an answer in something that is constantly shifting.  A lot of educated guesses have to go into both, but someone whose field is better suited for looking for an ultimate answer might have a better guess at final probabilities.   A person whose field is more set to a dynamically changing thing would be a better observer of only the short term.  /edit

cv5k8dx,0,t1_cv5g4gm,MysteryGuestFighter,"And what are you basing the value of labor on?  Profits are at an all time high.  Wages have regressed.  Productivity is extremely high when compared to other places in the world.  But you think the cost of labor should be lower.  I seriously want to know what you base the value of labor on.  Other countries?  Are you one of the people who support lower wages because people will work for less in another country?  It's a different environment and cost of living in every country.  That is the true measure of what a wage should be.  Wages should match cost of living, and in the united states our wages fail to match the cost of living.  The GDP has nearly doubled while wages are still flat, there is something seriously wrong about that.  ",2,0,1442551828,1444727340
