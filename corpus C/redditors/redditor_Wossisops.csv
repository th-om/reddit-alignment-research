cvxlp2f,1,t3_3oidlf,Wossisops,"Basic bnb's start differently but end the same. For example:
2,1,D4,DB2D,B2,DB2U,B2,DB2 for 29 percent.

Or you could do f1,2,db2d, "" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""

Another is b3,2 db2d, "" "" "" "" ""

...you get the idea. 


It is extremely important for you, and anyone else that struggles with tremor's inputs to learn the trick to executing them. I'll use the first combo I listed as an example. Input the 2,1,db4,db2 quickly, like you would any other combo. DO NOT try to immediately input the up button. Instead, wait maybe half a second after inputing the db2 to press the up/down button. His db2u/db2d is a deterrent to new tremor players because it feels so clunky. However I can assure you that if you take your time inputting the u/d that you will execute your desired input 99 percent of the time. 



As for variations, I see a lot of people commenting here saying that aftershock is the best. While this may be true for DJT it will likely be untrue for you. I would attribute that claim to the difficulty of knowing when to set up your dd1. You will find much more luck with crystalline or metallic. Crystalline offers some nice armor, and metallic offers the best zoning for tremor as well as a standing reset (in gold and lava form respectively.)

I'm happy to help you by answering any questions you would have. If you want to spar I am more than happy to help if you're on ps4.

P.S. Seriously, aftershock is by no means ""far and away the best variation."" Tremor's variations are all phe-fucking-nomenal. That being said, I think metallic is the best because the standing reset coupled with tremor's insane corner carry and mixups are insane. Plus switching to gold form gives you an amazing db1 that only furthers tremor's great zone game. ",2,0,1444697422,1444717131

cvmctgw,0,t1_cvmayjt,Wossisops,"U/mumbobumbo is correct. It's not a name recognition thing. I think he will get a very slight boost at the first debate in a few weeks and while Hillary loses a point or two. After that Biden will announce he's not running, and Clinton will get his share of the points. People will realize Bernie is too far behind and give up. And while those groups may be formed by republicans, the most active members of the electorate (that's to say those who try to gain favor for their desired candidate) make up a tiny portion of the voting population. Sanders is just a few years ahead of his time for American politics. ",-1,0,1443835926,1444717131
cvmcooa,0,t1_cvmc2vr,Wossisops,The minority portion of that statement still blows my mind. Sanders has been an active part of diminishing white privilege and assisting ethnic minorities for decades. I can't see Hillary investing that much time in the issue. ,4,0,1443835638,1444717131
cvma4is,0,t1_cvm7ykq,Wossisops,Agreed. But it's definitely a portion of that 20 percent. Biden and Hillary are very similar candidates. Not to mention the majority of democrats (and republicans) are comfortable with the type of candidates they've had for the last twenty years. It's the same reason Paul won't get the republican nomination. Still pulling for Sanders though. ,2,0,1443830274,1444717131
