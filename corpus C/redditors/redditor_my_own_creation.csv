If you are spending near half a trillion more than you take in every single year, it can't be considered healthy.  We are already spending 6% of our yearly budget just to pay the interest.  The dollars spent on debt service will go up exponentially if the annual budget can't be balanced.

Most companies like Gap, Nike, and Wal-Mart have learned that news programs full of children making shoes is bad for business.  Western consumers don't have the stomach for it.

So they have put in Global Compliance and Social Compliance programs to insure that the kids parents and older siblings are the ones getting the jobs.
