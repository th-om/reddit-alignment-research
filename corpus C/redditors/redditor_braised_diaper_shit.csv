cvxrub6,0,t1_cvxiea8,braised_diaper_shit,You could literally break all sci-fi movies down into another genre if you really wanted. This argument is tiring. Alien and Star Wars are both sci-fi.,10,0,1444707110,1444722034

cvx67f1,0,t1_cvv1cdk,braised_diaper_shit,That doesn't make sense. Depth doesn't have to be a hindrance. Is Battlefield really too hard to grasp? Just because a game has more depth doesn't mean you have to use it all.,1,0,1444674012,1444722034
