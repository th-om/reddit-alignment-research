cvwp762,0,t1_cvvo7e6,Question_Zeitgeist,"Europeans have started to take things for granted, and do not realize how precious and precarious their liberal democracies and high standards of living are. This mass wave of migrants spells trouble for the future. Europe needs to stop being as paranoid as it is about not appearing 'racist' or 'xenophobic'. Look at these statistics: https://migrationtrends.wordpress.com",1,0,1444632544,1444720751
cvmdvkx,0,t1_cvm80gj,Question_Zeitgeist,"That might be true. But people make this form of argument on other fronts -- e.g. the US is alone among developed nations to have lax gun regulations, the US is unique in not granting free healthcare, etc.  These arguments stand and fall together...",1,0,1443838237,1444720751
cvlunta,0,t1_cvlk7lf,Question_Zeitgeist,"Having a lot of young people *by itself* is not what makes countries have good economies. The places with the most number of young people are: Niger, Mali, Congo. They're not exactly booming economies or great places to live...",0,0,1443804942,1444720751
cvldt6y,0,t1_cvldorp,Question_Zeitgeist,"Sure. The sizes of their economies are reasonably large. That's why they are in the G20. But membership in the G20 is not enough to be classified as 'developed'. Developed countries are ones who have high levels of HDI, GDP per capita, etc. etc. India and Indonesia are in the G20 -- but surely these are poor countries, and few people want to immigrate to them.",-3,0,1443760086,1444720751
cvldowg,0,t1_cvldfaz,Question_Zeitgeist,"Well, imagine someone who has no ties to the US except they were born here. Why should they receive the full benefits of citizenship?

Secondly, having birthright citizenship seems to create a further incentive for illegal immigration -- because once you have kids in the US, they will be set, and you might eventually get citizenship based on their status as citizens.",0,0,1443759820,1444720751
cvldmia,0,t1_cvldixo,Question_Zeitgeist,"Well, they are usually classified as 'developing'... but that's a verbal dispute. Maybe instead of 'developed' I can say 'advanced economies'..",1,0,1443759673,1444720751
cvjxgmx,1,t3_3my73b,Question_Zeitgeist,"Good on Germany for doing this. But judging from past evidence, there is reason to be pessimistic: https://migrationtrends.wordpress.com",2,0,1443657257,1444720751
cvfkvet,0,t1_cvfkdg7,Question_Zeitgeist,"Hmm.. well the extent to which a particular set of beliefs is a factor could be determined by isolating other factors -- colonial history, gdp, etc. etc. But it seems we find that in majority Muslim countries of varying levels of gdp (for example) -- Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar on one end and Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia on the other end -- you still find very repressive/intolerant cultures. Further, other countries with colonial histories -- South Korea, Hong Kong, India, Mexico -- do not exhibit these patters (at least not to that extent)...",2,0,1443335165,1444720751
