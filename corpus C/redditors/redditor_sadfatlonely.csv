However, if you want to compete for championships every year I don't think he's the man to do it. I realize that it'd be difficult to tear that band-aid off, but it may have to be done.",2,0,1444700418,1444718840

cvx3pgv,0,t1_cvwxueo,sadfatlonely,"Ecactly, Bielema puts his arm between the ref and the Bama player, and tries to push the Bama player back, before he fakes being shoved. Even if Robinson had shoved Bielema it wouldn't have been much different than what Bielema was actively doing. In fact, the move that Robinson makes, that causes the official to believe Bielema's acting, is lifting his arm to get Bielema's hand off of him.
