cvxq065,0,t1_cvx76yi,Yosarian2,"Well, it can demonstrate some simple rat brain behaviors, although people have been able to do that with much smaller and more simplified models before.

They open sourced all the software code, so anyone (with a supercomputer) can run it.   People are apparently already using it to run experiments and try to answer questions about rat brains.   In a few years we may have a better idea how useful this is going to end up being.",2,0,1444704060,1444718370
cvxpk63,0,t1_cvufzh9,Yosarian2,"Eh.  IMHO, both expanding into the inner solar system and fixing things like poverty on Earth are much better uses of resources then 90% of the stuff they do, and we should be doing both much more rapidly.

In the long term, expanding into the solar system (colonizing Mars/ colonizing the Moon/ mining asteroids/ space stations/ ect) is going to dramatically improve the amount of resources, energy, and space available to the human race, and that is going to make it easier for us to solve all of our other problems.  (And vice versa; like you say, dealing with poverty and helping the third world advance is going to increase the rate of scientific progress, which will help us get to Mars; all of these things create positive feedback loops and help each other).  It's a very long term investment, but I think it's going to be a really good one.

I mean, people don't think about it, but Mars is a whole planet.   Expanding on to Mars is basically a multiplier that makes all the other advances we make that much more effective.",1,0,1444703359,1444718370
cvx5aw4,0,t1_cvv1305,Yosarian2,"It's narrow AI.   Most big data analytic type of stuff is generally considered narrow AI, and is studied in the field of artificial intelligence.

It certanly isn't general AI, if that's what you're asking.  ",2,0,1444672707,1444718370
cvwykwr,0,t1_cvw3xwk,Yosarian2,"There have been a number of historical cases where a doctor who discovered something went on to experiment on himself with it.  It's dangerous as hell, but it's legal to do that, and if it does go well the data you can can help you bring it to other patients much faster.",1,0,1444662255,1444718370
cvw5ggo,0,t1_cvvy69f,Yosarian2,"The US priority is getting rid of ISIS. There's a reason the US is bombing ISIS and not Assad forces.

However, the US can't and won't support Assad in the process.   If they tried the whole anti-ISIS coalition would collapse since most of the countries in the coalition really hate Assad, and for good reason.  (Saudi Arabia, Turkey, ect.)

I think that if people in Syria really feel like they have to choose between Assad and ISIS, most will choose ISIS.  They may hate ISIS but they now hate Assad even more.  Supporting the anti-ISIS rebel groups may be the only way to stop ISIS from taking over the whole country, especally since I think we're at a point where a fall of Assad is now inevitable, no matter what Russia or Iran do to delay it.",1,0,1444594557,1444718370
cvw5184,0,t1_cvvv924,Yosarian2,"Everyone is going to make a mistake sometimes and say the wrong thing, or say something they don't mean, and that's fine.   I don't care about that.

But I think this is the other kind of ""gaffe"", the kind where a politician says what he really thinks and then has to take it back later.   Those are worth paying attention to because they tell you what they'll actually want to do in office.

Anyway even his ""clarification"" wasn't much better.  It's still clear he has a very low opinion of Mudlims, and thinks that very few of them would be able to hold elected office and follow the Constitution.",1,0,1444593932,1444718370
cvvv0yx,0,t1_cvvrlk5,Yosarian2,"Again if you listen to what he initially said it doesn't need clarifying.   He clearly shifted his position in response to the criticism.

Also quoting a political stance being taken by a politican and then disagreeing is not a personal attack.",4,0,1444577617,1444718370
cvvumgd,0,t1_cvvssh8,Yosarian2,"Yeah, but in the US most religious conservatves are ideologically very pro-capatilist and anti-socilist.  I don't think changing the party system would change that.",2,0,1444576791,1444718370
cvvucy2,0,t1_cvvtmoa,Yosarian2,"It is a feature in every multiparty democracy i know of.  Multiple parties can form a coalition to create a majority, but if the coalition breaks up the goverment dissolves and either they need to form a new coalition, or sometimes they have new elections.

You are right that moderate republicans could try to form a coaliion with moderate dems, but that's an option in our system as well; if all else fails moderate republicans may need some democrat votes to elect a new house leader if the tea party won't cooperate.",3,0,1444576275,1444718370
cvvsje5,0,t1_cvvr7lw,Yosarian2,"Eh.  It's quite likely that the social consevatives snd the economic conservatives would still form a coalition goverment together.   You see that a lot in counties with multiparty systems, and in the US there's a huge overlap between the two groups anyway.",2,0,1444572142,1444718370
