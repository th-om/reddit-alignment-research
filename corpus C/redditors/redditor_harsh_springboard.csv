I like this sub because it is a place where fundamental assumptions ARE challenged. I would encourage you to at least attempt to view the situation from an alternative viewpoint, rather than rejecting it outright.",1,0,1443877747,1444720336

cv5ras7,0,t1_cv5nfg7,harsh_springboard,"This is an interesting topic. Perhaps I'm misrepresenting myself. My essential point is this: there are cases when an engineer or executive would knowingly and legally produce a product that could be expected to hurt someone through malfunction at least once. This happens every day, in many different industries, and is a statistical inevitability. This is particularly true in the automotive industry. 

These decisions expose the organization to a civil suit (and as you said, American Tort law would provide guidelines on that liability). There is nothing about this case, however, that indicates criminal negligence. Which was my original point. ",1,0,1442577888,1444720336
