I think I'm missing something here because I don't live in the states. Is there some document that I can read where this is confirmed (a search can be as little as running someone's name in a database)? ",-2,0,1444704296,1444731902
cvxps3q,0,t1_cvxofoy,chucksimpson,"We don't know if the police searched his car or his person. From the article, it seems that they didn't search him, but all they did was simply ask him questions and then ask his wife questions, to see if the stories match up? Unless, there's another source out there with more information. I'm just going by the article.

cvxk27v,0,t1_cvxhnmu,chucksimpson,"Let's not exaggerate here. Where is the police harassment? All they did was respond to a call regarding a suspicious man on a school grounds (which considering all the hype around school shootings doesn't seem so unexpected), ask the man what happened and then corroborated what he said by visiting his wife's place of work. No one was arrested or ""brought in"". 

>She said the man was on his way out of town by 8 a.m. and the code yellow lifted about 9 a.m.

The entire situation was resolved within an hour and a half. In fact, the police seem to have handled everything appropriately here, from what has been reported in this article.

He was implying that we don't refer to subjects in the plural like we do for maths and that if we did it would sound weird and ""wrong"", so I provided examples to counter his point. I don't understand what you're trying to prove by providing examples of subjects that are in the singular form. I never said that either form is correct, just that subjects can exist in both the singular and plural form without sounding ""wrong"". ",1,0,1444673431,1444731902
