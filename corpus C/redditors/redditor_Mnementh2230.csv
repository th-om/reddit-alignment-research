First frame:  closeup of a girl's face, really just nose and mouth.  Lips are parted, tongue running along upper teeth.

Second frame:  side shot closeup of feet, in sandals, crossed at the ankles.  Top foot's toes are stretched, bottom foot's toes are curled.

Third frame:  closeup of a hand, closed in to a fist around some sort of cylinder.  The bottom of the frame cuts off the bottom of the hand so you can't see the ""action"", but motion lines show that the hand is on a down-stroke.

Fourth frame.  Top down view of the same hand, pulling away from a piece of paper with lots of squiggly lines on it denoting writing.  In big, bold, red letters you see what the ""implement"" from the previous frame left - a stamp of ""REJECTED"" across the top of the paper.

Fifth, final frame:  The whole woman, sitting in her chair at her desk, hair slightly askew, cheeks slightly flushed, and a very satisfied grin on her face.
