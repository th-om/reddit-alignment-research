most people like you arent serial killers, at least not of humans. (vegan rant omitted)

where to meet guys? online, you know, okcupid hotordont adam4adam all that. offline, in classes, clubs, friend of a friend, etc. fetlife for meeting guys into your thing. what's your thing? there's probably a subreddit for it. put your stories online, anonympously. they might find a fan base, they might not.",1,0,1444692242,1444724684
cvxhl6n,0,t1_cvxawv6,arbivark,"well for example today i called in and confirmed that i'll be spending the next 4 weekends in st louis for $3k. before that it was lincoln nebraska, before that cincinnati. there's nothing local, so lots of travel, all deductible expenses. got to be in excellent health, no cigs, no drugs no meds. 18-45 preferably. I charge 15% of what you'll make in your first 3 years if you'd like me to be your study broker. You could expect to make $10K/yr as a part time now and then thing or up to $20K/yr (gross) if full time. In between studies a person could work as a temp or drive a cab or do online stuff etc. So it doesn't beat a decent regular job, but it beats, say, just working at McDonalds.
I do it to free up time for my law practice/reddit addiction.
