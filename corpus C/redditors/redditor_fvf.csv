cvpc7im,0,t1_cvpbuy1,fvf,"Again, I must thank you for providing evidence that what is ostensibly pure evil is usually just an utter lack of capacity for any trace of coherent thinking (although I suspect in this case more severely so than usual). So you provide me with some modicum of hope for humanity. Thanks!",1,0,1444078654,1444728424

cvpah9q,0,t1_cvp90do,fvf,It is quite embarrassing indeed that I was unable to follow my initial instinct and let the filth drift by without notice. I'll manage though.,1,0,1444076135,1444728424
cvp8kff,0,t1_cvoyxv1,fvf,"> So I ask again, what dehumanization has taken place?

The answer to that question is so painfully obvious that any answer would be quite meaningless except perhaps as some psychotherapeutical device. But you'll have to get that elsewhere, I'm afraid.",1,0,1444073318,1444728424
cvp8g05,0,t1_cvp3gg9,fvf,"I don't know at all if that is what caused the failure (in fact that's pretty much what I'm asking about). But now that I more or less accidentally discovered the discrepancy, I'm a bit reluctant to put the ""wrong"" alternator back in.

Here's the failure: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6817788/IMG_20150924_160748.jpg

That's the lower engine mount that broke (aluminum I suppose), and the back side of the drive belt tensioner.",1,0,1444073136,1444728424
cvoyttt,0,t1_cvoyb3k,fvf,"In the face of such nasty dehumanization of others based on utterly flawed logic, I think my ""vitriol"" is rather meek but perfectly warranted.",1,0,1444058107,1444728424
cvoodro,0,t1_cvo1tiz,fvf,"Your reading comprehension is severely lacking. (I know you won't understand this, so in more plain words: It's dysfunctional, you are clearly unable to gather any reasonable information from plain text). I'm sorry I was tricked into continuing this thread after all, because as I first expected this was clearly entirely futile and useless.

At least I have some more evidence for my theory that most people that spout vile and dehumanizing vitriol are really just plain stupid beyond words.",1,0,1444025345,1444728424

cvo1mle,0,t1_cvo1c47,fvf,"Jesus christ you really *are* this stupid aren't you. I never claimed religions are all the same, nothing near it. ""Xenophobic""? You should look up fancy words before you use them, because this makes zero sense.

I think it's wrong to randomly murder other people. Do you need me to explain why I think that is too, rather than I act like it's obvious because I believe it?",-1,0,1443984841,1444728424
