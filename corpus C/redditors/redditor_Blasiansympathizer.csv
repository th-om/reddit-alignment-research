His son, who had have both his legs amputated because he got caught wearing the wrong color- he wasn't in A gang, he was a star athlete in at my high school in fact, doesn't care that black on black violence is a reality? WTF can they do? When you social economic bull shit that kept their families in the mud is keeping their kids in the mud. And the kids see that, but they feel nobody gives a shit about a ""thug"". Oh wait, other thugs decide to band together and let loose all their negative emotions out on the surrounding neighborhoods. You say we don't give a shit but the truth is its the rest of Americans like you who look down on us that don't give a shit. THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD START GIVING A SHIT.

Just a few this wonderful WHITE lady pointed out. And i hope you don't mind me calling out her race. Only did it so nobody can say she doesn't have the ability to sympathize and the privilege concept was pointed out by none other than, an understanding participant in said privilege.

I also never said success was a privilege  of being white, dum dum. Stop putting words in my mouth.

cv80nyc,0,t1_cv7yss9,Blasiansympathizer,">Blacks are a group when it's police, or <any other group> ""against"" blacks, but blacks are not ""a monolith"" when many blacks are acting in a similar manner towards any other group, including their own? What kind of messed up, one-way, hypocritical logic is that?

So because we choose to focus on those who continue to kill black people and are able to get away without punishment (The Police) and not the ""black on black violence"" where individuals are actually answering to the law. Check out some prison statistics and tell me how many black people are there for answering for their crimes vs white cops who can beat a man down in the streets ( Yup bringing up that Rodney King shit because that level of BRUTALITY existed 20 years ago). At least on Black on Black crime, we still got the law to answer to, but what about the people who are elected to protect us? Who protects us from them? The Feds? Cuz they're track record on aiding the African-American community is full of positivity/s. 

>The fact is what it is - blacks are killing other blacks at a disproportionate rate of any other group on group....

Ok, do you understand why? or should I explain it to you? Genuine question.

>If the movement wanted to call themselves something like ""Blacks against Police Violence"" or something like that - that's a more accurate representation of the movement. By and large, the movement does not address black on black violence - which is how many young black men meet their unfortunate demise.

First of all, ""DEMISE"", what are you, a Bond villain? Secondly, if all this beef is because of the name, I'm going to have to stop responding because I would be then wasting my time on trying to explain the reality of the situation to people who seem to only read the covers of books. 

>What is the BLM movement (the topic at hand) doing to effectively improve this condition? 

If you don't consider advocating for a law enforcement system that doesn't brutalize black people (and believe me when i say that part of the aggression that is built in to these black on black crimes is in part to the relationship between black communities and law enforcement , it's not the sole factor, but it is a considerable variable) a way of attempting to improve it, than you aren't looking at a full picture, rather focusing on a single part of the puzzle.

>Let's also not ignore the fact that many police altercations that blacks have are the direct result of responding to black on black crime. 

Lmao dude your pretty dense. That's what a community is, especially lower income communities. They are usually made up of individuals who are of similar economic status and similar culture. Everybody's culture likes to keep close to their own, whether out of habit our because you just grew up there. Literally, this should be ignored. Because black communities are made up of, oh wait, black people, what surprise me oh my/s

>This is not in any way directly attributable to BLM. Police body cameras have been a thing long before BLM, and only continue to grow in popularity as *many* groups call for body cameras on police - and as departments learn that body cameras are a great way to mitigate risk, more departments will be rolling them out.

Obviously it's not a direct fucking link you dumb dumb. I never said it was directly because of BLM. BUT BLM did play a fucking part as you have obviously stated when you for some reason put quotes around groups. Sorry for the cussing and name calling but this little section just rubbed me the wrong way. It's so obiously contradicting and trying to portray as if the statement LAPD officers are getting body cams because of the DIRECT involvement of BLM advocates, when i didn't. I hate when niggas try to put words in my mouth. My apologies. I will also accept your apology ahead time.

>Let's hear some practical solutions to the issues at hand - not just divisive comments. This is exactly why the BLM movement is continuing to lose legitimacy as people see that there's not a whole lot of substance coming out. 

WTF dude, do i look like Jesus? This statement right here is bullshit by trying to make iit look like I should have all the answers. Obviously I didn't or else I wouldn't be speaking to you. That's how life works, people get fed up with the way things are, they advocate change. They don't know 100% how to achieve right of the bat, but they know that piece by piece justice will continue to be fought for. and It's only losing legitimacy because some people (like the Bernie Sanders Brigade) are doing dumb shit like attacking allies just because his position as a politician. Get out of here, with that ""Oh you don't have any solutions to the problem? then there's not that big of a problem"" bullshit please and thank you.

>TBH, I think the solution to these issues lies within both the police community and the black communities, and both groups need to at least see things from the other's prospective to come to a solution. Police body cameras and some policy changes will help with the micro, but change has to come from from *both* sides to help at a macro level. 

Is this suppose to be your helpful solution to the problem? a vague as ""everybody needs to change"" bs. C'mon dude, this is already something I assumed everybody believed, that changes need to be made. But if you ask me who I'm more worried about being hurt by, it 's by the police because they could not only do it, but keep doing it without punishment as time and time again has proven. At least of a nigga runs up on me, I'm 100% sure the law won't help him get out of facing punishment (as you can see by the thousands of black prisoners we got packed into pens across the country. 
At the end of the day, all I want is to feel safe around police officers...like white people do.

cv7y4lh,0,t1_cv7xdow,Blasiansympathizer,"You live in an illusion dude. You believe that everybody should be treated equal- beautiful, fantastic, you should be applauded for such vision. BUT the reality is different. Because of how the black community was introduced/forced into the country by people like your great great grandfather and his grandfathers (assuming your white) we aren't living in a system (government, education, societal contexts, etc) that treats everyone equal. In fact, to an extent, it still favors the white majority (look at the demographic of Congress for ex). So think of it from my pov (Black/Asian student). You're sitting there, enjoying the extras in life I unfortunately don't, talking people like me that we all should just be treated equal at the snap of a finger. Do you understand the concept a little better? ",3,0,1442764260,1444726416
