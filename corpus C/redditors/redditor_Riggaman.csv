cuwm5pn,0,t1_cuwhthn,Riggaman,"Regarding women controlling how frequently they go to the doctor: this is a common issue in health care economics. While there is an element of moral hazard when it comes to utilizing health services, from a cost standpoint this is more associated with unnecessary tests, treatments, prescriptions, and worst of all, receiving non-emergent care in an emergency setting. That said, the type of care that women require, should it be underutilized, would lead to higher expenses overall. 

For example, if a woman decides to skip regular gynecologist visits, she could be at risk for developing any number of uniquely female conditions that are much more expensive to treat as they progress. Generally speaking, this is what happens to men too when they neglect preventive care. The difference is *when* these long-term problems manifest. Women are more likely to develop long-term issues stemming from lack of care earlier in life, which means they are covered by private insurance instead of Medicare. In addition, these problems can have other uniquely female consequences (e.g., an infection that goes untreated could lead to fertility problems, which cost more to treat than the infection itself).

cuwm0g8,0,t1_cuwhthn,Riggaman,"See my other response in this thread about underwriting. The point is that men are more likely to have accidents, so it makes more sense to charge them more - because they can. It matters less WHY men are more likely to get in accidents than it does that they do get in more accidents and are therefore charged more. 

Placing restrictions of this kind is relatively new, and has started with health insurance. What I'm seeing from folks here is not so much arguments against the new laws as they apply to health insurance, but more against allowing gender rating in other types of insurance.

cuwe3p5,0,t1_cuwdcw3,Riggaman,"Ah but you see that's the problem with underwriting. It's not feasible (or maybe ethical) to do the kind of digging that would tell companies any particular person's ACTUAL risk of getting into an accident (things like mental health, drinking habits, etc.), so they have to use underwriting, which is like stereotyping for actuaries. They play it safe by charging everybody with a particular characteristic a little bit more, because to charge a few actually risky people a lot more would be logistically impossible. 

And, for what it's worth, they do take into account the driving record when scoring you. 

The key here isn't the risk argument though. They KNOW women are more expensive to cover for health, and that men are more expensive than women for cars. The thing is, congress determined they can't charge women more. Trust me, they would if they could - and did! Prior to 2010, the majority of female nonsmokers were charged more for health insurance than male smokers. 

The only thing stopping them from doing that now is the law. A similar law could be passed to protect male drivers.",8,0,1441855111,1444731044
cuwdvwk,0,t1_cuwdapn,Riggaman,"I don't think so. A quick google search shows me that Florida has outlawed underwriting race. If Florida has done it, I'd be willing to bet that these laws are pretty common. 

The other clue is that there is some controversy about using credit scores and marital status to determine ratings. The argument is that these are used as proxies for race. Not sure I buy that, but if there is that sort of mental gymnastics going on, I wouldn't be surprised if it's illegal everywhere. ",3,0,1441854694,1444731044
cuwd53a,0,t1_cuwcxx8,Riggaman,"Hey I don't agree with being charged more for it either, for what it's worth. 

I'm just saying that from an actuarial (risk) standpoint, however, they charge people more for traits that make them statistically more likely to cost them money. This makes since from a mathematical standpoint.

Could you imagine if Progressive said something like ""We're just going to start charging Asians more for car insurance, because...well, you know.""? They would never say something awful like that - but they probably would if they could get away with it. 

EDIT: changed the wording because I wouldn't actually ""love"" to see them say this. ",4,0,1441853272,1444731044
cuwbpjn,1,t3_3kbd4z,Riggaman,"Prior to the passage of the ACA, women were charged more for health insurance because they accumulated more health care costs over their lifetime. This is generally because of three factors: 1. Maternity, 2. OB/GYN and other women-specific care, and 3. Women are generally better about seeing a primary care physician earlier in life than men. This may keep them healthier, but they still rack up more costs long term than men (though costs even out significantly after 65, when Medicare is picking up most of the tab instead of private companies).

Car insurance, on the other hand, is based on *behavior*. By that I mean, generally speaking, men drive more aggressively and are therefore more likely to get into accidents than women (or at least serious accidents due to speed/aggression). This is an important distinction, because unlike health insurance, which is intended to cover preventive care in addition to hospital services, car insurance can more accurately be described as *accident* insurance. You don't use insurance for oil changes or tune ups, and the shitty (mostly unregulated) cost-sharing structure (e.g., deductibles) of car insurance means most small accidents are paid for out of pocket anyway. 

So when we talk about ""fairness"" we are really talking about equity in terms of what is and is not within people's control. Congress decided in 2010 that because women have no control over their gender they cannot be held accountable for the higher costs. Men, however, drive like dicks so it's generally OK from an legal standpoint to charge them more. ",20,0,1441850680,1444731044
