Thanks in advance. ",1,0,1444702634,1444719537

A larger dynasty league can become exhausting if the rules are complicated, but I'd never expect a tip from our guys because our money pool is pretty modest. If a guy tipped me, It'd be like 10 bucks or something, and that would be a little awkward.  Another league that I'm in has like a $1,000 prize pot, but the commissioner does almost no work except for dealing with everyone being a dick, which he basically encourages by being one himself *and* doing nothing to discourage the behavior.

cvolgmb,1,t3_3ngfz0,jackfinch,"OK, as a high school teacher, I saw the ""typically work about 50 hours a week,"" and thought, ""I'd be fine with that."" 55/60 is pretty typical for me, and my only surprise about your post is that people in other fields are always telling me how I have no idea how much harder it is in the private sector. Frankly though, I agree with you. While I think a 50/60 hour push week is reasonable,  it shouldn't be the pattern. I think it's not a great culture for American society. 

pre-response p.s.: I'll grant that teachers have decent benefits and most of the summers off. However, it's folly to argue that I have 3 months off, which is what I'm always told. I've consistently worked through 40 hour weeks on my ""vacation days"" during fall, winter, and spring ""break"" because it was the only way to catch up with work. When I'm doing summer work or writing curriculum in July and August, my friends are always confused because I ""have summers off.""",1,0,1444017906,1444719537

cvnfkrd,1,t3_3ne6l4,jackfinch,"As a moderate voter who has consistently voted for candidates from both parties, your question made me think seriously. I realized that for me, it hurt national republican candidates (not state or local). I guess in some ways it's pretty simple: in order for a Republican candidate (at the national level) to get my vote, I have to be convinced he's willing to compromise for the sake of governing and making the government work properly. If I don't hear him (or her) making those points, I won't vote for him. Frankly, I'm not interested in hardliners, and there is no clearly politicized (divided along party lines) issue that I feel so strongly about that I think it's worth shutting down the government.

Anecdotal: I once had a buddy to claimed that the Maryland store prices were way better. We went down there and other than the ability to buy Everclear and some really low-end stuff that was cheaper than we had in PA, the state stores in PA had better or equal prices. Maybe that was just where we went, but that's what I actually experienced.",1,0,1443413547,1444719537
