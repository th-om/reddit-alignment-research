cvxt6vr,0,t1_cvx29nf,U2_is_gay,"The only theater I typically go to is an indie theatre in Brooklyn. Yeah yeah I know how that sounds. But the place is great. They show old movies during brunch and at midnight. They have a table for every two seats. They serve alcohol, great food. There are ""ads"" before each movie but they are hilarious clips from old movies that are relevant to the film being shown. 

Tickets are only $11 or $12. And I've seen some great shit there. Jaws, The Warriors, Blood Simple, Friday, Mad Max 2 to name a few that I remember. It's definitely a unique theater experience. I know similar things exist all around the country.",1,0,1444709598,1444723506
