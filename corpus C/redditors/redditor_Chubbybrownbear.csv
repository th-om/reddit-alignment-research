cvnyhyw,1,t3_3n9q19,Chubbybrownbear,"The first thing you have to do is secure your property. Obviously there is training that you can do, and I would recommend hiring a certified dog trainer to help you with this process, but [the very first thing is to secure your property so small critters can't come in a new dog can't get out.](http://www.petplaygrounds.com/)

Greyhounds have a very strong hunting instinct. They were bred for this so that is something that you have to counter, and a trainer can help you. However it's important to realize that this is their instinct. That is what they were bred to do so you have to prevent this on to the fronts. Creating a physical barrier that's a virtually impossible for your greyhound to get into these situations and continual training by a professional trainer to counter those instincts needs to be your game plan.",1,0,1443980152,1444721364
cvny3es,1,t3_3nax55,Chubbybrownbear,A lot of dust could have probably have been prevented if you had a [better fencing system](http://www.  .com/). The real issue is that he got out of your yard. Scuffles with occur from time to time. Unless one dog is getting hurt most trainers will tell you to let the two dogs figure it out. Your neighbor shouldn't have tried to break them up with her hand because at the time those dogs could not remember their training to recall that they should invite human beings in that heated moment. From what you have described it sounds like they would have figured it out and not really done anything damaging if she hadn't gotten involved. But I understand why she did get involved because unless you know what is aggressive versus play versus figured it out a lot of things that dogs do to each other seem very rough.

cvnxr3a,0,t1_cvnxgfv,Chubbybrownbear,"Then it sounds like you have a perfectly normal dog. It takes a bit of time for a dog to find their spot. My dog's spot is in the right corner of my yard and he goes there every single time he poops. He doesn't poop anywhere else in my yard. And he takes a bit of time before he figures out the exact location where he wants to go and poop again. But he'll pee just about anywhere. 

Five minutes it's completely normal. Granted, I don't have him on a leash because I have a fenced in yard that was specifically made for dogs that dig, chew and climb. So it's a little easier to potty train a dog when you don't have to train him to be on a leash. ",1,0,1443978967,1444721364
cvnxg07,1,t3_3ndavo,Chubbybrownbear,"When I got my pup it took about three or four days before he stopped being scared of sounds or motions. The first few days are really important because dogs need to bond to you and feel like you are going to protect him and that they don't need to protect you. A lot of times this is simply spending time with the pup and reinforcing the behaviors like coming to you, sitting on your lap. Anything that has to do with them being affectionate with you, whatever.

Then they'll get more comfortable with their surroundings because they feel that you are going to protect them. It sounds like he doesn't feel like you will protect him. So I would recommend going back to basics and simply spending as much time as you can with him for 3 to 4 days in a row. Praise him for simply for being next to you. Treat him when he gets up and follows you into a new room. 

My pup went from being scared of cars that passed by and dogs that were barking to playing with adult pit bulls in just a couple weeks. It's possible, it just takes a lot of time and dedication and love.  ",1,0,1443978480,1444721364
cvnx4jt,1,t3_3neq6w,Chubbybrownbear,"Your dad isn't wrong. Corgis are known for digging under fences and getting out. You could try getting a [DIY fencing system that is meant for dogs that chew climb and dig to get out of a yard](http://www.petplaygrounds.com/). There's even a special coupon code for [Redditors](http://www.petplaygrounds.com/Reddit). But if you already have a fenced in yard I doubt your dad will want to put up a real dog fence. 

Does he ever poop outside? For example if you were outside with him long enough would he eventually poop? If so you can give him huge rewards (typically large treats) every time he poops outside. When he poops inside the house take him out immediately. If you don't catch it right away then you need to ignore it. Trying to scold him but simply make them confused because he doesn't know what you are yelling about & and being a straight you might just think that's a form of affection. 

You also want to make sure that there's nothing medically wrong with him. So grab some of his poop and take it to your vet and make sure that he doesn't have any diseases that would prevent him from being able to hold his poop and go outside when appropriate.",1,0,1443977989,1444721364

That's definitely not the reason. It's because it's not news. It's not interesting unless it's someone like Robin Williams. The media doesn't report on daily car fatalities either. It's not to prevent further tragedies. It's just not good news. ",1,0,1443824205,1444721364
