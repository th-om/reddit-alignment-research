Yeah, not all cops are the enemy.  Just the ones who abuse their power. Which is far too many of them, and they get away with those abuses far too often.",0,0,1443114898,1444726047

Bull.  Fucking.  Shit.

You said, and I fucking quote:

>This child, and his mother, have no regard for the other students, so how can they expect them to have empathy for them?

Trying to do something which is OK is not ""showing no regard for other students.""  That angry shit only makes sense if you think this is not okay.

Stop talking out of both sides of your mouth in order to attack others, and think about why you're such a bigot that you openly and blatantly lie.",0,0,1443114063,1444726047

We call it if there's a problem they can deal with without the police, but it if it worse then we call them and the police (sometimes you just need a police report), and have them document everything the cops do with enough eyes around that shutting us all down would create a huge uproar.

Not perfect, but a start, and I recommend everyone do the same thing in your own neighborhoods.",3,0,1443113189,1444726047
