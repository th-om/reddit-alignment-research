I can't understand the idea that it'd suffice to simply beat their ass AFTER being pepper sprayed, but you might have to resort to shooting them BEFORE being pepper sprayed.  ",1,0,1444604993,1444716478

cvwaiyo,0,t1_cvw611d,bigtoine,"Do you believe that killing someone is the only way to defend yourself? If not, I didn't say or even imply that I wouldn't defend myself if assaulted. I think suggesting that you punch and/or restrain your attacker qualifies as self defense in most places.

Also, I can't help but notice that neither you nor anyone else has addressed how you would accurately aim and fire a gun, successfully hitting your intended target and not someone else, while incapacitated by pepper spray. ",1,0,1444602692,1444716478
cvwab1k,0,t1_cvw476p,bigtoine,"Sorry, misread the headline. It's been a thousand mass shootings since Sandy Hook, which was a little under 3 years ago. Still, I think my point still holds when we're  averaging over 300 mass shootings a year. And I got that from The Guardian. ",0,0,1444602313,1444716478
cvvvkwz,0,t1_cvvt1w0,bigtoine,So are you saying there are a lot of instances this year in which a guy legally carrying a gun stopped a shooting spree before it happened and those instances are being kept secret?,1,0,1444578705,1444716478
cvvvjgc,0,t1_cvvrjuu,bigtoine,Well it is if the entire point of allowing concealed carry is so that good guys legally carrying their guns can stop the bad guys illegally firing their guns.,-4,0,1444578628,1444716478
cvvvgri,0,t1_cvvs2a1,bigtoine,"And how are they doing with that, given that we're averaging over 300 mass shootings a year for the last 3 years. 

Allowing concealed carry doesn't stop mass shootings any more than disallowing it does.  Concealed carry doesn't have anything whatsoever to do with the prevalence of mass shootings.  Sure, some guy might get off a lucky shot and stop an attack early, but for every time that happens, there's someone in a parking lot shooting at and missing burglars.  Or someone at a gas station who ends up shooting the guy he was trying to save from a car jacking.

EDIT: corrected a previous reference to having had 1000 mass shootings is the US this year.",-3,0,1444578485,1444716478
cvvv3u9,0,t1_cvvf932,bigtoine,"I don't think anyone believes that's true.  

However, some people might believe it's true that the chance that some bystander has a gun and is able to stop a violent incident before it starts does not outweigh the chance that some bystander has a gun and does more harm then good by shooting innocent people while trying and failing to stop a violent incident before it starts.

Some people might also believe it's true that allowing concealed weapons in places like this could make it harder to identify when someone is innocently carrying a gun and when someone is carrying a gun in order to use it for an attack.

Some people might believe that people who commit mass shootings don't usually pick their targets arbitrarily based on where they might encounter the least armed resistance, but rather pick places with some personal meaning to them, regardless of the gun control laws in place.

Some people might believe it's true that allowing concealed weapons in places can make it harder for the police to do their job when violence does occur, because the cops don't immediately know who's a good guy and who's a bad guy.",-21,0,1444577777,1444716478
cvvut8z,0,t1_cvvqh8q,bigtoine,"This is why I don't like people carrying guns in public.  It's not the gun that frightens me so much as the mindset of the guy carrying it who believes that this kind of escalation of violence is reasonable.  

If someone pepper sprays you, call the cops.  Or even punch them and restrain them so that they don't run away while you're calling the cops.  But don't shoot them.  For the love of god, why would you shoot them?  Pepper spray is not life threatening.  In the absence of some other form of attack, why would your first instinct be to kill someone who hit you with pepper spray?  

Not to mention that if you did get a shot of pepper spray to the face, you'd effectively be blind and incapacitated.  That's how pepper spray works.  So would your first instinct still be to start firing a gun?  That would be a pretty good way to start hitting innocent bystanders and end up charged with murder.

I honestly can't understand what benefit comes out of believing that the first reaction to any and all assaults should be firing a gun.",-9,0,1444577186,1444716478
cvvuezb,1,t3_3o5xac,bigtoine,"Two things.

1) Homosexuality being genetic doesn't equate to homosexuality being hereditary.  You'r making a leap of logic there that doesn't exist.

2) You seem to be assuming that if we weren't allowing gay people to get married, they would be left with no choice but to marry and breed with straight people, thereby passing on their homosexuality.  That's such a ludicrously arrogant concept that I can't even bring myself to take it seriously.",1,0,1444576379,1444716478
