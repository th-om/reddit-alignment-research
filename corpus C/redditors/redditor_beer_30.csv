That's why they are getting her to do so many town halls, having her dance on Ellen or do comedy on SNL, to try to make an emotional connection with voters, to make her seem more human.",1,1,1444699881,1444718342
cvxmpx4,1,t3_3oiw2c,beer_30,"I think that many people vote for President not so much because of their policies, but because of likeability, trust, and passion. They know they will be watching that person on TV every day for years and if their personality grates on them, or they feel they don’t totally trust them, they won’t be passionate about voting for them. It is not always just about the issues. It’s about who they want to lead them, and who they want to watch and listen to for the next several years.",1,1,1444698988,1444718342
cvxlfk6,1,t3_3oiino,beer_30,Chis Matthews is an old-school establishment pol through and through. He is the mouthpiece of the Democrat party just like Hannity is for the Republicans. He keeps calling Bernie a socialist because he shares the view that many have in the party that Bernie is too far to the left to get elected. The Democrat political establishment likes centrist candidates. ,1,0,1444697010,1444718342

cvvy5dm,0,t1_cvvxlsi,beer_30,"I will concede that high tech items are something that many people want the latest and greatest, and also clothes, they wear out or go out of fashion. But not everybody likes to replace these things every year or two. The next cell phone I buy I hope will last me 10. Also there are many other household goods we consume that shouldn’t need to be replaced every two years because of shoddy manufacturing and planned obsolescence. ",0,0,1444583367,1444718342
