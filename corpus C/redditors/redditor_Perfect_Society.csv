No evidence who in the White House was involved or what was discussed.  Not even close to the same thing, mainly because you have to have proof of something.  

Let me guess, you think that 9/11 was an inside job from the Bush White House to invade Iraq?",0,0,1443809871,1444720665

The deficits, while increased slightly, didn't increase over the period materially over what the trend was. This is seen by the California debt history by year.

Its not like its always in your favor or your opinions, it could be that next year Planned Parenthood is defunded, all marijuana use in the US is criminal and automatic weapons are able to be purchased without registration.  The next year we could have a full handgun ban, automatic weapon ban, legalized pot, no chaplains in the military, full pardons for murder if they served more than 15 years, and dramatically higher taxes.  Then we could have a reversal to what two years ago was.
