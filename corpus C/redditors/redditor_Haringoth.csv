cvxl5kx,0,t1_cvxkuxp,Haringoth,"Well I'm confident the President will not sign legislation that further erodes the power of the States. I am thrilled that the nations foremost 10th amendment advocate, /u/morallesson, is a member of the President's advisory panel. I'm confident that with such a powerful advocate, we will see an expansion of decentralization.",1,0,1444696583,1444725727
cvxjiwh,1,t3_3oilzk,Haringoth,"ExpiredAlphabits, in his capacity as CSS mod banned Finnishdude101 on multiple occasions. Banning a member from the Subreddit is *ipsa facto* removing said member from the party. As per the constitution in place at the time, a member could only be removed with a unanimous vote. This was not the case.

Edit: As per AdmiralJones42 note, I forgot a few things. 

When Expired was removed from leadership for repeatedly going after Finnish, he copied the entirety of the subscriber list. Shortly after, Smitty wet nuclear and a leadership election was called. Expired used the questionably obtained sub list to mail every member, including myself, and instructed them to vote for him. This is questionable at very best.

cvxi0ns,0,t1_cvxhc5i,Haringoth,"I plan on serving the President in whatever capacity he wishes. To be honest, I was a party back bencher when I was selected to accompany the President on the ticket. It is my distinct pleasure to be elevated to such a high honor, so no, I do not view it as a negative.

I'm fairly confident that congress can come together to pass Immigration reform - This issue enjoys bipartisan support, and is a crisis we can not allow to continue.

If any representative has a pet issue or bill they would like presented to the President, I am more than willing to be that point of contact.",1,0,1444691512,1444725727

The reality is that we are required to work across the aisle to get legislation passed; The impetus will be on us to introduce bills that work for all Americans. Having a strong opposition is a great way to keep everyone honest.",3,0,1444687151,1444725727

Our congressional delegation will be proposing exciting plans in both fields in the weeks to come, and I'd love the chance to work anyone to bring about positive change!
