Agreed, this is never done explicitly.

He was addressing the marriage of that day and age, and in particular divorce. 

> Ephesians 5 and 1 peter 3 EXPLICITLY define marriage as between ""husbands"" and ""wives"".

Maybe the authors of Ephesians and 1 Peter are incorrect. Scriptual norms also include slavery, so that alone doesn't seem to be sufficient. Unfortunate that slavery itself is not a sin except under certain conditions, yet homosexuality is unilaterally a sin.",3,0,1444613454,1444718852

> since we treat their writings and letters as the word of God.

You've contended that we must do so because the earliest Christians did, and we must follow their lead to function at all. I disagree, and have shown at least one way in which not accepting all of the New Testament as God-breathed scripture could be accomplished without rejecting every tenet of Christianity (Jefferson Bible).

Now, this could become somewhat of a slippery slope, as it could lead to the projection of one's own morals onto the Bible in order to determine what's right and wrong, instead of using the Bible to align one's moral compass. Yet I would argue we already do this - we don't accept slavery as morally righteous despite its biblical presence and implicit acceptance; we reject it because we know it is intrinsically wrong to own another human being as property. This [popular parody regarding context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK7P7uZFf5o) illustrates this well.",1,0,1444602954,1444718852
