cvxkuzm,0,t1_cvxk21f,KaliYugaz,"> But these are acts. 

And acts are based on beliefs. Harboring a personal disagreement is one thing. But what happens when a large number of people believe they shouldn't be vaccinated, the belief spreads farther and faster than the truth because it appeals to popular cognitive biases, and then they get together and vote for legislation that puts us all in danger?

>As it stands, society believes not vaccinating is harmful, so it is appropriate to make it mandatory. But declining to vaccinate is not the same as discussing whether or not the view that vaccination is positive is sufficiently backed-up, and has merit, and should be changed. That's what I am protecting, though, the discussion, the right to spout a belief that may or may not be true.

You're forgetting that there is is no legitimate discussion to be had about this topic, because there is no credible science supporting the anti-vaxxer view. It isn't a real controversy that could lead to any real intellectual progress, and it never will be for as long as there is no contrary evidence to the scientific consensus. Allowing them to speak freely is harmful to society because their ideas are dangerously false, and because doing so erodes our cultural norms that incentivize rationality in our public discourse by giving legitimacy to obvious bullshit. If you're wondering why Fox News is the way it is, **it's because of attitudes like yours.**

>If we were all more liberal and lax about things, and allowed each other to entertain thoughts we do not perceive as ""right"", progress can be made more quickly, because discussions get had, and good ideas bubble to the top more quickly, and bad ideas to the bottom.

Bullshit. This is just a faith-based belief of yours. It could just as easily be the case that bad ideas win out because they are more emotionally appealing and simpler to understand than fragile, complex, inconvenient truths.",1,0,1444696137,1444718358
cvxk3uh,0,t1_cvxhipk,KaliYugaz,"> But war is less rampant, and violent crime down (at least in the west). Did we do this by stopping people from talking about certain things? Is it not the east who have more restrictions upon speech than us? Who make certain things sacred, and blasphemy a killable offence, etcetera?

I don't think you understand how history and society actually works. The progress of the Enlightenment, and the peace and stability of the post-WWII order, were indeed a result of many garbage ideas becoming so discredited that voicing them in public today will get you banned from most institutions and ostracized from decent society.

Places like the Middle East are shit because they operate with a shit ideological framework, and resist all the better ones. Good countries to live in are good because they operate based on a good ideological framework, and resist all the obviously bad ones. It's not that hard to understand. ",1,0,1444694937,1444718358
cvxjkpl,0,t1_cvxj5a9,KaliYugaz,"> I believe that incorrect opinions are not so harmful as to demand censorship, and the same goes for racist thoughts.

So not vaccinating your children isn't harmful to society? Ignoring climate change isn't harmful to society? Erosion of the norms of rational public discourse by charlatans and liars isn't harmful to society? Racism *isn't harmful to society?* 

All this is exactly what I expected. You Free Speech Warriors are so fanatical about protecting your entitlement to act like moronic pieces of shit that you're willing to throw all of civilization to the dogs for its sake. It's like a fundamentalist religion; no amount of disaster or human suffering will ever convince you to yield on your sacred principles.",2,0,1444694048,1444718358
cvxivcm,0,t1_cvxiiq5,KaliYugaz,">  This is nothing like how society and political opinions work, so I'd say it's a bad analogy.

Actually, we do in fact have social sciences like *political science* and *economics* and *psychology* and *sociology*, and the experts in those fields have identified a limited range of ideas that agree with evidence and reason as well. So there are indeed false social and political opinions out there that ought to be severely discouraged.",2,0,1444692893,1444718358
cvxi3wq,0,t1_cvxhsp8,KaliYugaz,"Does ""the Universe"" reach down and physically prevent crappy submissions from being published in academic journals?

No. Your objection really doesn't matter, what is going on is still censorship. The scientific community suppresses whatever the universe doesn't agree with, as judged by the proper epistemic standards of science. And that's a good thing.",2,0,1444691662,1444718358
cvxh7mj,0,t1_cvxguf5,KaliYugaz,"> So we should force them to be? We should make them obey?

Yes, and we absolutely must do so in order to protect our civilization from these kinds of people. Once the norms ensuring civic and intellectual virtue are too far eroded, a functional, open, democratic society becomes impossible.

>Some were harassing, and those individuals should have been banned. Instead we took away rights from a many, because a small minority abused them.

If there is a hole in a tire, you patch up the tire. But if holes *keep on* forming in the tire, you have to throw the tire out.

Don't be a naif. If you've spent more than a month on the internet, you'll know that a whole lot of people sure as hell aren't interested in truth or in rational debate. We shouldn't be collectively handicapping ourselves (or destroying ourselves, if the stakes are high enough) just to humor their garbage opinions in the name of ""free speech"".

>If you treat intolerance and bigotry with your own intolerance and bigotry, where does that leave society?

In a better, morally improved place. To paraphrase Karl Popper, as soon as you decide to tolerate intolerance, the open society is vulnerable to being hijacked and destroyed by those who oppose it.",6,0,1444688381,1444718358
