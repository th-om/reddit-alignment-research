cvxwc74,1,t3_3ojfeh,thewalkingfred,Haha if they want to go start a war they can do it themselves. I'll die before I go fight in a war because a Saudi told me to.,1,0,1444717737,1444729340
cvxvq0p,0,t1_cvxttub,thewalkingfred,"I feel the same way. I know there is blame on both sides, I know Israel has done some messed up things to the Palestinians, treating them as second-class, putting them in bureaucratic hell to immigrate, building settlements on their land. But at least they have tried to reach some sort of peace agreement. 

The Palestinians, or at least Hamas, will not stop fighting until Isreal is gone or they are, and Israel isn't going anywhere any time soon. I feel like Israel should just annex the west bank and gaza, expel Hamas, and start providing real fucking aid and development to those areas.",32,0,1444715807,1444729340

cvxmcvy,0,t1_cvxlzwh,thewalkingfred,"Thats true, it is different and it is good that we are vetting the groups better and mostly just providing ammo but people are just tired of our government spending so much money funneling weapons into the middle east. We caused the instability that ISIS is thriving in right now. Both countries we ""Freedomized"" are clusterfucks of radical islamist groups with corrupt, ineffective governments who are distrusted by the majority of the population. And now that Russia is involved, the chances of some fuck-up escalating the whole situation into a larger war increases.

I say we cut our losses at this point, maybe work with Russia to take down ISIS and use that as a ""trust-building"" experience to maybe cool tensions between us and them. No one wants war with Russia, especially over fucking Syria. ",5,0,1444698434,1444729340

cvxlxwd,0,t1_cvxicdm,thewalkingfred,"He's laughing at you not realizing than a huge chunk of the weapons ISIS has are American weapons they stole from the Iraqi army. Chances are some of this ammo will end up in ISIS guns soon enough.

We need to just pull the fuck out of the middle east. Oil is the past, we need to focus on new sources of energy anyway and we drill enough of our own oil that we can do without financing yet another dictatorship or ""moderate"" rebel group.",4,0,1444697799,1444729340
