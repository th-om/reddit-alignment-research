No, I don't see your point, I'm sorry.

The point was to highlight a problem that state funded universities are currently facing using a real life example.

> And that's the primary reason it should be handled at the state level, not the Federal level.

Again I fail to see your point. Why should that stop the federal government from providing funds to state run universities? There's a nation wide higher education crisis. Higher education is prohibitively expensive everywhere. Why shouldn't the federal government be allowed to act in the interest of the people and address an issue that's affecting the nation as a whole?

>You know what priorities there are for your state, I know what priorities there are for my state. 
 
I agree that states should be allowed to prioritize things as they feel is appropriate. The point I'm trying to make is that state governments don't always act in the interest of the people. People across the country are concerned about the exorbitant cost of higher education. No one, as far as I know, is complaining that we don't build enough basketball stadiums. 

You have to ask yourself: Is it truly the priority of the people of Wisconsin to spend $220 million on a new stadium while simultaneously cutting $300 million from the state's university system? Or are those the priorities of the powers that be?

> If I were to put in a proposition to, say, move all funding from Wisconsin to California, it'd probably pass since the population of California is seven times larger than Wisconsin.

That's not how things work. Population only affects number of representatives in the house. Not only is your example virtually impossible, I don't see how it applies to the discussion. Maybe you could clarify on this?",1,1,1444689377,1444728814
cvx77vq,0,t1_cvx6d1s,albertoroa,"I don't have the answers to those questions. Those are all things that should definitely be discussed. I think the federal government should get involved because there's clearly a higher education problem all across the country and leaving the issue for states to handle alone clearly isn't working. 

When there are state governments like Wisconsin, which pulled $300 million in funding from the university of Wisconsin school system and then gave $300 million to build a new professional sports stadium, it becomes necessary to acknowledge that state governments don't always act in the best interest of the people.
