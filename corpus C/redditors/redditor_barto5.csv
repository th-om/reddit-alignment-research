Had a buddy in a pretty serious wreck.  His leg is laid open to the bone.  First responder asks if he's hurt anywhere else he says:

""Well, my lats are a little sore"" from working out that morning.

Why?

This ones got a crack in it.


My kids love this joke.  Actually they hate it, but I love it!  And that's really the point, isn't it?",1,0,1444703933,1444723095

""You're doing this really well.

That shit has got to change!

You're really doing great at something else.""

He would never criticize anyone without sandwiching the criticism between two slices of praise.  He was a pretty good boss.",2,0,1444664038,1444723095
cvwzdvs,1,t3_3ocqe5,barto5,">Reddit I'm confused. I tried to give as much context as was necessary to understand a very straight forward issue.

Which part of this issue is straight-forward:  Religion or Teenagers?

cvwyz04,0,t1_cvwyuas,barto5,"It's a great book.  It literally changed me from pro-death penalty to anti. Because while I always knew there were innocent men on death row, I never figured that some of them were there *on purpose.*

You'll want to kick the prosecutor in the balls after reading this story for sure.",2,0,1444662925,1444723095

Read John Grisham's true story of *The Innocent Man*.

That will give you a fuller, more detailed example of 'That's the way it is.'

TL/DR:  It's fucked up.",2,0,1444662332,1444723095

cvwun16,0,t1_cvwt7j2,barto5,"> We expected a 5-6 win team, but 7-9 or 8-8 is probably closer to where hey are at. I know it's from a shitty division, but we should be in the thick of the playoff race in December. Could you imagine saying that in the first year of a rebuild with the year we had in 2014?


I can't imagine saying that right now. I thought we would win 6 - 7 games.  I think we'll be fortunate to get to six wins now and sure don't think we'll be in the thick of anything in December.

But it's frustrating as hell right now to think a handful of plays going they other way we could be 3 and 1, or even 4 and 0.
