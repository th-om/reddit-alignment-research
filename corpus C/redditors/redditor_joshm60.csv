To play peasant's advocate for a moment...

Because 1280x720 is exactly 1/3 the vertical and 1/3 the horizontal resolution of 3840x2160, and therefore there is an exact 1:9 mapping of the 720p, but 900p doesn't map to 4k exactly, it's possible that the 720p upscaled to 4k looks better than a 900p on a 4k TV (at least on 4k TVs that don't scale images well). Although, I could be very wrong about that.

Regardless, I'm sure the XBone apologist didn't have that in mind...

>My question is this: would HAES activists honestly have me believe that they would refuse to take this pill? That they would give up an actually healthy body on the principle that thinner=/=healthy.

I would be in support of this pill, and see no good reason to oppose it. In a similar manner, I support pills that reduce the effects of alcohol for those who struggle with alcohol dependency (which have proven to be effective), pills that would take away an addict's desire to abuse drugs, hypothetical pills to reduce procrastination, make me more friendly towards others, make me more confident, etc., etc., etc.

Ideally, one would control their weight without needing medication to help. But what a lot of fat-shamers don't realize is that no one is perfect, and that what's easy for most people can be very difficult for others (anyone who disagrees should read [this excellent comment](https://customchallengecoindesigns.wordpress.com/2015/09/03/a-good-explanation-for-why-people-are-fat-by-ueavc/)(credit goes to /u/eavc)). Pain, sadness, boredom, loneliness, routine, socially embedded temptation, fatigue, stress, cognitive biases, competing demands, family crisis, fear, money issues, disease, social learning, etc., all can make something that's otherwise easy for other people really difficult for others. For that person, it makes a lot of sense to use such a pill to give himself/herself a leg up in life.

I'm sure most people who are overweight would readily take such a pill.

I'm willing to bet that Andy Lee punted on the opponent's side of the field during his rookie year a lot more than Pinion.

Although, if Pinion can become consistent, his average yards per punt will go up significantly. I kind of wish we kept Lee as well though, as more consistency on punts would've been worth a roster spot IMHO.",1,0,1444545033,1444725329

> This isn't a strawman argument, it's a question.

The strawman argument was this:

>You're arguing two opposing points, one is against raising minimum wage to help families that, in your opinion, are overpopulating, and the other is supporting entire countries who have overpopulated at the cost of my own customs, culture and traditions.

^^^_This_ was the strawman...

>What you're proposing is that rather than each society attempt to create it's own future generations of workers and such, we should just import labour from countries that will never stop having children.

What I'm _actually_ saying is that since there are enough people willing to immigrate to replenish the workforce, having current citizens pumping out children is unnecessary at best. So if you want to have kids of your own to pass on your culture and traditions, that's a **luxury**, _not_ a need.

>Minimum wage, to me, should provide every person with the ability to live. Two people on minimum wage should have zero issues raising a normal sized family.

But ""Two people on minimum wage [. . .] raising a normal sized family"" requires a **_lot_** more money than ""every person with the ability to live.""

My attitude toward minimum wage is that every full-time worker should have all of _their_ needs met (including having safety nets in place in case they get sick and get laid off, etc.) plus a little more. But it's the individual's responsibility to be careful about what luxuries they choose with that ""little more."" Raising a family is a _very_ expensive luxury (_not_ a need). Furthermore, they probably aren't doing the society a favor by raising a family, unless they happen to raise the next Albert Einstein, because overpopulation is an issue that affects every country (even ones with declining populations). If they want that luxury, it's on them.",0,0,1444511706,1444725329

They want to win the irrelevant micro-argument because they know they can't win the main point, which is that everyone deserves equal rights.

Even worse than that, arguing that sexual orientation is a choice is implicitly grants their premise that same-sex relationships would be wrong if sexual orientation were a choice.

As a gay guy, I agree. Using ""born this way"" as a reason for why same-sex relationships are acceptable would be to implicitly say that same-sex relationships would be wrong if one could choose their sexual orientation. It also implies that bisexuals shouldn't choose to be in same-sex relationships.

That being said, LGBT rights organization use this very bad argument for a very good reason: It's a very effective way of changing people's minds. It's sad that the effective way of changing people's minds in favor of LGBT rights is an argument that carries anti-LGBT sentiment in it, but it's the strategic thing to do.
