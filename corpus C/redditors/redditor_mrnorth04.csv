Back then it was about a good number of police officers being out of control and not being held accountable for the bad things that they do. It makes no sense to me why race needed to be brought in. If they had stuck with ""the police are militarized and out of control, we need to start holding them accountable for their abuses and reform our criminal justice system,"" I think they had a very good chance of getting some meaningful change. It seems like that got hijacked by the racial grievance crowd who would rather throw bombs than actually accomplish anything. ",10,0,1440679466,1444721396

Edit: Just to clarify: what I mean is that no food service employee is going to tell someone they're fat because they know they would get fired for that doing that.",122,0,1440412550,1444721396
