cvxkjdj,0,t1_cvx8gay,redditor77492,"Nah, Hillary's campaign has already straight up said they're working with her super PAC, Correct the Record, but it's somehow ""legal"":

> Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign plans to work in tight conjunction with an independent rapid-response group financed by unlimited donations, another novel form of political outsourcing that has emerged as a dominant practice in the 2016 presidential race.

> On Tuesday, Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton rapid-response operation, announced it was splitting off from its parent American Bridge and will work in coordination with the Clinton campaign as a stand-alone super PAC.

> That befuddled many campaign finance experts, who noted that super PACs, by definition, are political committees that solely do independent expenditures, which cannot be coordinated with a candidate or political party. Several said the relationship between the campaign and the super PAC would test the legal limits.

cvvzkft,1,t3_3obikk,redditor77492,"Ah, good old /r/politics. A Wordpress blog writes a highly sensationalized (if not straight up dishonest) article on Saturday that gets upvoted to the front page even though the [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3o7zlp/baltimore_police_can_find_no_records_to_support/cvuufbx) is about how the article was sensationalized?

Better upvote the Wordpress blog to the front page again on Sunday for another sensationalized article!

I wonder what was the author's source for Carson being a vegetarian at the time, since he certainly didn't cite it. The best I can find is an article from Vegetarian Times from 25 years ago, but that's still 5 years removed from the nebulous ""30 or more"" years ago timeframe his campaign has given.

Not saying the incident did or didn't happen, but can we at least stop posting these sensational Wordpress blogs /r/politics?",15,0,1444585642,1444724516
