cvw4hak,0,t1_cvvuieh,senormoll,"People keep making this comparison, but it's not a valid one economically.  The exchange rate tells you next to nothing about the domestic cost of goods.  You need to know other factors such as the cost of similar commodities (especially those that might replace burgers at meal decision time) and average income.  Even comparing prices across regions of the U.S. is not apples to apples.

Anecdotally though, I've lived in NJ, NY, DC, and OK.  I've never felt like $14 is expensive for a burger unless it's a TGI Friday's or ""burger joint"".  If it's a halfway decent restaurant, or in this case doing something artisanal like an ""espresso burger"", expecting less than $14 after tip is kind of naive.",1,0,1444593146,1444727934

cvuxqbz,0,t1_cvuu70e,senormoll,"> in fact the people that are most upset are legal immigrants who did it legally and fairly

Legally, sure.  But we should be careful about throwing the word ""fair"" around.  The U.S. uses a lottery system to choose visa applicants, and they have limits set on a per-country basis.  Anyone that came here legally from Guatemala is quite literally luckier than the winner of last week's mega-million.  For the vast majority of illegal immigrants, the option for doing it ""legally and fairly"" didn't exist in any practical sense.  You're definitely right in the sense that one group broke the law and the other didn't, though.

>Now is the system suck to become a citizen? It could, but again by definition they are illegal and are breaking the law.

They're only illegal so long as the law says they are.  An obvious statement I know, but it's germane to the discussion because the whole debate is over giving them a path to citizenship to make them *not* here illegally.  If someone says ""let's decriminalize marijuana"", the response can't be ""no way! It's illegal!""  

Out of curiosity, do you find anything about his quote inaccurate?  ""Fabric of our country"" may be a loaded phrase, but undocumented workers *are* a really crucial part of this economy.  We can disagree about how big of a problem that is or what the solution should be, but his statement seems to be pretty factual.",3,0,1444498224,1444727934

They'd really be considered refugees by any meaningful definition, but it's such a loaded term now that it seems most people are hesitant to use it.  [Nationwide crime in El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_El_Salvador), for instance, looks like the worst American inner cities.  

It should also be noted that most undocumented workers came here on a visa and never left.  Most probably never intended to leave, but they didn't technically do anything illegal until their visa expired.  And even that is a very minor offense (punishable only by making you leave) compared to Americans *hiring* the undocumented workers, which is legitimately criminal.",22,0,1444497037,1444727934
