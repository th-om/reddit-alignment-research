cvpa41m,1,t3_3nlgcg,thechaserx,So no one told me life was going to be this waaaayyyy *SHALASHASKA*,28,0,1444075593,1444721801
cvjlwif,0,t1_cvjk3aa,thechaserx,"Sorry, what I meant was: an illegal immigrant would know what they are committing a crime(s). His post about people doing it everyday without realizing that kinda didn't make sense.",1,0,1443639646,1444721801
cvjcrc6,0,t1_cvj93wl,thechaserx,On purpose though?,1,0,1443626628,1444721801
cvf1xye,0,t1_cvf1hvo,thechaserx,Yeah I know what you mean. Just know that it's very quality work. That kind of talent doesn't need to be wasted. Honestly I just want to see it animated. Haha. ,2,0,1443295007,1444721801
cvf15ci,1,t3_3mhrzq,thechaserx,"Dude, this is amazing! This is why I'm still subscribed to this sub. Real diamond in the rough stuff. I honestly think that it could be more than a web comic. Keep up the good work.",6,0,1443293523,1444721801
cvdul8z,1,t3_3mcffq,thechaserx,"There's no way to prove it, but I still think something is fishy about it. Then again, it could just be sensationalist crap that the news networks dig up for views. I've gotten to the point where if a news story makes me say, ""Why is this in national news?"" then it's either part of an agenda or, like I said before, simply sensationalist garbage.",1,0,1443196388,1444721801
cvcknst,1,t3_3m74y3,thechaserx,"It's funny that you mentioned this, the last time I played MGSV, I was doing the same thing before I got off for the night. He does appear to still be alive, though I don't know if its a glitch or not.",2,0,1443105189,1444721801
cugaw68,0,t1_cug8xbx,thechaserx,Thank you for saying that! Too many people forget that everything you say on the internet is permanent.,2,0,1440601066,1444721801
cueihp3,0,t1_cuecijb,thechaserx,"I seem to recall, from an article a few years back, that Lucasfilm bought the rights to use a lot of deceased actors and actresses in digital recreations. Maybe this is a case where they actually use them.
