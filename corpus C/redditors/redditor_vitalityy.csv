cvxru7o,0,t1_cvxpxha,vitalityy,The entire gametype is changed with orbital strikes..which are random.  Thats beyond stupid.,2,0,1444707106,1444717428
cvxrmxf,1,t3_3oj2c7,vitalityy,"Normally Id say this doesnt matter, because battlefield 4 has VOIP and next to no one uses it.  The difference is with a server browser you have a lot of servers that also advertise free public teamspeaks..part of that community that is fostered with servers being run by clans and sortered on a browser...something this game wont have, and a big part of why Im not buying it",10,0,1444706750,1444717428
cvxrle6,0,t1_cvxrcym,vitalityy,text chat is worthless when your in game looking to call out a spot or ask for help.,12,0,1444706673,1444717428

cvxg51u,0,t1_cvxfkl7,vitalityy,"Even without the injury to tex, after that trade, the bluejays were a better team all around and I think it's very homer to think the Yankees would have won that division.  And news flash, every franchise has obnoxious fans.  I have no issue with Toronto.  I've enjoyed so much more success than they have their quips aren't even on my radar.

cvxensk,1,t3_3oi0b6,vitalityy,wow op is a psycho.  Id rather know I lost the division to a world series team than some scrub team that got bounced in the alds.,24,0,1444686173,1444717428
cvx2dqw,0,t1_cvx200z,vitalityy,Sounds like the game is just dying on console then...,1,0,1444668400,1444717428
cvwzni9,0,t1_cvwxldx,vitalityy,On pc there is a sort by list which has tons of boxes to check from map rotation and game type to ticket count and vehicle  respawn time,1,0,1444664063,1444717428
cvwx0nw,0,t1_cvwwwxp,vitalityy,I admittedly have no idea how server browsers work on consoles...there's still a list you can scroll through correct?  I always assume people that use quick join are just stupid...since you can literally filter out anything you don't want with a browser ,1,0,1444659409,1444717428
cvwwvt0,0,t1_cvwwi1a,vitalityy,"Quick match only uses official ranked servers in battlefield 4.  So if you can't handle reading the server descriptions on the browser just use quick join.   And allowing multiple people to spawn on someone has no bearing on map flow at all.  I could just as easily rocket up there myself.  The game in is current state will be dead within a year.  The matchmaking is atrocious, the spawn system is laughable, and the mechanics in general are on par with a generic shooter.  The Star Wars ip is the only thing keeping this game relevant.  You can't have a game type like walker assault requiring a great deal of teamwork and leave it to complete chance since I have no control over getting on a team with friends.",1,0,1444659141,1444717428
