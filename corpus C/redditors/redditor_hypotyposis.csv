cvwate3,0,t1_cvw7r9t,hypotyposis,I get that. I'm just wondering why you think that?,2,0,1444603188,1444723049
cvw4uqy,0,t1_cvw18lu,hypotyposis,What about term limits for the president? Could the same not be said?,1,0,1444593674,1444723049
cvw4ru9,0,t1_cvw3vkl,hypotyposis,Which Republicans do you think are actually in favor of gun control but maintain a facade of being against it for re-election purposes and why do you think this?,2,0,1444593562,1444723049
cvw37cg,0,t1_cvw2a2y,hypotyposis,"Regarding 2, as a liberal very much in favor of gun control, I believe you are letting your personal views cloud your judgement.

Many people inherently favor gun control. The majority of both the Senate and House is Republican. When term limits are imposed, people in their last term will vote with true views rather than what gets them re-elected, at least theoretically. However, if people truly do not support gun control, which it seems like the majority of the Senate and House do not, then gun control will not pass because of the imposition of term limits.",1,0,1444591239,1444723049
cvw123o,1,t3_3ocruy,hypotyposis,"You say he won't be beginning his Senate campaign until 6 months before the election, but it's not like he's not campaigning until then. He's getting tons of press coverage in his presidential campaign, which will likely translate well to his Senate campaign.",27,0,1444587970,1444723049
cvw0rd4,1,t3_3ocsfb,hypotyposis,"1) Why do you believe term limits are an inherently conservative idea?

2) Why do you believe term limits are connected to gun control?",7,0,1444587520,1444723049
cvszwkp,1,t3_3nynj9,hypotyposis,"Dude same boat (first time seeing LD live and first concert in about 5 years) and that was legit! I splurged on the Meet and Greet package and got to meet him before hand. It was amazing how nice and genuine he comes across as and he's wayyy shorter than I thought he'd be and pretty damn skinny.

Here's a pic from my view in the crowd: http://imgur.com/gGDLiZg",2,0,1444341212,1444723049
cvsztvw,1,t3_3nzq45,hypotyposis,"I regret splurging on the Meet and Greet package. All we got was to meet him, take a picture, and get a free shirt and ONE slice of pizza. I could've just bought a shirt afterwards and apparently taken a picture with him afterwards.

But overall great show.",2,0,1444341098,1444723049
cvqn8hl,0,t1_cvqmy30,hypotyposis,Understood. I was just saying that merely doing below 10% now is not doing poorly.,1,0,1444171486,1444723049
cvqmt9d,0,t1_cvqhr35,hypotyposis,It seems to be exclusive use by the neighbor. OP has not been using the property in dispute at all.,1,0,1444170764,1444723049
