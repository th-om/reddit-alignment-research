You do know that this has been common practice for like, ever, since email become common place?

I'll just leave these 5 MILLION emails here for you to look at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_email_controversy

Or the fact the no one in congress has to comply with rules around what accounts to use or even retention requirements!

This is a huge scandal and we are losing our national sense of self and history, not to mention security and integrity.

So I am not excusing her (what a moron she is on this) but I am saying that this has been, and continues to be, a VERY common and unregulated practice and used in some extremely shady ways that dwarf anything she may have done.

But no one seems to remember or care about these facts because ITS NOT HILLARUH!

I think they have been since this all came up?

Its not like there were policies or rules in place, this is new territory in a shifting landscape. While I think it was lame as shit for her to even think about doing this (her and everyone else in the gov doing it) once it was raised as an issue I do think she released 55k+ emails representing all of her mail spool to the authorities for review but I may be mistaken. (dont confuse 'public release' with 'released to those with authority to review' like the average nightly news viewer does).

So given that
A) She broke no rules
B) when asked she turned it over
C) the gov't entity (state dept) with oversight is in the process of overseeing it

Isn't the real problem that for the last 20 years the government has not had regulations around this until just recently? 

I'm glad that SOME sort of rules are being put in place. If nothing else this witchhunt has pushed that (and you just KNOW members of congress are pissed about it given how much off-gov't-server email they generate).

On this topic her perspective is that voting is too important to be automatic. It should be an act of intent and by going back to compulsory voting or even automatic registration (like we just got in California) you are returning to the ward style politics of the 19th century. 

I thought it was a well-thought out and legitimate perspective. My reply was that laws like this are attempting to bring in disenfranchised voters and she agreed that if people WANT to participate we need to make it easier for them.

This is a ridiculous reason. The reason oil supplies keep increasing is because as humans we are awesome at technology. Previously uneconomical sources of oil are now commonly and cost effectively harvested. 

It has nothing to do with 'finding more because we are exploring' and everything to do with new techniques and technology. Any past forecast of reserves is predicated on technology at the time that estimate was made.

We pretty much *know* where the oil is or is likely to be, its all about how much of that is recoverable. This is what drives oil availability, the pursuit of technology to recover more of these previously unrecoverable reserves. Its fascinating.

Never bet against human ingenuity, we are pretty smart monkeys.

The big win is that it lets you get a cut of the charity donations rather then forcing the charity to pay up front. Everyone wins!

RE: Negative reviews - Not really and I have heard anecdotally that this is still a problem. Our way of dealing with it is to ***never launch a product that depends on Apple as a promotional vehicle***. The chances of getting the viral interest needed to win there are very small and not worth investing in (for us). If you know your game is AMAZING and its free and you monetize in-app then you might be able to play the appstore game but the odds are long and not in your favor.
