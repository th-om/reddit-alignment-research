For the same amount of weight in the deadlift versus sumo deadlift, the strain on the MCL is three-to-five times greater. So you and OP could be trading banged up knees and thighs for repetitive ligament injuries in the MCL. Source: my buddy who is a kinesiology graduate student and in enviable shape, and a personal trainer.


I find the best way to prevent banged up knees on the way down is at the top of the descent: I visualize myself sitting down onto a bench or a chair when I start dropping down. This causes me to stick my hips out enough to get my knees out of the way and, surprisingly, my lats tend to engage more this way. 

Don't outright bend at the waist, but sit on an invisible bench.",3,0,1444500870,1444727222

cvpfhgx,0,t1_cvpek9s,MathAndFerrets,"Well, yes. There is a natural fluctuation in climate on a 1,000-10,000 year time scale that is always going on in the background. To observe the climate change we have already observed in, say, the last 50 years, one would normally have to observe our planet for thousands of years.

To elaborate a bit, statistics provide a good way of measuring the scale of an event. If a flood of a certain magnitude occurs, on average, every X years, we say it is a ""1 in X years event."" If multiple events occur year after year with a large value of X, this suggests our measurements from the past X years do not accurately reflect the current state of things. For example, the red river valley floods in North Dakota and Minnesota from 2008-2010, which were 500+ year floods, or, for example, Tropical Storm Sandy was a 700 year event. These events are occurring more and more often, so one question that climatic statisticians usually want to answer is ""how many of these events are 'extra' or 'too many,' and how many 'extra' events can be explained by human activity?""

The answers to these questions are upsetting. The answer is usually 'many are extra, and most of these extras cannot be explained by natural fluctuations on long time scales.""",1,0,1444083930,1444727222
cvpdua4,0,t1_cvpcmq8,MathAndFerrets,"The point of science is to determine truth without an agenda.

Most scientists involved in the field are convinced... Flat out CONVINCED... Based on data and their discussions with colleagues... That climate change is not only real but human caused.

What is the agenda of someone pushing for denying climate change? The status quo. If acientists are pushing for an agenda, that agenda is environmental responsibility and stewardship.

This isn't a case where both sides are equal. After all, even if climate change is not happening, no one wants to see it happen, and no one wants benzene dumped in our rivers, etx.",2,0,1444081213,1444727222
cvpdk4y,0,t1_cvpcim2,MathAndFerrets,"He may be smart, but he is apparently not very good at his job. He's confused climate for an electrical engineering problem.

In seriousness, though.. Graduation day at Stanford, you just received Masters degree in EE. You got a Masters in Applied Math a few years before that. Your options? Apply for a job at any of the world's power companies, or NERC, or, heck, even IBM or Microsoft to work on networks, or a cushy but low paid government job. Goddamned world at your doorstep, from ambitious to relaxed.

What does this guy do? Re-enroll for another fucking Masters in *exactly the same discipline*, getting paid 20k a year to teach Laplace transforms to undergrads.

Conclusion? No one would hire him. 

In seriousness, there are very math heavy PHD tracks at big universities strictly designed around climate and weather modeling. This guy's only experience with these models and their behavior is from his experience in a government position during a very anti-climate-change, denialist administration.

cvpc1ck,1,t3_3nm1qq,MathAndFerrets,"From the second article (which has a distinctly more aggressive tone): 

> ‘I choose my choice feminism’ is a product of libertarian thinking and an American neoliberalist ideology  that tells us that true freedom is about individuals being free to do whatever the fuck they want whenever they want, regardless of how their actions impact society at large, in particular the marginalized.

This is maybe a little black-and-white, but I largely agree. I have a hard time reconciling the notion that society is greater than the sum of its parts with the notion that individual freedom optimizes societal freedom. 'Choice feminism' disregards at least one idea: the choices made by you have an effect upon the choices available to others, and thus your choices can have a negative impact on the treatment other people receive.

An easy example: if Michelle Bachmann were to be elected president and banned abortions and made pray-the-gay-away clinics mandatory, its clear to me that these decisions could not, in any way, be constituted as feminist decisions. Providing a ""feminist"" label to any decision made by a woman is as bad as slapping a ""patriarchal"" or ""chauvinist"" label on any decision ever made by a man.",12,0,1444078397,1444727222

cvhayri,0,t1_cvh9mig,MathAndFerrets,"1)  The etymology of ""ask"" includes both pronunciations, and it appears that the ""incorrect"" pronunciation *has a longer history* than the pronunciation you are claiming is correct. This isn't a matter of linguistic diversity, its a matter of historical fact, going back to the roots of the English language.

2) No modern scholars in linguistics would ever attempt to prove that one dialect is superior or more pure than another dialect. In part, this is becaise linguistics is a *strictly descriptive* discipline; linguistics asks ""given a language dispersed geographically and socially in particular ways, what variations and similarities arise?"" But, furthermore, proof is for mathematicians and alcoholics. Only sloppy physicists will say ""we have proven the existence of a Higgs Boson!"" That is bad science. They will say ""we have collected mountains of observations that coincide with theoretical predictions of fundamental particles like the Higgs Boson!""

No self respecting linguist would say ""we have proven dialect X is more pure than dialect Y,"" just like no self respecting anthropologist would say ""we have proven culture X is superior to culture Y.""

cvh2ldy,0,t1_cvh0o2c,MathAndFerrets,"I think you will find everyone is human and consequently lives their lives in a way that is not totally consistent with their set of values. This is true of feminists and men's rights activists and Democrats and Republicans and scientists and young earth creationists. Personally, I think violence is abhorrent, but I would be willing to engage in violence to defend myself or my family.

I think you will also find that a person's set of ideals is, oftentimes, impractically idealistic compared to reality. As above, this is true of feminists and men's rights activists and Democrats and Republicans and scientists and young earth creationists. Personally, I don't think race or gender should have any effect in social interactions, and yet I know this will never come to be. 

All you have done is to establish that a practical consideration many feminists hold, that one should be wary of rape when around strange men, contradicts the idealistic notion we hold, that gender should not be a consideration in social interactions. 

Similarly, there is the practical level in your own behavior: you still lock your valuables at home and you still lock your car in dangerous neighborhoods.  And yet, I surmise that, ideally, you believe we should not live in a world where property theft or violence is a consideration in social situations.

The cognitive dissonance within someone holding an idealistic value in contradiction with their practical behavior can be very dramatic.  This is especially true if the practical behavior lacks social utility. Look, for example, at someone who smokes cigarettes but thinks they are gross and wants to quit, or someone morbidly obese who wants to lose weight but eats at burger king all the time. These people tend to tear themselves up inside over the stress of that dissonance.

Schroedinger's rapist is NOT that situation, because so many people find such a practical value and utility from being careful in their lives. It is much easier for me to hold Schroedinger's rapist in mind *while simultaneously lamenting that I feel like I must* than it is for me to smoke a cigarette while wishing I could quit.",1,0,1443460886,1444727222
