cvxnpjy,0,t1_cvxlw9z,Jas9191,Yep this is right.  Idk which expansion it comes in but yea it's just normal caravans after a workshop is built in the host city.  ,1,0,1444700482,1444727230
cvu5ae3,1,t3_3o567h,Jas9191,"Most importantly he has to answer the question very directly then expand the talk on the subject.  He normally does this but on certain topics, especially foreign policy, he really does the politician's bait and switch and ends up talking about his platform.   I just want to see him be direct.  Once people hear about Sanders and look him up they will vote for him.  This debate is his to lose.",5,0,1444424884,1444727230
cvtnde7,1,t3_3o1pil,Jas9191,"Remind her she's doing women a disservice by voting for Hillary solely on the basis of her being a woman.  Same as African Americans voting in Obama because he was black. Women are as capable and competent as men are and the first female president should earn it on merit not on gender.  Hillary and the party feel it is ""Hillarys turn.""",1,0,1444397017,1444727230
cvs6itu,0,t1_cvs5r8x,Jas9191,LOL did you take someones city?  Yes spam some military and get through the war.  It will cost you some turns but not a city.  Good luck,2,0,1444280131,1444727230

cvs2plu,0,t1_cvru138,Jas9191,Build up at least one unit per settled city.  You don't necessarily have to keep them spread like that but you need to up your military power in general for the AI to not attack you.,1,0,1444272062,1444727230

cvr73ww,0,t1_cvquq4s,Jas9191,Okay hopefully the game seems a bit less intimidating after a full game.  If you're looking for focus strategies you can basically use anyone you'd like and you really won't know if you'll enjoy them until you do.  I haven't played half the civs that come with the game and expansions and I'm always pleasantly surprised how much I like most civs and strategies.  What you'll want to do is focus on your civs strong points and snowball them exponentially.  For example as Babylon you'll want to pump out that first scientist and focus on science all the way up to public schools (and beyond) this will give you a huge science lead.   As incas you'll want to found cities near mountains and hills and build wonders and buildings that focus on growth.  Everything is about focus.  As Babylon or Korea you don't need to build cultural wonders and shouldn't waste your time on them.  Another thing is upping your difficulty.  This will force you not to make bad habits that the easier difficulties allow you to.  If you want any specific advice I'm more than happy to help but this game is waaaaaaaaaay to big to explain.  Even at 1000 hours I learn something new a couple times a game.  ,1,0,1444221867,1444727230

cvqkxus,0,t1_cvqkmqg,Jas9191,"I find the wars go very quick on defense and very slow on offense!  Keep up that defense and since he's actually invading keep on building units and defensive buildings.  Eventually Egypt will give you EVERYTHING to make peace.  Like 300gpt, luxuries, strategic resources everything.  You collect that for 15 turns or so while you build up for a counter and then you win :)  Good luck!",2,0,1444167713,1444727230
