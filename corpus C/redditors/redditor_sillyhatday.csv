cvxwoce,1,t3_3ojxk2,sillyhatday,"The left coalition is quite stable at the moment. There is a general consensus around center-left progressive politics. The biggest difference of opinion I notice is that Liberals are more irritated about the security state than progressives and centrists are, but it's not a huge issue of debater right now. It would seem there is even broad agreement that income inequality is the next battle to fight. It's kind of unusual, but yes, I would say the left is much more united than the right at this moment in time. ",1,1,1444718858,1444719503
cvx2vrb,1,t3_3ogica,sillyhatday,"Manning's decline is a beautiful thing to watch, but frustrating in that the Broncos have fluked their way to 4-0 anyway, while the Chiefs, who were supposed to be the heir apparent in the division, are suddenly the worst team in the NFL.",-14,0,1444669167,1444719503
cvx2ngd,1,t3_3ofz7e,sillyhatday,"Atheists split here regarding spirituality, but I personally am devoid of any spiritual nature. For those like me, if you job is solely spiritual/religious support, then I don't think you have a role to play. If you can act as just a counselor without a spiritual dimension, that's your route. If so, I'd probably even introduce yourself as such. I know that when I've been hospitalized, if a chaplain came to talk to me I probably would have rejected him outright. I might have heard a counselor. ",4,0,1444668819,1444719503
cvx0ej6,1,t3_3oe367,sillyhatday,"As someone who thinks most elections are relatively predictable based on metrics, the metrics would pick Obama easy. Metrics that predict reelection:

46%+ approval: Check(on average)

Growth rate 1%+: Check

Unemployment low and stable or high but falling: Check

No major scandals: Check

The president would be a pretty routine incumbent's advantage pick for reelection.

cvwzxeg,1,t3_3ogkll,sillyhatday,"As a liberal, My disagreements with conservatives about economics feel technical and dispassionate. But on matters like gay marriage, I look at them with disgust at how they could possibly think they're remotely in the right to think about their fellow human beings that way. It pisses me off.

I think that abortion is like that for conservatives. If you genuinely think life begins at conception, then pro-choice is support of murdering babies. I can genuinely see a pro-life person finding themselves in an angry dismay that someone can possibly support abolition rights. ",54,0,1444664522,1444719503
cvve0ht,1,t3_3o9x3g,sillyhatday,"A connection of man to the natural world that bore him, even if bound in woo, is better than submission to the intergalactic tyrant. ",2,0,1444528551,1444719503
cvsk2lz,1,t3_3ny499,sillyhatday,"If you try to extract an actual point from what Deepak said, he's essentially saying there are strange observations at the quantum level, which are explained by god, woo, whatever. Locality vs potentiality gets very hard to pin down with subatomic particles. To cite that as evidence for god is the ''god of the gaps'' argument.   God, then, is ignorance, and I suppose I can agree to that. ",12,0,1444318039,1444719503
cvs8i0s,1,t3_3nw8j2,sillyhatday,"Cruz. Not that I think it's going to happen, but he's a sneaky good politician. He can say bat shit, red meat, dog whistle stuff all day, but make it sound intellectual. ",0,0,1444285730,1444719503
cvp7uqd,1,t3_3nkuyg,sillyhatday,"I like FPTP as long as there are two candidates. I would use a jungle primary to produce the final two. France does this in a system called ''two rounds.'' While it would work normally in congressional races, I concede it would be hard to implement in our presidential election system because of how long it already is.",1,0,1444072252,1444719503
