You're just straight up a weird person.",4,0,1444657529,1444729144

Ah the machines at my Tescos always accept your card without you having to press the button.

I guess some of them have much better software than others.",3,0,1444572302,1444729144
cvv2wd1,1,t3_3o83t1,fade_like_a_sigh,"> It's yet another hurdle you have to jump over at the self-service machines, which are already difficult enough to use as it is.

Who are all these people who are struggling to use self-service checkouts? It honestly baffles me that people can't operate such a basic machine without needing constant assistance.

When they first arrived the weight sensors were admittedly a little zealous in thinking an unexpected item was in the bagging area, but it's been years since then and they work perfectly 100% of the time for me.",12,0,1444507738,1444729144
cvu2p6y,0,t1_cvttd88,fade_like_a_sigh,"Isn't this exactly what cults do? They target those who are feeling down and depressed and promise them eternal happiness and a community they can thrive in.

Those who fall for it would be considered naive and if they started preaching about the cult to others they'd be considered brainwashed. If they spoke to others who were depressed, it would definitely be considered taking advantage of people.

Just because Christianity is far far bigger than your standard cult, that shouldn't change anything when the behaviour is almost identical.",0,0,1444420840,1444729144
cvtx99c,1,t3_3o4982,fade_like_a_sigh,"More side quests do indeed open up at either 47 or 48, possibly both. I believe they start from The Waking Sands which nobody checks.

A lot of players don't even know those quests exist. There may still be a bit of grinding involved in 46-50 but it definitely alleviates some of it.",4,0,1444412688,1444729144

He said he personally finds women mystifying. That's pretty common, in the same way a lot of women find things men do unexplainable. He mentioned nothing remotely to do with women in science.

He gave a genuine answer, albeit a humorous one.",5,0,1444307950,1444729144

It's a demonstration that really drives home the immense danger of grease fires if not handled correctly.",3,0,1444237838,1444729144
cvr8g91,0,t1_cvr8704,fade_like_a_sigh,"Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime has gone down really well with the people I've played it with so far.

The difficulty picks up pretty fast so it does need good coordination and communication at a point, but those are good things to develop anyway when playing games with your friends.

Very fun and there's no other game I've played that's quite like it. Bonus points for couch co-op on PC.",2,0,1444224805,1444729144
cvqjdkd,0,t1_cvqiiwg,fade_like_a_sigh,"> They can't really hide behind religion when they're ignoring huge parts of it.

By that logic, there are no true Christians since they all overlook plenty of the rules from the Bible.

Religion is not so easily defined as total adherence to the holy doctrine.

The beliefs of ISIS are religiously motivated. I mean heck, even the name is ""Islamic State"".",126,0,1444165299,1444729144
