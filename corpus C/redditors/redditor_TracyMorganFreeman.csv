So is producing electric cars. Lithium and nickel are harmful in many ways.

>Is it really so crazy to want to treat them different when they are developing products actually viable for the future?

If they are viable for the future there's already an incentive. 

The key is internalizing the externality of pollution. Incentivizing electric cars is messing with the wrong side of the equation because it's not a case of zero pollution or all. There are tradeoffs for the cost of using each. The pollution is a distortion to that cost, but the solution isn't adding another compensatory distortion which likely won't reflect the original distortion.

As for luxury cars it just seems a social engineering thing, wanting to punish wealth because artificially making things appear more equal is politically sexy.",0,0,1444688050,1444722267
