cvxmxem,1,t3_3ohwcd,inthedarkbluelight,"I don't think that s guy who can be shot to death can possibly beat the Avengers. Maybe some of them but certainly not Thor and Hulk, and provably none of them when they are fighting together.

Also, how tough are Atheon, Crota, and Oryx if one guy can beat them? They are all rigged with stupid mechanics and if they were not no one would be able to kill them without numbers.

Round 1: Titan probably kills Blackwidow, she's got no armor.

Hawkeye will be a tougher fight, especially at range, the guy doesn't miss and he's got exploding arrows. 

Captain America is surprisingly good at fighting more powerful opponents, but the Titan is no pushover, 50/50.

Ironman is a big problem for the Titan, he can fly, he's covered in weapons, stronger, ect. Ironman probably stomps. 

Thor can't really lose this fight, considering that any Titan who fought through half the Avengers is surd to be dinged up pretty bad.

Hulk would tear the Titan apart even if he was fully healed and had all his super up.

Round 2: Titan loses.

Round 3: Still losses, might get a kill or two if he's lucky.  ",1,0,1444699309,1444725149

cvx79jf,1,t3_3oetmu,inthedarkbluelight,"Ok, because Punisher has infinite prep time I'm assuming he will also be able picking when and where to engage. And considering Batman is dead I imagine Batman's rogues will be running wild in Gotham. Overall I think the smart villains will be the biggest threat to Frank.

Bane: Frank would know not to get in close quarters with this guy, so he would kill him with a high powered rifle, missile, or planted explosives when Bane least expects it.

Blackmask: Frank eats guys like this for breakfast.

Calendarman: Frank will have trouble predicting this guys moves. I figure at some point he might commit a crime and that Frank will take notice of. I don't think Frank can outsmart this guy, it's possible he could get Frank with a trap, but if Frank actually crosses paths with him it will be over.

Catwoman: I don't think Frank would target Catwoman. She just steals stuff so I think he would ignore her in favor of other targets.

Clayface: Considering that Clayface can look like anyone Frank will have difficulty locating him. Frank's could engage Clayface with heavy firepower during a crime in progress, but it would be a risky fight. Frank has been known to scavenge equipment from fallen enemies, so he might need to gear up before going after Clayface.

Cluemaster: Frank probably won't figure out any of the clues this guy leaves, knowing this he would go after the guys daughter and use her to find him, then it's game over.

Deadshot: I don't think Frank can beat this guy in a stand up fight. If Frank can acquire the funds he might hire deadshot to kill off some of the brainy villains and hope that Deadshot fulfills his deathwish. If it comes down to it Frank will have to lure this guy into a trap to kill him.

Deathstroke: Frank can't beat this guy.

Firefly: Heatseeking missle.

Harley Quinn: Sad to say but Harley doesn't have a chance.

Hugo Strange: Frank can't outsmart Hugo so he won't be able to engage him on his own terms. If Frank starts meddling with Hugo he will probably fall into a trap.

Hush: A formidable opponent for Frank but I think he will be caught off guard by the Punisher's seasoned brutality. 

Joker: Joker is eventually going to engage in some very public, theatrical madness. Headshot.

Killer Croc: Another set up kill. Frank will find him and take him out from a distance.

Killer Moth: Frank just shoots him in the face.

Mad Hatter: Frank shoots him and takes his mind control hats.

Man-Bat: Frank plays loud music and hits him with automatic weapons and explosives. It's a tough fight but Frank wins.

Mr. Freeze: Bullets, napalm, now Frank has a freeze gun.

Penguin: No match for Frank.

Poison Ivy: Frank kills her from a distance or napalm.

Ra's Al Ghul: Even if Frank ever finds out where to find Ra's he will still lose.

Riddler: Frank never catches the Riddler. Maybe the Riddler eventually gets bored and either kills Frank with a trap or gets sloppy and ends up dead.

Scarecrow: Frank wears a gas mask and kills him no problem, then steals fear gas.

Solomon Grundy: Too powerful for Frank to kill with conventional weapons. Frank might be able to win using fear gas and the freeze gun.

Two-Face: Probably the first on to die. Frank uses the special coin to do laundry the next day.

Ventriloquist: No match for Frank.

Victor Zsasz: It will be a bloody showdown but Victor's lack of advanced weaponry will give Frank the edge he needs to win.
