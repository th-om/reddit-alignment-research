We need to change the way toys are marketed to children. We need to make kids media less gendered and remove the stereotypes. We need to change how occupations are portrayed in the media. We need to encourage kids to pursue ""nonstandard"" professions for their race/gender from day one.

You're just removing tools from yourself.

Again- the side bar is *right there* for your education, if you were actually interested in learning.

I wonder what your next conspiracy theory will be when you're grown out of your I-hate-feminism phase. If you don't learn to think critically you're doomed to another obsession when this one starts to bore you.

Bad sources *will* make you stupider. 

Here's a post I just wrote: not that you'll internalize it, that would require more self-awareness and humility than you have at this point in your life, but for the lurkers following this inane conversation.

I cannot stress enough the importance of good sources.

We live in an age where information is easily accessible to anyone. But what of it's quality? If you don't learn and take it upon yourself to vet the quality if the sources you read, you *will* be stupider, despite reading more.

Glad you came here to check. 

But think about it. Anyone can post anything and you will read it without knowing who the poster was, what the intentions were, how much they know, what their experiences is, what their degree is, how respected they are in the community, etc etc etc

And this, in a nutshell, is why despite hours and days and weeks and months of reading on the internet, those in the MRM make themselves stupider.

What a colossal waste of time and brain power. 

*why are you wasting your time on that website!!!!!*

Life is too short for that garbage.
