cvvsyb0,1,t3_3obous,noprotein,"Your mind truly can make a differentiation, you just aren't acknowledging it. Perhaps willfully, perhaps uncontrollably. Try to pick times to browse certain things or separate the activities. Comes down to a bit of discipline. If you're reading so much, read on this very thing you're asking about: prioritization among adhd people. Good luck, it's not hopeless, but don't give in to feeding this behavior because it's only you who can improve the situation.",5,0,1444573111,1444723446
