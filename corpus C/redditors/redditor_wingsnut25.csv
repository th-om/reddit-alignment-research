A more common scenario would be for someone to have a handgun as backup weapon. For example you shoot a bear with your rifle and it is now charging at you.  Having the handgun available could possibly save your life.

The reason I am troubled is that they have provided an almost clearcut
case of methodologically sound research in support of something
I have theoretically opposed for years, namely, the use of a gun in
defense against a criminal perpetrator. Maybe Franklin Zimring and
Philip Cook can help me find fault with the Kleck and Gertz research,
but for now, I have to admit my admiration for the care and caution
expressed in this article and this research.
Can it be true that about two million instances occur each year in
which a gun was used as a defensive measure against crime? It is hard
to believe. Yet, it is hard to challenge the data collected. ""



The peer that you are referring to is David Hemenway.  Who by the way was part of a separate study conducted by the National Institute of Justice which estimated 2.45 million Defensive Gun Uses per year.  Hemenway doesn't like to talk about that study though.

If you would like a good rebuttale to Hemenways claims read: [Getting the DGU Estimate Down] (http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6937&context=jclc)

""Hemenway has failed to cast even mild doubt on the accuracy of
our estimates. The claim that there are huge numbers of defensive
uses of guns each year in the United States has been repeatedly confirmed,
and remains one of the most consistently supported assertions
in the guns-violence research area. Given H's purposes, however, it is
politically inconsequential that we can easily rebut all of his claims.
We can be confident that ideologues will cite his series of one-sided
speculations as authoritative proof that our estimates have been ""discredited,""
while pro-control academics who fancy themselves moderates
will conclude that although maybe H was wrong on some points,
he has nevertheless somehow ""cast doubt"" on the estimates or ""raised
serious questions"" about them. Left unmentioned wl be one simple
fact: In all of H's commentary, he does not once cite the one thing
that could legitimately cast doubt on our estimates-better empirical
evidence.""",1,0,1444227242,1444719689

[Full Source](http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6937&context=jclc)

""It is hard to discern exactly what kinds of false positives H thinks
most often show up in all these gun use surveys. He waffles on the
issue of whether people are: (1) consciously inventing nonexistent
events; (2) consciously but honestly misrepresenting accounts of real
events that did not really involve DGU (e.g., they involved aggressive
use of a gun); or (3) unconsciously distorting real events. He seems to
have doubts himself about possibility (1) occurring very often, hastening
to assure readers that false responders do not necessarily have to
lie,15 but is otherwise unwilling to commit himself to the relative frequency
of these types of misreports.
It is worth emphasizing how difficult it was for our Rs to falsely
report a completely nonexistent event as a DGU. Unlike the UFO
example that H insists is somehow parallel to reports of DGUs,16 a
respondent who wanted to falsely report a nonexistent DGU could not
qualify as having had such an experience merely by saying 'Yes.""
Rather, respondents had to provide as many as nineteen internally
consistent responses covering the details of the alleged incident. In short, to sustain a false DGU claim, Rs had to do a good deal of agile
mental work, and stay on the phone even longer. On the other hand,
all it took to yield a false negative was for a DGU-involved R to speak a
single inaccurate syllable: ""No."" The point is not that false positives
were impossible, but rather that it was far harder to provide a false
positive than a false negative.
Consider also the context in which H imagines all these false reports
to have occurred. Randomly selected people were called unexpectedly,
and questioned rapidly by total strangers, for no more than
fifteen minutes, with one question immediately following another.
There was no prolonged opportunity to invent a nonexistent event,
rehearse inaccurate details, or to otherwise get an false story straight.
Rs providing a false positive had to be not only dishonest but very
quick-witted as well""

Kleck's methodology was actually praised by many other criminologist.  Even those who are anti-gun.    Check out [A Tribute to a View I have Opposed](http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6854&context=jclc)  by famed Criminologist Marvin Wolfgang

The majority of the criticisms come from David Hemenway.   Interestingly enough Hemenway was part of a separate study that came to similar conclusions as Kleck.  But Hemenway doesn't like to talk about that study because it didn't fit his agenda.",0,0,1444225609,1444719689

One possibility: I think it was trying to be attached to a bill about water but I am not positive. It's possible they might have said this has no business being attached to this.  However if it was something they really really wanted, I am pretty sure it would not have stopped them.   Also if it was something they really wanted, but did not want it attached to something else they could have co-sponsored it in a separate bill, however they did not.

Another possibility:  It didn't go far enough.  It wasn't what they really wanted.  So they didn't want to support it.
