cvwxyz8,0,t1_cvwxlvy,nolan1971,"You know... haha, of course. Still, Google's emphatic insistence on ""Don't be Evil"", and the marketing spin put on about it, has always made me really suspicious.

Anyway, Google is just a [subsidiary to Alphabet](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/new-company-called-alphabet-owns-google/) now regardless. Google can therefore easily be nice and ""Not Evil"", but I have yet to see any marketing about Alphabet following in those footsteps.",37,0,1444661179,1444719224
cvwxj7z,0,t1_cvww0nq,nolan1971,"Their isn't an absolute ""now"", but then their isn't an absolute *anything*. I didn't read what /u/IAmAPhysicsGuy said as stating that their was an absolute now, though. As a matter of fact, he specifically said that their were different ""now's"".

The thing is, it's sort of academic. Reality within a frame of reference is absolute... information received by observers within that frame of reference has *happened*, and propagating the event outward from that frame is limited by *c* regardless of the means used (as far as we know, at least).",4,0,1444660385,1444719224
