cvxrbuv,0,t1_cvx7bzl,Darkmoth,"Do you remember the Clinton vs Obama supporter hate? ""PUMA""s? Whoooo. Yet we came together.

For the record I really thought I hated Clinton supporters for a while.",1,1,1444706206,1444717075
cvxr8s0,1,t3_3ohdmd,Darkmoth,"""No Muslim should be President"" is a disqualifying belief, in my book. I would feel the same about a candidate that said no Christian should be President.",1,1,1444706066,1444717075
cvxqyk3,1,t3_3oj0uq,Darkmoth,"Seriously? Noooo. Not in a million years. After Hillary, I like Bernie far more than any of the GOP field.

If both Hillary AND Sanders were somehow knocked out, I'd vote Trump. But it would be a ""middle finger"" vote.",1,1,1444705612,1444717075
cvxqjrp,0,t1_cvxpuwk,Darkmoth,"I think you've nailed it exactly. Clinton will be debating with an eye towards minimizing the ire of Sander supporters, who she may eventually need. It's going to be a love fest.

The wild card is how much the moderators want to turn it into a cage match.",1,1,1444704944,1444717075
cvxqewc,0,t1_cvx54s2,Darkmoth,"> The contemporary left doesn't see a problem with bias, they think bias is inevitable so they want to be biased in a way that is most effective

One might argue that this is also the media strategy of the contemporary right - ""counterbalancing"" liberal bias.",1,1,1444704734,1444717075

cvxq46l,0,t1_cvxphs2,Darkmoth,"It's part of the meme. It's like how people say ""she comes off as shady and aloof"", while [2014 Gallup polling](http://www.gallup.com/poll/180365/barack-obama-hillary-clinton-extend-run-admired.aspx) puts her as the Most Admired Woman in the World for the last *thirteen* years.

Talking points repeated enough times becomes truth.",1,1,1444704242,1444717075
cvxpsu4,1,t3_3oiw2c,Darkmoth,"Fun/Weird Hillary fact: In 2014 a [Gallup poll of Americans](http://www.gallup.com/poll/180365/barack-obama-hillary-clinton-extend-run-admired.aspx) named her ""Most Admired Woman in the World"". Oprah was 2nd, Malala was 3rd.

She was also Most Admired in 2013. And 2012. And 2011. In fact, for the last 13 polls she's won.

This is why I take the ""unlikable"" thing with a grain of salt. All the big guns are out for her, and they're having some effect. But outside the campaign, she does fine.",1,1,1444703737,1444717075
cvxp9i5,0,t1_cvxjyjd,Darkmoth,"Yeah, but if you read the article, the coverage sucks for her. Frankly, as a Clinton supporter I'd be happier if they didn't mention her til Election day.

This does not fit the narrative of the media favoring Clinton over Bernie. The media hits both of them where it hurts.",1,1,1444702919,1444717075
cvxp0x0,0,t1_cvwwvyx,Darkmoth,"I actually agree with much of that, but not the ""income disparity"" one. Keeping the economy from melting down AND reversing the slide towards plutocracy is a tall, even unreasonable order. I'm not sure any President can do that, it would take a national wave election (including governors and state legs).",1,1,1444702559,1444717075
