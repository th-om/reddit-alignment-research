cvoqmfs,1,t3_3nidcv,Charphin,"I think the important fact that if you worked it out in cm first then converted it to meters it wouldn't have seem so bad.

As 40cm*40cm =1600cm^2

Now as there are 100 cm in a meter then there are 10000cm^2 in a 1m^2.

That means that 1600cm^2 is equal to 0.16m^2.

or realistically you're forgetting this fact get a square object and cut of a corner by cutting from the center of the square to the edge so that it meet the 2 edges perpendicularly. You have cut those two edges in half but you have only removed 25%of the square. ",2,0,1444034256,1444731490

The other area is people at the bottom rarely have the money for saving or investments any money after short term expenses either goes on paying debts or making themselves feel ""human"" again (investing in their mental/emotional ""energy"" stores)which frankly is important as future financial investments. That not even talking about the people who have zero income/zero savings right now. ",2,0,1443132534,1444731490
cv1hcig,0,t1_cu2ovvz,Charphin,"This was my biggest problem with Labour in the past and why I have said I would never vote for them (will vote for Corbyn though, while I don't agree with all his policies, I can really get behind him) because instead of giving real policies it was Tories bad or that witch Thatcher.

Do you know who Thatcher is to me, an old senile lady who died after spending an afternoon watching cat videos on the Internet.

This demonisation of tories in the past doesn't work when a 29 year old like me (12 when Blair got in, the only prime minister I've really known excepting Cameron). While I have lived through an earlier Tory era don't really remember much about the politics of that time. ",1,0,1442259489,1444731490
cuukh7u,1,t3_3k3zvs,Charphin,"This is based on what I understand and I'm only a self studied basic level of economic understanding but it due to being at the bottom warps the market due to multiple effects.

1. being poor makes you dumber or more seriously being poor and in a survival situation puts a tax on your mental faculties making question beyond how you're going to survive the next problem harder to deal with. 

2. How much would you pay for a glass of water today? what about if you were dying of thirst? When you're close to the edge you take the first deal offered even if it is not the best. mostly due to marginal utility being weird for necessity when they are near to survival levels. Which translates directly to taking the first job you find even if it doesn't really pays enough just so you cover the bills in front of you.

3. No equals in negotiations. a business is not the same a person even a small mom and pop store have a better bargaining position than most of their employees.

4. People are not taught economics and don't realise how trade works. They forget their labor has a minimum profitable price per week like all products. 

5. Undercutting by people who have less than ""normal""/average cost of living. This is not necessary Illegal immigrants but can also be living with parents teen labor. 

.

Now I have no idea how large effect each of those has or even if they even have an effective effect but I also suspect that this list is incomplete so take it with a pinch of salt.",8,0,1441730834,1444731490

Not completely serious but business wise remember tax wise companies trading in the EU have to pay VAT on location of purchaser so you might be able to set up an online business to a few online sales to the  the UK and claim business in the UK. 

Yeah there probably wasn't a charge and even if it was most places don't really care as it would be cheaper to forgive the debt then collect it. Also most hospitals administration staff don't know how to claim the money or that they are meant to in most cases. ",1,0,1435230576,1444731490
