cuue5um,0,t1_cuu3yb7,AlecBergHouseman,"Just saying ""The FEC"" is not actually sourcing your claim. Where did they release these statistics? Based on the laws governing donations to SuperPACs, I contend there is no way to actually break down the percentages in the manner you proposed. 

The second part of your response, forgive me, doesn't make much sense. I just don't quite understand you are trying to say or what point you're trying to make.

Please focus on the initial question I asked: How can you get a percentage breakdown like you claimed when SuperPACs are not required to disclose their donors?

Where do you get these statistics? 

> Do super PACs have to disclose the sources of their funding?
That depends on what you mean by ""disclose."" Like other political action committees, super PACs do have to file regular financial disclosure forms with the Federal Election Commission. But because they are permitted to accept money from incorporated entities that do not have to make the sources of their funding public, it's possible for them to keep the names of actual donors undisclosed. In 2010, a super PAC that was active in one of that year's marquee House races listed a single donor: a 501(c)(4) organization that does not have to disclose its donors. This is what is known among some campaign finance lawyers as ""the Russian doll problem.""
