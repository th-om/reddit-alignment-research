cvwlqz5,1,t3_3oeg7e,tquill,"Organization is a trade off between guaranteed time spent now... vs the possibility of spending a bit more time in the future. 

In other words, you have two options. 

1. Spend a lot of time now with a possibly complicated and time consuming organizational system that you might need in the future. 

2. Spend a little time now with a basic organizational system that would take more time in the the future... Should you need to find something. 

I used to aim for #1...  But now I use the second option because no matter how organized my first option was...  I still go through everything when I need it just in case... So spending a lot of time up front didn't help too much. 

Sorry,  I know it's an overly complicated answer to your question, but I think it's important to understand the reality of how you'll use your organization. 

Anyway, I have a filing cabinet with labeled hanging folders and I just throw stuff in there.  If it gets too full, I'll empty it out the oldest stuff and scan it into my computer. ",2,0,1444623244,1444720855

cvuqcla,0,t1_cvuj1p9,tquill,"How is hypocritical?  The first sentence is referring to a percentage of income, while the 3rd bullet point is referring to the loan interest rate. ",1,0,1444482089,1444720855
cvu09p7,0,t1_cvtz2pw,tquill,"It's not really a percentage that matters in my view.  I always try to minimize expenses to maximize debt service / saving for retirement.  If my salary increased today... I wouldn't base my retirement savings on a percentage of my income, and just spend the rest.

For example, suppose my wife and I live on about $3k a month. If my salary went from a hypothetical $4k to $5k... I would still spend the same $3k a month on living... and the $1k raise would go entirely into my retirement.  You shouldn't spend more, simply because you make more.  

Obviously, you could stand to spend a bit more on yourself... but I personally wouldn't get in the habit of spending a large portion of any raises on anything but retirement or debt service.  Doing so is the definition of lifestyle inflation, and it's why many highly paid individuals still live paycheck to paycheck.

Anyway, in my view, an order of priority would be this:

1. Max out any 401k match from your employer.
2. Have 3 months' expenses in savings as emergency fund.
3. Pay off any student loans with an interest rate of 4% or higher.
4. Max out Roth IRA and invest in Vanguard target retirement date fund.
5. Pay off any remaining students loans.
6. Increase emergency fund from step 2 to 6 months' expenses.
7. Max out 401k contributions.

It's important to remember that it's never a bad option to pay down debt... but depending on the interest rate, you can get more from your money in the long run if you invest.  The generally accepted interest rate where investing is ""better"" than paying down debt is 4%.",2,0,1444417168,1444720855

cvtyiz3,1,t3_3o4n2t,tquill,"Assuming you have an appropriately-sized emergency fund and you're maxing out any 401k company match... I would put as much as possible towards the student debt.  You'll have to pay it all eventually... you might as well avoid as much interest as you can.

If you had lower interest rates, an argument could be made for contributing to your IRA instead... but at 6%, it's probably best to just knock out your debt.",2,0,1444414584,1444720855
