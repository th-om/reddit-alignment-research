cvqnj9u,0,t1_cvqgc62,travelling_anth,"The problem with charity is that very often, it is attached to a religious message. Folks that are down on their luck and are in need of charity should be put into a situation in which they are subject to the messages of the followers of religion A, B or C. 

Charity is awesome, but depending on the kindness of your fellow man to dole out as much to charity as gets automatically taken out by taxes to do the same job i believe is a great way to screw over those less fortunate. The times man is most charitable to mankind are in times of dire need and tragedy. And even then, the attention span to give continuously is just not there. ",1,0,1444172000,1444720699
cvqn9l2,0,t1_cvqh6e8,travelling_anth,"Remarkably the cartoon doesn't show the guy in blue also going into his own pocket. I realize that this is satire, but it kinda irks me that socialist ideals are shown as ""here, let me give you the money out of this guy's pocket"" rather than the actual reality of ""here, this is money from the collective pool gathered by the entire community..."" The cartoon does a wonderful job of vilifying a concept by simply removing a key component. But that is issue with political cartoons. An oversimplification of an idea slanted to the artist's bias.

cvqdnnt,1,t3_3nqiwz,travelling_anth,I wonder what Orlando City will have to give up to pry Alex Morgan from Portland. The marketing side alone is worth a pretty penny. Maybe if we organized a three way trade with Washington to get Crystal Dunn???,15,0,1444156984,1444720699

No snark...i am looking for clarification. ",1,0,1443817420,1444720699

cvjkml1,1,t3_3mzsq9,travelling_anth,"I don't think it is hypocritical because the overt reasoning is different. 

Toppling of Saddam in 2003 was done under the guise of terrorism linked to 9/11 and the threat of WMDs. If the reasoning was the fact that he was using chemical weapons against the Kurds and Obama was against it, then yes, it would be hypocritical. Alas, A primary reason for the removal of Assad is his use of chemical weapons against the rebels. ",4,0,1443637856,1444720699
