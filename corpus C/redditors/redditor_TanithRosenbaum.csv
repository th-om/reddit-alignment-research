So be it, it's their body. But what I fear is that other people see such recklessness, and think it actually is okay and safe. That's what worries me quite a bit.",2,0,1444576750,1444729192

cvtkfwi,1,t3_3o19dz,TanithRosenbaum,"Steam locomotives are still used in regular service in Europe, mostly with smaller narrow-gauge railways that have tourist appeal (Mind, those aren't heritage railways though). But I assume you mean on main lines. 

The last regular service use of a steam locomotive in passenger Service in Germany (and likely in Europe) was on 6 November 1994. Engine 52 8134 ran a service from Berlin/Lichtenberg to Rheinsberg/Mark and back. See [this](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letzte_regul%C3%A4re_Eins%C3%A4tze_von_Dampflokomotiven) for further information.

However, after opening the European railway network to private railway companies, some of which do own steam locomotives, they are used occasionally in one-off revenue services when they're in the right place at the right time, so to speak. For instance, 50 3610 ran a number of cargo trains between Horka and Hoyerswerda in the Summer of 2010.

The last operative non-museum steam engine owned by a state-owned railway in Europe is 52 3501, owned by the [Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiningen_Steam_Locomotive_Works), which is owned by DB, the German Railways.",2,0,1444389260,1444729192
