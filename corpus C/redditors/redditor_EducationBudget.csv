English, unlike Chinese or Cherokee, has an enormous number of possible syllables and new sounds are often formed (like twerk, grok, etc) that have never been used in print before.

cvcvdey,0,t1_cvc061m,EducationBudget,"This is extremely reasonable. I'm sure you already know about the counterproductive ways in which eligibility for social programs is calculated. For the most part, under x you get something, over x you get nothing. Without a gradient, a lot of people end up stuck taking in welfare and other services because their quality of life would go *down* if they got a job. 

It's infuriating. Just simplifying the qualification system and consolidating services would allow people to get to work faster, make more efficient use of resources, and increase the quality of those social resources. It was only when UBI was presented to me this way that I truly understood its utility. ",1,0,1443120988,1444724656
cvcujbd,0,t1_cvcu426,EducationBudget,"That's a very difficult question. I'm of the opinion, though, that when it comes to driving demand (like demand for housing) it's best to let markets set prices rather than try to manipulate lending standards so that the same asset can be bought by someone who would not be able to afford it without government intervention. Clearly, that has a strong distortionary effect.

If you look at housing prices (before the government's interventions to expand home ownership) adjusted for inflation, they went up ~0-2% per year for ~100 years. Only when government started to interfere did the prices go crazy.

There may have been issues that led to those policies, but I very much doubt that any data suggests that the government was capable of engineering a *better* system. ",2,0,1443119752,1444724656
cvctozi,0,t1_cvct6i3,EducationBudget,"There is compelling evidence that government engineering of the housing market led to the bubble in the first place. Government programs led to an expansion of credit to many people that shouldn't have had it. Both parties fetishized home ownership and messed with the free market to get more of it. You can do some research of your own on this, but you can't blame Wall Street for playing by the new, worse rules that the government introduced. See the CRA, for one. Also, Bill Clinton's repeal of Glass-Steagel was horrifyingly irresponsible and led to a number of perverse incentives. 

There is plenty of blame to go around, but if governments subsidize bad behavior, ""capitalism"" is not to blame, since that's not capitalism. ",1,0,1443118499,1444724656

cvbui3a,0,t1_cvbohkj,EducationBudget,"You are obviously high on some kind of drug or you don't understand what a commodity is. That's fine, I wouldn't someone so opinionated to have any understanding of economics or reality. You are here to soapbox with your uninformed opinions and not have a discussion. 

You also have a victim complex because the only *opinion* of yours with which I had a problem was the one that governments should take the difference between old and new prices. Consumers would still get screwed. What you want, though you're too incoherent to rub those two brain cells of yours together, is a limit on how high a company can raise the price of its drugs. 

It's a shame - I have the same opinion as you apparently do. But you are so eager to chew out anyone who questions even a single aspect of your nonsensical babbling that you will never win anyone over to your side, even if so down, somewhere in your schizophrenic mind, there is a good idea. You really need to take a Valium and calm down. 

Also, there is now, and will always be, more than one producer of grain, bread, whatever. X competes with Y. Collusion is illegal, as always. If X raises its price 500 times, X will sell no grain. Y will sell all of his grain. X will make no money. He will be forced to lower his price to the market rate or he will make no money. This is not a difficult thought experiment.

cvbkksb,0,t1_cvbkgfs,EducationBudget,"You just started talking about something completely different. The forest thing you said was that government should benefit from price-gouging (perhaps to discourage the behavior). Here, you're using a totally different example that has nothing to do with government, which has to do with the morality of stealing under extreme circumstances. 

Are you proposing that governments put a limit on how much drug prices can go up in one year? You're really all over the place and your second comment sends even less coherent than the first. 

Also, your bread example, while a valid ethical question, is a poor choice of good for your example since bread is a commodity that anyone can produce (price-gouging is practically impossible) whereas proprietary medicines cannot be undercut because only one company can produce them.
