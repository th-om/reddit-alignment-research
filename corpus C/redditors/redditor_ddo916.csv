Next, I'd audit everyone who receives government assistance. If I find that they have other income (I.e. off the books earnings) they lose their assistance and are assessed a penalty.",-1,0,1444332792,1444724764

cvf61du,1,t3_3micep,ddo916,"George Pataki. 

Very moderate Republican who understands the scope of his power. When he was Governor of my state, he didn't seek out national limelight. Rather, he focused on doing his job: administrating the New York State Government. You won't see him commenting on matters that don't pertain to the Presidency. After 9/11, he could've easily claimed the spotlight, as Giuliani did, but, again, he  chose to just do his job and guide the state through example, rather than through rhetoric.

Pataki doesn't pander. He's vocal about his support of things like abortion rights, LGBT rights, and climate change. This tells me that he is an honest candidate who has built a platform based on *his* views (not the views of donors) and isn't willing to compromise it. What you see is what you get. As such, I expect that he would be extremely effective at working with both Republicans and Democrats, because, not only did he do so in NY, but he also won't be under the influence of any establishment base.",5,0,1443302625,1444724764
