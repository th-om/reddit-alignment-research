Government does not force the religious, of any religion, to directly support something they're against. The balance is not putting religious laws that not everyone agrees with into public laws. It's important that government both at the national level and local level be considered.

So then, no actions taken on bakers refusing to do gay wedding services?


> Also another question: Would you be comfortable definitively stating, without question or doubt, that voter ID laws are not meant to discourage or suppress LEGITIMATE Democrat Party voters (whatever their ethnic group or beliefs)? 

It doesn't in all the other countries that use it to limit voter fraud.

>What do you think of poll taxes 

Normally, I would be against that. But with the likes of Bernie offering to rob the taxpayer to buy votes from many of those not working, it may be appropriate. We are now becoming a nation of takers with fewer and fewer makers.

BROKEN WINDOW FALLACY.

What part about making things more expensive means less people can afford them is it you do not understand?

Yeah, Bernie is unlikely to stop spending by printing and debt.

cvkm6l4,0,t1_cvklo6j,ItsAlivee,">here is how bernie sanders plans on getting jobs back to america

Let's look at those points...

  * Rebuilding Our Crumbling Infrastructure

That's going to take from capitol. It's going to take from the taxpayers. Which will make them poorer. That's not a climate entrepreneurs look for.

  * Reversing Climate Change

As in, make things more expensive. Yeah, that will only make things worse.


  * Creating Worker Co-ops

Probably by robbing the taxpayers in order to set them up. Again, that robs the economy.

  * Growing the Trade Union Movement

Yeah, unions, closed shops, are not job creators. They also make labor more expensive. More expensive things means less people can afford them.

  * Raising the Minimum Wage

Making labor more expensive means fewer people can afford the labor. That's not going to help, by locking out more people from the jobs market. 

  * Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers

More than likely he will start a trade war and more jobs will be lost when we export less.

  * Making College Affordable for All

Probably by making the working class pay for it and therefore taking more spending money from them. 

  * Health Care as a Right for All

Yeah, more free stuff for those that do not work paid for by those that do.

  * Protecting the Most Vulnerable Americans

Again, lighter wallets for the middle class.


  * Real Tax Reform

Yeah, higher taxes to pay for everything he wants to give to those not working.",-7,0,1443715863,1444721547
