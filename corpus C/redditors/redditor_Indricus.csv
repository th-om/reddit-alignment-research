cvle983,0,t1_cvl71c7,Indricus,Every single politician who says 'this is a Christian nation' when trying to justify their position on an issue is implicitly trying to do just exactly that. ,3,0,1443761144,1444721046
cvkxqep,0,t1_cvkw3ed,Indricus,Care to explain that? Are you trying to imply that some party *is* attempting to institute an Islamic theocracy in the US? Because that's even crazier than claiming that 9/11 was a conspiracy to destroy proof that the moon landings were faked. ,1,0,1443732351,1444721046
cvkvzwq,0,t1_cvkrr3m,Indricus,"Yes, there are black charities. But there are disproportionately more blacks in need, and fewer with the resources to donate, resulting in less money having to stretch much further. Similarly, there *are* non-government resources for homeless trans youth and such, but those resources are stretched exceedingly thin and could never hope to meet the need, as the community is simply too small.

cvkvtgd,0,t1_cvktuhq,Indricus,"My thought is that Islam has just as much business in politics as Christianity: fucking none. But there's no major party trying to turn the US into an Islamic theocracy, just a Christian one. ",1,0,1443729617,1444721046
cvkqw1w,0,t1_cvkqonw,Indricus,"They just want the welfare to come with social more strings attached. Look at the Salvation Army and their treatment of LGBT persons. If you're a white, cis, heterosexual Christian, they're 100% on board with giving you charity. If you're a black trans agnostic, you can burn in hell for all eternity, and the prison system is too good for you while waiting to get there. ",3,0,1443722633,1444721046
cvkpsbo,1,t3_3n3zav,Indricus,"As someone on the far left:

Democrats - banning guns, affirmative action, vilifying commerce, opposition to nuclear power.

Republicans - Christianity, banning abortion, Christianity, freedom of association for *public* businesses, Christianity, glorifying commerce, Christianity, supporting oil/coal, Christianity, opposing a driver's license approach to guns. Oh yeah, and did I mention Christianity? ",3,0,1443721010,1444721046

cvei3a2,0,t1_cvehz5d,Indricus,"They stand directly in opposition to a large number of very large businesses in a very large number of issues. That means, in the context of that segment of 'big business', breaking away from his Tea Party 'colleagues' to vote with Democrats would curry favor with numerous executives. That was my point, and you're being extremely thick-headed in not getting it.

edit: And for a general issue to nearly all big business: fucking immigration. There is nearly a universal consensus from the business community that we need to relax immigration restrictions, but when Trump said he wants to build a wall, the rest of the field doubled down rather than refute him.

cvehxu0,0,t1_cvehkj2,Indricus,"Rude? You asked the equivalent of, ""There's dinosaurs other than the T-Rex?"" and you have the gall to call *me* rude? It's a disingenuous question, because it can only come from a place of total and complete ignorance, and there is no excuse for such ignorance on the Internet. There are so many issues on which Republicans in Congress have sided with one group of multi-national corporations against another such group, that it is simply impossible to believe that you were posing an honest question.
