There is no doubt about that, but I believe Jon realizes that him and Stannis are generally on the same side and that he was the only one who had actually helped the Night's Watch when they needed it most.  It is just like what Samwell Tarly said about Stannis, he was ""a king who still cared.""  I still maintain that if Jon did not respect his leadership or resolve, he would have never wasted his breath giving Stannis the advice he gave. 

>Davos is loyal to Stannis, but I don't recall him ever (besides on the show) naming him his god see how he is a follower of the Seven. 

He certainly did in [Chapter 10](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Davos_Seaworth) of ACOK, specifically, ""King Stannis is my god. He made me and blessed me with his trust.""



>Ned wasn't all that positive about Stannis, instead he only accepted that he was Robert's heir because of his discovery.

Is that why Ned, ""found it hard to imagine what could frighten Stannis Baratheon, who had once held Storm's End through a year of siege, surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne sat outside with their hosts, banqueting in sight of his walls."" Or why he advocated for Stannis being named Warden of the East over Jaime after Jon Arryn had passed?  He also desperately wanted Stannis to come back to King's Landing not only to retake his seat because lets be honest, Stannis would probably have been a pretty strong supporter of what Ned wanted to get done.  Ned rebelled against a man who he viewed not fit to be King, do you really think he would have done all that he did to insure Stannis would sit the throne if he didn't respect him nor find him capable?  Noye certainly maintains Stannis's flaw, but don't think for a second that doesn't view Stannis's resolve admirable, which is what I was getting at.  Besides, Stannis has shown to bend, as seen in the link from my previous comment.    ",1,0,1444689695,1444716891

cvwiqw2,0,t1_cvw2z20,dickwhitman69,">No one respects him in the series. From Mance to Jon all keep on refusing every offer he makes

Sorry I do not see how Jon Snow sticking to his vows shows a lack of respect for Stannis. Jon has always wanted to be a Stark and in a sense he truly did showcase that he was a Stark by sticking to his vows and promises. Besides, if Jon truly didn't respect him, he would have never given him the advice to gain the support of the Mountain Clans or take back Deepwood Motte.

>Out of all great men in the series none think of Stannis as a good ruler or king

That is a pretty bold claim, obviously Davos Seasworth, who is pretty much the paragon of pragmitism, reason, and being aware of what is going on around him considers Stannis as his ""god"". Ned seems to have nothing but positive things to say about Stannis, so did Donal Noye and Tywin Lannister certainly respected the hell out of Stannis for whatever that is worth. All in all, while he is certainly flawed, that is what I like most about him, his grey sense of morality and pragmitism make him not only intriguing but obviously capable as well.

>Pretty sure he is going to burn his daughter in the books as well

Perhaps, but I would imagine the situation would be vastly more dire, I.e. sacrificing Shireen to stop the Others. This analysis makes me believe that if Shireen does indeed get burned, it will not be like anything from the [show.](http://i.imgur.com/B57apCI.jpg) There are some logistical issues from the books that will make that hard to happen as well.",1,0,1444617586,1444716891

While I am in no means trying to downplay the atrocities and lack of order that is going on in Libya, the situation in Syria should not be considered less of a quagmire than Libya.  According to the [U.N.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/15/syria-rebel-truce_n_6478226.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000592) some 250,000 Syrian civilians have died and almost 12 million people have fled the country.  Just because the U.S. Embassy was attacked and 4 Americans lost their lives in Benghazi does not mean that Libya and the many Libyans who have fled or are caught in the violence are in a worse position than Syria and the many Syrians who have fled and the ones in the middle of all the turmoil.",4,0,1444538120,1444716891
