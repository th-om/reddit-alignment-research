cvxlry4,1,t3_3ohvb2,cheeseysynapse,Funny. Climate science isn't aware of the bullshit studies being found out in nutrition and economics. But hey. They're studying the whole globe so they have to be right. ,1,0,1444697545,1444731830
cvw6smn,1,t3_3oc66t,cheeseysynapse,"Bullshit example used in the article. The indexes are weighted by market cap. Which means most of you money is going to be allocated to the top 25 stocks anyway. So there is no alternative to AAPL or XOM that aren't in an index. Could you come up with a niche fund that specializes in these unique situations? Sure, but what allocation would you give it?  Probably not big enough to matter. ",3,0,1444596549,1444731830

cvrrqrz,0,t1_cvrmm06,cheeseysynapse,"So, what if you started a DFS site.  You have to start with one deposit.

So, by definition, when DK and FD started, they were small - so they were immoral.

Why are you suspicious of people trying to break in to an industry?

Look what has just happened.

Where was the court order?  It didn't exist.

Where was the rules violation?  It didn't exist.

What happened?  It got out.  To the market.  Now, individuals are CHANGING THEIR BEHAVIOR WITHOUT A SINGLE LAW BEING WRITTEN.

Draft Kings was in the process of filing for an IPO.  You think that is gonna happen now?  Not this year.  Which is what they were hoping for.

Why are you afraid of letting millions of individuals regulate this.

Why do you need a bunch of panty wastes from DC that do NOT play DFS TELL YOU HOW YOU SHOULD PLAY?

And, you call yourself....libertarian/conservative?

I think you're a confused individual.",-1,0,1444253885,1444731830

cvrlo4c,0,t1_cvr80xq,cheeseysynapse,"Fuck you.  Competition is the answer. FD & DK would love regulations. It would build a moat around them. There are smaller firms that will gain market share because of this. Let us decide. Not some panty waste in DC
