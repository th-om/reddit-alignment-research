Furthermore, who in their right mind would ever buy it?  Seriously, you must have been high to think it was ever a good idea.

cvvpg2m,1,t3_3oaz5c,-_Upgrayedd_-,"Liberals use satirical humor based on insightful truths pinpointing the absurdity of certain actions, policies, or ideas.  Right wingers cannot do the same because when you examine their positions closely you realize quickly that in most cases they are on the absurd side of the argument therefore any insightful truth will only expose the hypocrisy of their narrative.  This leaves them with little more than petty mocking and mean spirited insults to fall back on which isn't really that funny and becomes tiresome quickly.",1,0,1444561584,1444721690

EDIT:  To explain: True communism can only arise in a reasonably prosperous, post industrial society.  Any place people have ever purported to establish ""communist"" governments have been impoverished feudal and/or agrarian societies where even if they held true to communist principles (and they didn't) they were still destined to fail because they never had the appropriate economic base.",-20,0,1443886249,1444721690
