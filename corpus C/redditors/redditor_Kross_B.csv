cvn9t0b,1,t3_3ne6l4,Kross_B,"It still hurt the GOP's national brand with regards to the center who largely blamed them for causing the shutdown. Granted the Dems had their own snafu with the botched initial rollout of ACA shortly after which put some of the heat off the Republicans.

But if a shutdown occurs here, the Democrats will use this to their advantage and present the GOP as completely unelectable in the eyes of non-affiliated voters who turn out more for the presidential election.",25,0,1443917272,1444719521
cvmh3mi,1,t3_3n9yjz,Kross_B,"This article might explain the reluctance by many conservatives and gun rights supporters in general regarding the issue of firearms control: http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/conservatives-gun-control-and-distrust/408643/

It sums up that pro-gun rights advocates simply cannot trust the government's word on that regulations will not equal an infringement of 2A rights, and  they believe liberals appear to be casually dismissing these concerns to their own detriment, preferring to blame everything on the NRA/gun lobbyists, which influences a common sentiment by gun owners that they are being unfairly picked on and belittled every time a mass shooting occurs.",2,0,1443845788,1444719521
cvhap2z,0,t1_cvh67sr,Kross_B,"Which is still a problem for the GOP if they push further right since it enables the Dems to paint them as a toxic brand for those outside the GOP base. And the current American electorate is inclining more in favor of economic and social solutions from the left.

They won't fracture, but you'd be seeing the possibility of the Dems repeating their ""Five in a Row"" streak from 1932-1952 and possibly even beyond.",5,0,1443472550,1444719521
cvc3a19,1,t3_3m4v2m,Kross_B,"We're not even sure there will be a shutdown, considering the GOP Establishment wants to avoid it, and Boehner is willing to get a clean bill passed even if it means attracting the ire of social conservatives.",1,0,1443058863,1444719521
cvc36fr,1,t3_3m53aj,Kross_B,"Boehner will push for a clean spending bill or stopgap measure at the last minute, knowing full well social conservatives and Tea Partiers will be out for his blood. 

He probably knows his days as Speaker are numbered anyway, so he might as well take one for the team to keep the GOP's hopes alive for '16.",2,0,1443058696,1444719521

If that doesn't happen, can Daesh even be defeated at all? It doesn't look like they're going to be collapsing internally anytime soon.",1,0,1442786655,1444719521

cv88e99,0,t1_cv8878m,Kross_B,"I had thought earlier in the year that it was a slow-burn effort to improve the Iraqis fighting capability and gradually, we would begin to see ISIS pushed out. Then came the fall of Ramadi, which came at the worst possible time considering the narrative by the Pentagon that ISIS was being put on the defensive. The lack of success in the ISF's counteroffensive, combined with both the reports of desertion and CIA/military intelligence cooking their supports has made any prospect of progress look suspect.

Meanwhile, I have to endure people like Rami Al Lolah bragging about how they will send the ""Kuffar Apostate Savafid Zionist scum to hell"" while the Western Crusaders die in their rage as ISIS establishes its Caliphate in spite of all the outrage its actions have elicited.",1,0,1442779990,1444719521

I honestly feel frustration and impatience over the Coalition, and specifically Obama's strategy is mounting to the point that people want more decisive action that just pinprick strikes. It certainly makes the prospect of teaming with Assad and Russia look appealing.",1,0,1442779310,1444719521
