cvvzy6p,1,t3_3oce13,sctilley,"Levine0 is correct, to be clear though:

In Magic 'match' and 'round' are the same thing. Each match consists of first player to win 2 games wins. 

This time system is called a 'chess clock'. It's completely unrelated to your games. Regardless of whether you are on your first, second or third game, regardless of who wins any of these games, if your clock runs out you get a match loss. 

If you're clock runs out you loose the match, no matter what. Otherwise any player who is losing could just sit back and wait for the clock to run out to force the draw. There were never be any losses. ",6,0,1444586242,1444723847

US Debt is a very important financial tool for the world economy. Because of the dollars position as the default world currency much of the world economy operates on US debt. This is very good for the US because it means we can borrow tremendous amounts of money with little cost, and it's good for the world to have a standard currency that they can trust. 

US debt is important for everyone, be it you and your 401K, Goldman Sachs, or China -- It's grease for the economy. 

Two:

When a government has money and when a government needs to spend money can be two different things. In fact [Keynesian Economic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics) (very popular) says that governments should spend more the worse the economy is doing (a bad economy usually means less tax revenue). It's basically what got us out of the great depression. How did we pay off that enormous amount of debt? (113% debt to GDP, 241.86 billion dollars) We never did, it's just insignificant now, because we got out of the great depression. ",18,0,1444406133,1444723847
cvsr41e,0,t1_cvsq78y,sctilley,"But this policy platform is 'free trade'. Free trade, when done correctly, is unambiguously a good thing. This is capitalism, this is basic economics, and no one opposes this. 

The USA has thousands of trade deals with every non embargoed country in the world. It's a major reason prosperity. Neither Clinton nor Sanders, nor anyone opposes these good trade deals. 

So yes I  think that it's ok to read the trade deal before you decide if its a good or bad one. 

Also just because a draft of a treaty got leaked does not mean you trust the leak or that it won't be changed. A draft can be different from a final version.

Look I'm still voting for Sanders, but you have to admit that this time its him pandering and Clinton making the presidential decision. He's playing the game too -- don't be naive. ",1,0,1444328335,1444723847
