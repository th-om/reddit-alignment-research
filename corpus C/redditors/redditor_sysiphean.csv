cvsfa4t,0,t1_cvs5szb,sysiphean,"So to give a little backstory:

My ex and I met and started dating our senior year of high school. We both went to college, in different directions, roughly 1000 miles apart. But we decided we were going to stay together because we were young and naive (but I repeat myself) and didn't realize we didn't really have anything to our relationship but physical affection.

Before classes started, I met a friend from the next room over, and we went out walking to meet people, hopefully a girl for single him. My now-wife and her roommate went out for the same reason, minus the romance. We bumped into each other, and future-wife and I ended up just talking about life for over two hours. We just... clicked. We both thought the other physically attractive (I initially told my buddy we should go talk to ""the girl with the legs"") but we hit it off on an emotional and intellectual and spiritual level like we had known each other forever.

And then we stayed friends. Just friends. Truly. No physical contact, no being alone together long, just talking about life and the meaning of everything and processing how the world works when you go off to college and leave your bubble. We obviously liked each other, but were both serious about the whole ""he has a boyfriend, so is off limits"" thing. And I talked to my long-distance girlfriend twice a week, and heard her repeatedly explaining how there are sooooo many guys there and almost no girls.

And we both ended up in a play together, and her part included kissing two different guys. I found out she had never kissed a guy before. (Life pro tip: you can be model gorgeous and still be a social outcast in high school if you don't ""fit"". Never presume your social status in high school has anything to do with your worth as a person, even if it is great status!) Since she didn't like either of the guys, I told her that if I didn't have a girlfriend I would kiss her just so she wouldn't have to kiss John or Todd for her first kiss. And then I didn't kiss her.

It was about a week later when I got the call from my ex saying we should see other people.

It was about a week after that that I came out of my funk enough to start going back to classes and showering and sleeping at night instead of wandering riverbeds and ravines.

It was about a week after that that now-wife and I were on a walk talking about life again, and she asked me if I was serious about that kiss.

It was the next night, on another walk and talk, that I pulled her close under a street light under a bright red maple tree with mist falling around us and finally kissed her. I didn't know what I meant by it, or what she meant by it, but tried to give her a fairy tale first kiss.

It was almost another week, after word got around campus that I was single, and after a couple of other girls started getting *really* chummy and close with me, that she decided to kiss me back, and then ask me to officially be her boyfriend. She had noticed the other girls moving in and wanted to keep them back. :)

It was about a week after that that, a week of turning our already amazing friendship into an amazing romance, that my ex called back.

In that month, she had been sampling the, uh, ""physical affections"" of the many gentlemen at her tech school. Whether she missed whatever non-physical relationship we had, whether she found out I was a better lover, or whether it was something else I will never know. We didn't stay in touch.",21,0,1444309887,1444726156

cvrg0jf,1,t3_3nu6e0,sysiphean,"She initially called me (from another college) to tell me she thought we should see other people. A month later she called me to say she ""hadn't found anyone better"" so we were a couple again.

I politely told her I was seeing someone.

That was the day that I learned that ""we should see other people"" meant ""I should see other people while you wait around for me to maybe come back.""

She also used all sorts of descriptors for the girl I was then seeing, and told me it wouldn't last because rebound relationships never do. She didn't know that this girl and I had been trying not to fall in love because I already had a girlfriend, and my ex inadvertently gave us the opportunity. That ""rebound"" relationship started almost exactly 20 years ago, and we've been married for 17.5 years.
