cvxoa84,0,t1_cvxm9u8,brodievonorchard," Um, no reason to get snippy, actually. I think a lot of the bike lanes installed during McGinn's term were poorly planned and serve to exacerbate car and truck traffic while endangering bikers. For example, the ones in the industrial district such as Airport Way. Where bikes are sharing a lane with car traffic on a street that gets a lot of tractor trailers. Also numerous high traffic streets that were cut down a lane to accommodate a bike lane.     
I want bike routes, I am simply expressing the opinion that creating more frustration for car drivers and shoehorning bike riders into that is unsafe for all parties involved. Yes car traffic is becoming a huge problem for this ever growing city and if we don't want to double everyone's commute time, we're going to need to improve the flow of traffic for everyone. I think the bus/duck collision really underscores my point here.    
Thankfully there is already multimodal progress being made with the expansion of light rail. However there are many setbacks at the same time. Bertha, toll bridges, etc.",-1,0,1444701370,1444718458

cvx9lht,0,t1_cvx8l97,brodievonorchard,"If you are truly unafraid, that comes from a place of emotional strength. That same quality tends to also impart empathy. If you're strong enough to face death, you're strong enough to understand those who aren't. Which should also mean you're strong enough not to need to belittle others. If you feel the need to parade it around, it's probably not true.

cvx8c8l,0,t1_cvx0ats,brodievonorchard,"I agree that more separate bike trails would be the way to go. We would need to be smarter about it than we were when Mike McGinn was mayor, though and keep high car and truck traffic routes and bike routes separate. We should be encouraging bike culture, but no matter how successful we are at that, we still need our stores stocked. That means truck traffic. Currently we're a city that is hostile to both bicycle and automobile traffic.",0,0,1444677094,1444718458

cvwmj4o,0,t1_cvwl5zw,brodievonorchard,"Ok, you've piqued my curiosity. In what sense is global warming entropy? We've added too much carbon into our atmosphere, remove said carbon either through directly extracting it from the air, or proliferation of passive extraction through some method and you solve the problem.
A bonfire burns out due to entropy, feed it more fuel, and you've conquered entropy. Right? I have a sense that you will disagree and I'm very interested to hear why.",1,0,1444625043,1444718458
