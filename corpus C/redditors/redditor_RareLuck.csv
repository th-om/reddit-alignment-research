cvuhoo2,0,t1_cvufwjz,RareLuck,"What do you define as ""throwing too much?"" 

Since I've been speaking about the first 4 games, where the game plan was just about the same, I'll use those stats.

Tommy had 89 completions out of 151 pass attempts. A completion percentage of 58.9. That's 5.6% higher than last year. That's a pretty solid increase and the game plan clearly seemed to be effective as he generated a good deal of offense, as evidenced by his total offense rankings, and our overall offensive output in those 4 games.

Through the first 4 games we ran the ball 145 times. That's 151 pass attempts to 145 runs, or a ratio of 1.04:1. That's a pretty balanced attack.

If we average out the pass attempts and runs then we get around 37.75 pass attempts per game and around 36.25 runs per game.

Through those 4 games we averaged 519.6 yards per game. Without the Illinois game, that would put us at 12th in Total Offense in the country. Even with the Illinois game we are 25th.

Why change the gameplan if it has proven to be effective? How much less should Tommy be throwing despite the fact that he has proven to be very good at the passes Langsdorf typically (typically being the key word) calls?

The biggest issue our offense has is penalties and, lately, dropped balls. It's not the gameplan. Just because a few calls are questionable, it doesn't mean the entire gameplan is shit.",1,0,1444449002,1444723624
cvuejvm,0,t1_cvubgui,RareLuck,"You're right. But the Illinois game is the deviation from the norm. In the first 4 games Langsdorf built a gameplan that focused on Tommy throwing the 5-15 yard passes, like I said. 

If they continue to use the Illinois gameplan, then I'll agree with you. But if they return to the gameplan they had the first 4 games, then I don't think you can make the case that they are forcing people into uncomfortable roles.",1,0,1444441965,1444723624

cvu0lqp,0,t1_cvtz9xt,RareLuck,Riley didn't call anything. Langsdorf calls the plays.,7,0,1444417671,1444723624
cvu0l31,0,t1_cvtydqe,RareLuck,"We have been absolutely snakebitten this year. Possibly 4 DTs out for the game tomorrow. 2 out of our starting 3 LBs out with the people starting at LB having combined for 11 total starts. Best DE out for tomorrow.

All that sets up great for you guys. I don't know about easy though.",9,0,1444417645,1444723624
cvu0icg,0,t1_cvtxgdh,RareLuck,"Well if you look at the bulk of our games I think you'd see we do have an offense. The Illinois game was the deviation from the norm. 

In the first 4 games we were able to move the ball quite well and Tommy Armstrong was passing with a great deal of efficiency. 

Now, who knows what we will see tomorrow but I think it is a bit disingenuous to just say we don't have an offense.",4,0,1444417532,1444723624
cvu0exp,0,t1_cvtqv02,RareLuck,"I'm glad they included that one black guy. For a second there I was worried that there might be an uneven amount of white people, but they put my worries to rest.",5,0,1444417387,1444723624
