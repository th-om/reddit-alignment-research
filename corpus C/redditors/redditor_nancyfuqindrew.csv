But because we now know he actually was capable of multiple homicides, hundreds of people upvote a post implying her decision was selfish and stupid.  Total armchair quarterbacks.  They always know best after the fact.",1,0,1444345777,1444721306
cvsz8bv,0,t1_cvsyua1,nancyfuqindrew,"Right, but she probably thought with all the witnesses that at best it would be another step.",1,0,1444340182,1444721306
cvsz6qc,0,t1_cvsyplo,nancyfuqindrew,"A reliable source... she had probably heard it from him herself multiple times.  Surrounded by people, she probably thought he'd be angry and maybe violent, but maybe didn't believe he'd go so far as kill her as well as four other people.  

In many situations, people don't want to ""overreact"".  ",1,0,1444340112,1444721306
cvsysy5,0,t1_cvsp30r,nancyfuqindrew,"You're saying that because you have the benefit and hindsight to know she actually was murdered.  This week Philadelphia Universities were warned by the ATF that there was an anonymous threat to carry out an attack like the recent one at Oregon.  Most people showed up to school and work, however.  If a shooting had happened, I guarantee people would say it was stupid for the people who were shot to go in.  But the fact is that most of the time people who threaten to kill someone DO NOT DO IT.  So you can act like she fucked up, or you can acknowledge that she played the odds and lost.",2,0,1444339535,1444721306
cvsyncf,0,t1_cvsgkbb,nancyfuqindrew,"Just speculating here, but he probably had threatened to kill her in the past.  She was definitely in fear but possibly not for her life.  Maybe she just thought she was at risk of violence, and probably not for the first time.",1,0,1444339298,1444721306
cvsyiuc,0,t1_cvsqfah,nancyfuqindrew,"She deemed it a valid threat, but not necessarily of murder.  Chances are this wasn't the first time he threatened to kill her.  He probably physically abused her in the past.",1,0,1444339108,1444721306
cvsyfyd,0,t1_cvsjo2f,nancyfuqindrew,"Not only using hindsight to judge what she should have done, but actively blame her.  Poster above says she considered her birthday party ""more important"", and speculates that maybe she didn't warn the others.  Of all the people to blame in this scenario, they pick the victim.",1,0,1444338985,1444721306
cvsybul,0,t1_cvs9s20,nancyfuqindrew,"Maybe she didn't believe he would actually kill her, but thought he would be violent and that's why she called the police.  Surrounded by people probably gave her a relative feeling of ""safety"".  

But no, let's imply she was selfish and cruel.",1,0,1444338815,1444721306
