So?

> there are millions who rely on Social Security and Medicare to survive.

Has been acknowledged.  

>These programs represent a social contract for all Americans.

A social contract that any current workers can't expect to see provided for them.  

>Considering how poorly most Americans are prepared for retirement via private means

Largely because 7% of your paycheck is taken for you.  Making the young poorer early on and stressing their position to save money.

>They can cherry pick polling but take a look here her numbers have been pretty consistent.

In the graph that is cut off on the bottom, you see a drop off from the 60s to where she is now.

>There's no big spikes and drops. She hasn't lost ten points in one week. That doesn't happen unless there is a massive race changing bombshell. There has been no such thing.

I imagine it is largely an artifact of sampling size error, but she is being investigated by the  FBI.
