cvw10cr,0,t1_cvvuui5,superkamiokande,">No. Guns are designed for shooting. Killing is something they can do. I own a gun. I don't kill people with it, and have no intention of killing people with it. I shoot targets with it.

You're being fairly disingenuous here, OP. How you personally use guns is not a reflection of their designed purpose. It's extremely disingenuous to claim that guns are not designed to kill, as it would be to say swords are not designed to kill. That is their explicit purpose - it is the reason they were invented. 

If I keep a hammer in my house because I think it looks nice, and I never once use it to hammer a nail, that does not mean that hammers weren't invented to hammer nails. It just means I'm not using it for its designed, stated purpose.",4,0,1444587896,1444726392
cvvwsbg,0,t1_cvvuuzp,superkamiokande,"That would still leave 800,000 people alive in the greater San Francisco/Bay area, which still seems high. How many people do you think were living in that commune?

But maybe the total surviving population isn't the right way to estimate dead from the flu, because some could have died in the ensuing chaos.",3,0,1444580939,1444726392
cvvu1c8,0,t1_cvvs5s3,superkamiokande,"I guess I was thinking that since women have a regular discharge, this might be seen as the body ""purging"" the polluted blood, or something. But you're right, I'm conflating Jewish ritual purity and blood taboos with the Greek taboos, and in that confusion menstruation and other types of unclean blood seemed related.",1,0,1444575648,1444726392
cvury4z,1,t3_3o6jwb,superkamiokande,"In the film they say it wiped out half the population, but I take that as figurative, since it would still leave a huge number of people alive (over 3 billion), which does not match what we see in the movie.

In the BaynArea alone, there'd be almost 4 million people, which is clearly not the case.

However many survivors there are, it has yto be low enough to be comparable to the population of apes, which is starting from a very low number. So I have to imagine the survival rate for the flu was abysmally low.",3,0,1444486561,1444726392

Does menstruation factor into this at all?",2,0,1444400972,1444726392
