I'm not sure if it was popular or not when it first came out. But most people around my age (25) have never heard of it.

It was Edward Norton's first film. A crime mystery with by far my favorite ending of any movie.

Voter ID laws. I don't see the problem with having to prove your identity in order to vote, as long as obtaining the ID is free and convenient (something every republican I know wants).

Military Adventurism- While the republicans are generally more hawkish then democrats, you have side of the republican party that strongly believes in isolationism (those libertarians that you seem dislike so much.) At this point though I would say some military action is needed, Obama's one black mark will be his foreign policy and the state that middle east is currently in. We have investment in the Middle east that need protecting, there are also people in the middle east that need protecting. You can't have the economy and standard of living that we enjoy without an international presence and we maintain that with our military. If the democrats gain control and just pull out of the middle east, eastern Europe, and Asia and the world starts to fall apart, well then I think i would call them the bad guys.  

Supply-side Economics. Supply-side economics is the belief that investing in capital and business will cause a greater supply of goods and services and thus lower prices and increase job creation. This in turn leads to the most efficient and effect form of economic growth. How does believing this make someone a bad person? 

The Modern Eugenics Movement. I'm not sure why you think republicans are all in favor of eugenics. Its a mixed bag that I find republicans and democrats both split on. Even so, if we assume that republican = for eugenics, you haven't said why that makes someone a bad person. Evolution in itself is a natural form eugenics, as our species evolves we will naturally carry the traits that make us the strongest and most likely to survive.

Flat Tax Proposals- Again why does this make someone a bad person? Most republicans that I know don't want a straight flat tax, just a reduction of the current progressive tax brackets with an increase to sales taxes. 

Privatized Social Security. Again this is something that republicans don't agree on. What we do know is that as of right now social security won't be solvent after 2037. We need to something about it. Is privatizing it the right answer? maybe. If the stock market continues is trend over the last of last 100 years then it would be smart decision. But it's a risk, it's also a risk to do nothing and have our funds dry when we need them. Either way what makes someone a bad person for wanting more control over their retirement funds?

Privatized Post Office- Again why is this a bad thing? if the post office can't support itself, while private companies can why should they stay in business. obviously something needs to be done about the last mile delivery problem and if fedex or ups can figure out an efficient way to deal with that then I have no problem with taking over the mail delivery service. 

Libertarianism- Don't know where to start with this. What about this ideology makes someone a bad person?

Theoretically in 50 years we could start replacing every organ in a persons body. Synthetic muscles, skins, bones, eyes, everything. Your brain is basically a big computer so the next step would be hooking up your brain to your synthetic body. 

I've seen theories where the belief is that the next step in evolution will be technological instead of biological. Things like computer chips in your brain to increase performance. Theoretically we could see this advancement during your lifetime. ",3,0,1444515491,1444730458
