> Theists build a box around themselves keeping Irrefutable Truths out with only themselves inside. Their means of living is purely self-sufficient, cutting off all the blessings and beauty of knowing the Facts about Reality, only doing, controlling and becoming what they can manage. It is like they say, “All I want. All I need is right here in this box.”

Your God is small and will die with your followers, and your scripture is filled with lies.  My physics will last eternally, and my science books are filled with the truest equations and facts that have ever been known.  Your books describe the internally inconsistent fantasies and fears of ancient goat-herders, and it shows in what little progress and what great meannesses you have accomplished in the last few thousand years.  My books describe the exact inner workings of the entrie fuckng universe, and it shows what magnificence science, technology and medicine has created, in even the last few decades alone.
