In October 2011, the approval rating for the ACA hovered around 38%. The most recent Rasmussen poll has it at 43%.

For another thing, what source are you using for Obama's approvals a year ago? RCP has him at around 42% this time last year. I know RCP's methodology is flawed, but they're generally close enough.",1,0,1444672882,1444718718

cvuaass,0,t1_cvu8qe2,JohnZoidberg1985,"No, it needs congress and the states to implement it.

I read the link, it centers around this piece of Underpants Gnome logic:

1. Win the Presidency
2. Compel Congress to pass reform
3. Establish a government that works

No plan or idea is given for how #2 would be accomplished. It's just assumed that if the right president is elected it will happen, somehow.",2,0,1444433607,1444718718

If Biden runs, the Clinton campaign, maybe the Sanders campaign, and the Republicans would try to bring up the plagiarism issue again, but I don't think it would be a big deal because it's a minor issue and it was a very long time ago.",0,0,1444433256,1444718718
