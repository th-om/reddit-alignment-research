cvvc9h7,0,t1_cvvbkuh,passionlessDrone,"> There was no political will, especially in the Democratic party to engage ISIS on the ground, which is a damn shame considering what happening and how easy it'd be for the US to stop.

But what happens *next*?  I think that the lack of political will also incorporates a much needed ability to think ahead one step past smashing a bunch of shitbirds in converted pickup trucks, past destroying ISIS.  We might be picking up on the fact that we aren't very good at nation building, especially in that area.  I generally consider myself progressive, but goddamn it, the ME has had a long time to get past tribal allegiances and they just can't do it.  Fixing that is a multi-generational effort with a black hole of costs up front for the possibility of a better place for our grandchildren.

Have you ever heard of the book, Guns Germs and Steel?  You should check it out, it more or less makes this argument, along with others, regarding how some regions turned into powers, while other regions faltered.

cvqtf43,0,t1_cvqry27,passionlessDrone,"> I was being asked different questions and therefore providing different answers.

You started your narrative with a strikingly different build of your husband though.  No one was asking you anything; you painted *this picture* at post time:

> Women lose desire for their husband because they're bored with him. He's probably still fairly attractive to her, in that if he weren’t her husband, she’d check him out if he walked by her on the street. He's probably a good person, good father, and a pretty good partner. She really wishes she wanted to have sex with him because it's causing problems in her marriage, but just doesn't want to. 

That's a lot different than the guy with no interests, who has relegated all household responsibilities to his wife, and who serially neglects her sexual needs.  

I didn't read the entire threat, it was long, and I found myself enraged at you after enough time had gone by.  Then you posted here, and suddenly you sounded (mostly) justifiable, or at least understandable past a five year old who wants cookies for breakfast because eating oatmeal is boring.  

> However, when someone asks what he could have done differently, to say, ""Nothing,"" wouldn't be helpful or honest.

My only point is that none of these things were apparent in your original posting, nor in a great number of your responses where you did nothing but harp on how great your husband is, just not desirable.  I'm not sure that is helpful either, in fact, it probably wound up giving a lot of people the wrong idea.  If, indeed, you elaborated to this point deeper down the comments, it is a shame that you didn't add them as edits, as opposed to just doubling down on 'it's boring'; i.e., 

> Welcome TRP guys! Interesting that you hate me and you're calling me a whore for a post you could essentially use to SUPPORT your theories about relationships. That women will get bored of you and cheat. 

That isn't what happened to you; you got bored of the guy ignoring your sexual needs and not being competent around the house.  I guess I'm just confused, not really too interested in dissecting it. 

The irony is that some of the RP stuff ties directly to what your husband *should have been doing* correctly, stay interesting, be competent, and please your partner, and you will remain sexually attractive.
