Common soldiers were fucked though. They didn't have any money and nobody wanted to bother feeding them so yeah, dead meat.

We aren't in a situation where we have more GPU power than we want because consoles r holding us back!!!",1,0,1444427061,1444727766
cvtf4j9,1,t3_3o1jpd,KKV,"They could've run at 1080p if they wanted to lock 30 FPS or use graphics quality settings below the PC's high (which is about what they use).

We know, we know, the PS4 and Xbox One are using cut down and underclocked versions of the 7870 and 7790. They aren't amazing GPUs.

When the next GPU cycles come around and the consoles are further behind, if developers don't bother giving PC access to better IQ settings, higher resolutions and framerates will be more common to soak up the GPU power. Same thing happened in the 7th gen consoles.

Arguably consoles don't hold back PC games at all since without the revenue from consoles, developers couldn't put near the same kind of money into developing games for only PC users.

Witcher 2 vs Witcher 3 is a perfect example.

DLC is the present and microtransactions are the future, deal with it. They aren't making much money selling games for $50-60 but they don't want to give sticker shock by upping prices to $80 or $90, so they offer little pieces of bullshit for people who really want more content or a new hat. Whatever.

If you don't like DLC or microtransactions don't buy them. I don't like paying $8 for a bottle of water at a sporting event so I don't buy them. 

I prefer it this way anyway. Do I want to pay $60 for a game and have options to spend another $30 on content if I like the content, or do I want to pay $90 up front without knowing all about the content? I'll take door number optional.
