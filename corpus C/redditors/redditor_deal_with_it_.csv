Yea, sick cut halfway through.  I'm sure the driver did something that caused the cop to go off on a racist rant and mock his speech.

Or the one where they kick a compliant suspect in the face. 

Or the one where they release dogs onto a group of women.

Or the one where a cop grabs a woman on the street for no reason then try to assault a guy who defends her.

Or the one that is literally a series of videos where cops are throwing people out of wheel chairs.

[Or when a cop spits on someone and then says he did it because he was filming him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJgJc3ZSX6M)

I'm sure they were all asking for it and this is just deceptive editing/titling to make cops look bad.
