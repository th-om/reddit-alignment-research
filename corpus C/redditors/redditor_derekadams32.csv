cvi65lj,0,t1_cvi48va,derekadams32,">Millennial here. Haven't experienced that government regulation has made it more difficult for me to work.

That's great!  I have.  My wife has.  Most of my friends have.  We are all individuals with our own experiences.  The point I was making is that when a Millennial has that experience, they quickly realize how the government is making things more difficult for them personally.  

>I feel like I've done pretty well for being in such a ""terrible"" environment.

Me too.  Great for us.  My three best friends are all still riding the struggle bus, metaphorically speaking.  Again, we are all individuals with our own experiences. 

> Bartending you say? Did these victimized Millennials go to college? What degree did they pursue? Did they even have a plan for their future?

Some got terrible degrees with no job demand, sure.  It didn't help that the older generations and the government were telling them that ""you can be anything you want to be"" and ""you have to go to college after high school"".  There are tons of problems with our higher-education system.  The point is that it's getting harder and harder to get well-paying salaried positions and become a home owner.

>So, left-leaning Millennials are supposed to support Rand Paul too? I'll pass, thanks.

2 -- When I use the world *terrible*, I'm referring to the overall environment that Millennials are growing up in -- constant war, rough job market, high cost of living, etc.  Eight more years of Millennials living in apartments and bartending and you could see a shift in voting based on the party of the President.

*Prison Reform for non-violent offenses (minor drug charges and such).  

*De-escalate our involvement overseas because he is willing to admit that America causes more problems than it solves.

*Tax Reform.  Our current system is terrible and favors the rich who can afford to take advantage of the loopholes.

*Get government out of marriage -- yes please.

*Get government out of surveillance -- yes please.

*Make congress approve acts of war -- yes please.

The idea is to force your opponent to remove every card you play, then they have no removal left for either Ysera or Paletress. Deathlord = must remove. Holy Champion = must remove. Auchenai = must remove. Sylvannas = must remove. Blademaster - must remove. Meanwhile, there is enough hard removal, AOE, healing, and card draw to keep things moving. 

Here is my list:


2 Circle

1 Flash Heal

2 Light of the Naaru

2 PW:S

2 Northshire Cleric

1 Zombie Chow

2 SW:P

2 Wild Pyro

2 SW:D

2 Deathlord

1 Injured Blademaster
