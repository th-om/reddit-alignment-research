I'm debating if this is worth the $89, especially since I don't have any plans for Hawaii any time soon. I am planning a trip to Australia/NZ via Tokyo might be able to use this for SYD->MEL on Virgin and/or US-> Tokyo on Hawaiian. (Also have a stash of MR to transfer if needed...)

I wasn't counting on getting the Aug transactions back, so I spent more than $200 on MPX (if you counted those Aug transactions as part of the $200). I got reimbursed for all the 8/27 and 8/28 amounts, and partial for the Oct transactions up til the $200 ceiling",1,0,1444655713,1444718346

cvtrz5k,0,t1_cvsiu9t,shortyfirechurning,"The US on the whole has very little tariffs on imports compared to other countries in the agreement. Getting rid of these tariffs is beneficial to the US by making our exports cheaper internationally.

I won't comment on IP protection because we don't know what is in the bill and what you said is blind speculation. But it is designed to stop black market drugs in Africa and knock off widgets and apps in China, benefiting the US in the global economy.

What do you mean it ""deregulates markets""? It has added a lot of environmental and labor regulations and such. It reduces our ability to remain competitive in certain industries that we would have lost the ability to remain competitive anyway. These agreements allow us to balance that by gaining access to these countries' economies so it helps the US economy as well. The US economic trajectory has been shifting from manufacturing to service based for literally hundreds of years. It is nothing new and it won't cause the sky to fall.

""Wholesale giveaway of everything that is american""? This is the same alarmist thing people said when industrial jobs left the country. Yes in the short run it is going to hurt some industry's labor force, anyone who says otherwise is lying. But in the long run it will be beneficial for the US economy. By boosting these other countries' economies, it will give the US more access to international customers that will create new jobs in new sectors that will be better than the existing jobs that will be lost.

Those courts already exist, corporations can take governments to court if they feel the government is unduly placing trade barriers on them that is against a trade agreement. This bill aims to regulate those EXISTING procedures so they're not as exploitable. Anyway, if the courts decide that the government is *indeed* wrong, why is that a bad thing? It can only enforce written law, not make up new international law. That would spark outrage (what country would take that?)

On the whole your two legitimate points are:

1. IP laws : which we don't know yet and I hope isn't to the level of SOPA etc. I am optimistic about this since it is a multinational agreement and I'm not sure how those things could be prosecutable under those circumstances

2. Loss of jobs (i.e. what you said as losing competitiveness) : this is again a short run (but valid) concern that happens with all free trade agreements. People don't come out against environmental regulation that hurts labor in certain industries because it is acknowledged that in the long run this is beneficial because it will create better, new jobs is renewable energy sector. This is the same idea with these agreements. However since there's no tangible link like that example, people have a hard time convincing themselves of that.",1,0,1444404805,1444718346
