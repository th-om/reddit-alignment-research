A straw man is arguing against an easily defeated version of an argument that no proponent of that side actually holds. The weak man is arguing against an easily defeated version of an argument that *some people* actually do hold, but is not actually representative of what most proponents of that side thinks. 

Basically, if you argue for atheism by arguing against really, really dumb religious views, and somebody accuses you of unfairly representing your opponents, you can't just point to the Westboro Baptist Church and say, ""this isn't a strawman, there are real, physical people who believe this!"" Yes, and that might be a good reason not to join the WBC, but to use that as evidence against religion in general is not giving most of your opponents nearly enough credit.

cvizq1f,0,t1_cvixz0t,raserei0408,"While I'm sympathetic to your point, I think many (probably most) feminists take it too far in the other direction. I worry that a lot of identity politics is too willing to use hyperbolic rallying cries to garner support without any self-awareness of the hyperbole. As far as I can see, countering a bad position by going too far in the other direction doesn't actually result in most cases falling in the middle; you just get them split between the two terrible extremes. 

Also, you're right that pointing a finger won't get a conviction in most courtrooms, but it's enough in a lot of college hearings, let alone among a group of friends. And no, these kinds of accusations don't put someone in jail, but they can and do run  peoples' lives. ",-1,0,1443589747,1444731128
cvizc67,0,t1_cviu6pa,raserei0408,"> The problem is the multiple highly-visible rape accusations that have been proven or generally believed to be false.

It doesn't help that the high-profile cases people hear about are pretty much pre-selected to be the least likely to be true. 

High-likelihood theory:

The cases people will hear about are the ones that people argue about the longest. Four witnesses and video evidence, open and shut, nothing more to say. Lots of conflicting info and weak evidence, people can and will argue literally for months. Shockingly, cases with conflicting information are less likely to be true. 

Highly cynical theory: 

The cases people will hear about are the ones social justice people rally around. For many social justice is a primary part of who they are. Social justice people want to be seen as super into social justice. Rallying around an obviously cut-and-dry case demonstrates nothing about your devotion to social justice because any non-bigot would do the same. Rallying around a controversial case and plugging your ears to any evidence to the contrary signals lots of devotion to social justice.

cvirzeq,0,t1_cviavcq,raserei0408,"> They think it's all a way for women to avoid responsibility for unwanted sex. They believe there's a wave of false accusations.

Far too many women are raped and not believed. Far too many men are falsely accused of rape. These statements are not mutually exclusive.

The oft-cited statistic is that only 2-10% of rape reports are false accusations. People quibble about those numbers in one way or another, but for the time being, let's take them at face value. Many feminists use this to suggest that false accusations are very rare and we should always take rape accusations at face value. But consider, according to these statistics, as many as 1 in 10 of those guys is innocent. To me, if we are to just believe every woman at face value, that's not an acceptable false positive ratio. 

This is a really hard problem without an obvious solution that isn't terrible. In the absence of a solution that doesn't harm innocent people, by far the easiest solution is to declare that the people who might be harmed don't exist. This is why so many men make ridiculous claims like ""if it's a legitimate rape, the body has ways of shutting that whole thing down."" On the other hand, this is why [35,000 people reblogged an article claiming that being falsely accused was less likely than being hit by a comet.](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/17/lies-damned-lies-and-social-media-part-5-of-%e2%88%9e/) (The article was demonstrably off by at least 4 orders of magnitude, and possibly a couple more.) Believing that all rape accusations can be safely ignored because all women are lying sluts is a really easy solution, but so is believing that false accusations are rarer than comet strikes. 

I think we need to be skeptical when faced with a rape accusation. We should be compassionate and supportive, for sure, but a presumption of guilt is really, really dangerous.",5,0,1443574731,1444731128
