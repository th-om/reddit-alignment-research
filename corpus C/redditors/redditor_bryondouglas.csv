And from my understanding dbt therapy is the only therapy that is at all effective with personality disorders. So I'm not sure if you completely missed the reference or are some kind of ninja-reference master,3,0,1444704276,1444718706

With two young kids we either go to riverfront or findlay market or something. If it was all connected I would be much more inclined to spend a day there",4,0,1444589154,1444718706
cvvw9gy,0,t1_cvvu69a,bryondouglas,"Narwhal's are different: ""While narwhal's reproductive system is essentially identical to ours they have significant differences.
Narwhal's (and all cetaceans) males reproductive organ that would be outside the body in humans and land mammals like the penis and testes are actually inside the narwhal is body.
The narwhal is penis is flexible and when not erected is able to retract into the narwhal's body in what scientist call a genital slit (similar to a bag-like space for the penis to be inside the body), when erect the penis peeks out of the slit. However since the testis needs to be cooler than the body in other to produce healthy sperm, the blood that runs through the narwhal is fins is cooled down and this blood is immediately send to the testicle, as the cooled blood passes through the testicle this helps cool them down, those allowing for the production of healthy sperm[2]. the narwhals also have a vas deferens which transport the sperm to the penis for sexual intercourse.""",2,0,1444579993,1444718706
