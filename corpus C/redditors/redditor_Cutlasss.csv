But, see here's the other problem with the way the Sunday delivery program is set up. If the carrier leaves notice, then you have to go to the post office to pick it up. If the carrier just takes it back to the office, then your regular carrier will attempt to deliver it on Monday (or in this case Tuesday, because of the holiday). And since the regular carrier has a better idea of what they can and cannot leave at the destination address, that would often get you your package sooner. 

Part of this is Amazon's fault, because they want all the packages left, whether or not there is a safe place to leave them. And the carriers, who have otherwise been trained to not leave a package in a place they think is unsafe (and they have a general knowledge of what is true of that in their area) has the mindset that they are doing right by the customer when not leaving a package they think is very likely to be stolen. 

Now, regular carriers do not do the Sunday Amazon delivery. Only new people get that job. So there's a problem with both conflicting training and inexperience. And then, as I said, the scanner doesn't offer the right options, and so they may choose the wrong one, and possibly correct it later.",1,0,1444574299,1444718632

In fact, that's exactly what it does. Just not in full. 

>Not to mention how do you expect to get off this automatic balancer once it starts?

Automatically. That's why they're called automatic stabilizers. When the economy declines, more people qualify for unemployment and welfare, fewer people pay taxes. When the economy improves, that reverses.

>Why not address the reason for the 'crisis' if you want to reduce economic volatility.

Now? There are billions of possible reasons why the economy is unstable, and occasionally goes into recession. There is no cure for that. ",4,0,1444573520,1444718632
cvvsoc3,1,t3_3o8pgh,Cutlasss,"This happens because the scanners USPS use kinda suck. And so there's not a correct option to enter into them when the carrier can't leave the package, or for some reason a notice. The carrier in question, who is probably a very new CCA, didn't know any better, because none of the options the scanner does allow are actually the correct option. ",2,0,1444572441,1444718632
