cvpnbus,1,t3_3nlkle,Oracle_Fefe,"My partner and I are two out-of-this-world people in this discussion; I use the Wii's Classic Controller Pro and she uses Wiimote and Nunchuk.

When it comes to the GCC, I only feel its perfection in other smash games, Smash 4 has my muscle memory behaving erratic for me and even the Pro Controller's layout feels strange for me. I prefer the asymmetrical layout of the wii Classic Controller Pro (these names...) and both its lightweight feel and shoulder buttons; a digital input is much easier to press than any analog input. Even I cannot fathom how my friend wrecks me with her control scheme but to each their own.

However, I understand the desync issues that occur during big events. For Pro controllers, I believe they should be played wired to the Wii U. A Classic Controller Pro sadly would require some wiimote-to-usb adapter to trick the Wii U into believing it is a Pro Controller.

Sadly, the Wiimote + Nunchuk cannot be directly connected in any way that would cause it to sync properly. But by then, wouldn't it be easy to make a small list of players to keep track of?",1,0,1444097470,1444722168
cvmb5ez,1,t3_3n8uab,Oracle_Fefe,"Like others have stated, my advice would be to actually re-plan the whole resume step.

You need to list a small summary of skills and objectives. Give your education emphasizing your Bachelors (and college too if it is a big shot). State your former work experience including being an Environment Artist for a community-based project (M).

Then fully list your # years of experience in Video Game Art (~10 years), along with expertise in Photoshop, Maya, 3ds Max, and ZBrush (You can perhaps specify Adobe and Autodesk software in general if you have some minor proficiency)

Don't just have it on your website. Make it into a PDF for people to download. Shoot an email through your former school's Career department if that is possible. I presume you already had checked Job Listings nearby but check out any companies you are interested in that are also based in Seattle and just shoot their HR an email inquiring about open positions.

That's from what my internship class told me, that I was able to absorb. I wish you the best of luck and we would be glad if you keep us updated.",6,0,1443832392,1444722168

cvijnzv,0,t1_cvidjce,Oracle_Fefe,"Assuming that one can acquire federal loans or grants to last their college career, and then immediately find a position in a (competitive, location-based, or perhaps oversaturated) career market, then any student in many majors other than the few listed won't be bared from going to college.

It is a worrisome state for students in these fields of study who can not acquire one of the above-listed categories. The statements you made shall work for an ideal citizen, but certain Immigrants, including college-bound DREAMers, that aren't eligible for any federal funding may find their path not so clear-cut.",1,0,1443560772,1444722168
