If Senator Sanders won, he'd similarly fail to deliver on a huge chunk of his platform. He would struggle to rein in the same influences that President Obama has struggled to rein in. He would have to accept compromises that would make his supporters think he'd sold out. He would get into the Oval Office on that first day and get all the intelligence, information, and details about our foreign policy that are too deep into the minutiae to discuss on the Senate floor, let alone in a campaign. 

Honestly, people had unrealistic expectations about the powers of the presidency and the realities of American politics when President Obama was elected. He played a part in stoking those expectations, but if you look at what he did and what Senator Sanders is doing now, you'd be a fool to think Senator Sanders isn't making even bigger and less realistic promises. 

If you walk into politics with your head in the clouds, you'll wind up thinking you've been had. Then you quit voting for mainstream candidates. Then your views get more marginalized than ever and the people governing you start talking more and more differently from you. This is why progressive politics is more of an uphill battle in this country than it should be. Progressives are unrealistic and, ultimately, dissuaded from effective participation.

Half the comments in this sub are pedantic bullshit that doesn't further discussion, so singling out someone telling you to shut your pie hole is a childish thing to do. And the mods in this sub are biased as all hell. If a conservative said that, the comment would stay. I gave up reporting right wing vitriol a long time ago.

cvtty0x,0,t1_cvtmnyu,minorsaint,"This is inappropriate. If you get offended at ""shut ya pie holes"" then you need to avoid political debates. You can't expect other people to bubble wrap the world for you. 

I don't know what else that poster said, since the comment is gone, but if that's the extent of it, and it was removed by a mod, that's a clear abuse of authority and the mod that removed it needs to be removed themselves. 

Civility is one thing. Stunted, stilted, milquetoast debate is another. We talk about important things that people care about. Things that are, often, life or death decisions. Passion is good. A little fire is good. Some name calling is even tolerable and often a perfectly human and, frankly, entertaining way to blow off steam. 

This seems like an attempt to censor a viewpoint based on the other side taking minor offense. If this is going to be rule, every post that refers to Democratic presidents as ""Democrat"" should be deleted. Every post that calls someone a ""statist"" needs to be banned. Every post that uses the phrase ""gun grabber"" needs to be banned. Otherwise it's clearly a case of conservative mods hunting for reasons to ban liberal comments. I don't think banning any of those comments is appropriate. 

Rather, I think ""uncivil"" banning should be reserved for people making threatening comments, making personal attacks unrelated to the debate, and attacking a person's irrelevant and immutable characteristics. 

What you're looking for is a lifeless, sanitized, gutless debate. If you have a problem with someone telling you to shut your pie hole, you have no place in the adult world. Kindly grow up before posting here again. ",-7,0,1444407762,1444717652

Let me spoil it for you:

The top comments will all be militantly pro-gun. Any anti-gun comment will get downvoted, usually out of sight. 

This sub follows a simple rule: downvote opinions you don't agree with. 

It's clear that this sub is *heavily* pro-gun. Do you really need another example of that? For fuck's sake. ",8,0,1444099036,1444717652

cvo6bff,0,t1_cvntywl,minorsaint,"Your point on gun control is maybe an opportunity for discussion. 

I favor the repeal of the Second Amendment. I didn't used to. The only reason I do now is that the response to calls for even moderate gun control is to hold up the Second Amendment like its a unassailable trump card. The right has become radicalized on this issue and I feel its forced my hand. 

So your expressed view of radicalization is actually precipitating the radicalism you were afraid of. 

At this point I'd favor every democratic president employing a litmus test to every judicial nominee and only appointing those who will overturn Heller, et. al. By hook or by crook, regardless of the tactics employed, I want the Second Amendment gone or at least neutered. If there was room for reasoned, moderate discussion, I wouldn't feel this way and I never did before Sandy Hook (and the disgusting response to it from the NRA and gun lobby). I would prefer compromise. But the right seems to prefer a street fight to a debate. And street fights aren't fair. And I'm not squeamish. I'm also not alone. ",1,0,1443991662,1444717652
cvnw45f,0,t1_cvnv4qs,minorsaint,"And that girl who had the pepper spray taken from her would've had a gun taken from her, too. And then there'd be an armed rapist wandering around campus. Is that really preferable? 

The point is that if you're armed with the intent to kill anyone who fucks with you, you've taken shitty situations (I've been mugged at knifepoint, it sucks, but the guy just wanted my money, not my life) and made them into kill-or-be-killed situations. Jeffries big point that you're missing is that most criminals aren't out to murder you or your family. They want your shit. Good locks and an alarm system are actually a deterrent, a gun just takes a situation and escalates it to a life and death fight. 

If I'd had a gun when I was mugged, maybe I would've defended myself successfully. Maybe reaching for it would've made the guy stab me. Maybe I beat him to the draw and now I've had to shoot someone (which, unless you're sociopathic, doesn't feel good). Or I could just give him the $40 I had and call the police after. Of all those options, I would spend the $40 any day. ",0,0,1443976618,1444717652

cvm759k,1,t3_3n9yjz,minorsaint,"Don't even bother, dude. 

There can be no debate with these people on this issue. Too much depends on holding on to their established point of view. 

If they were to even begin to acknowledge that *maybe*, just *maybe* more regulations would make us safer, that would leave them with a truth they can't accept. Because if gun regulations could lower gun violence and gun deaths, then that means all the effort, all the vitriol, all the hatred they direct toward anyone who brought them up would have been effort that ultimately cost lives. If these deaths in Oregon were preventable, then their labor and effort on this issue contributed to death. 

Obviously you can't accept such a truth about yourself. Your subconscious goes into self-defense mode to preserve your psyche and the answer has to be, *has to be* ""nothing could stop this"". It's pathological. There's no logic, no rationality. Just a bunch of people who care more about their guns more than they care their fellow citizens. 

So they downplay it. Look for these responses:

""It's not a big problem, not enough people die, it's too small-time""

""We already have too many regulations, they obviously don't help""

And the worst of all:

""Maybe if there had been a few more guns in that classroom things wouldn't have been so bad""

When we look back on segregationists and the logical leaps they made to justify their positions, it seems insane. But they had to. If those were humans they were hurting, that would make them bad people. So they decided they weren't humans. They were just niggers. And here you have the same thing. If they were complicit in murder that would make them bad people. So they decide one of the above arguments. Hopefully in the future people will look back on them the way we look back on segregationists. ",1,0,1443824625,1444717652
