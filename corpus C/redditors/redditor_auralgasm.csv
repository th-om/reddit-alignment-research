Terrace has everything. It has a big open space for people who like movement, a really campy middle for people who love to camp, and a couple ways around both for people who like to sneak around. I can't see what else you'd want in a map unless you REALLY love camping, in which case just cross your fingers and hope for Instinct to pop up in the next voting block.",1,0,1444680058,1444720888

I kinda agree with this. I'm a woman and I've only ever complained about a bathroom once, and that was because it was at a hospital and I figured it was important for a hospital bathroom to be clean. Otherwise I just mind my own business and leave, even if I couldn't find a single clean stall.

The worst bathroom I ever saw was one where an entire stall was full of mounds of shitty toilet paper, the toilet seat was smeared with shit, the walls were smeared with shit, and someone had LEFT THEIR PANTS ON THE FLOOR. Also covered in shit. I have no idea what they even wore out of there. I didn't tell anyone. >_>",33,0,1444671114,1444720888

That's fine with me cuz I accept that some people hold different views than me; the only person who holds the exact same set of opinions as me IS me. To demand anything else is to become a reverse SJW. I can still enjoy his show, I just roll my eyes now and then.",52,0,1444590093,1444720888
cvvzy4y,0,t1_cvvvg04,auralgasm,"Hey, that happened to me once. 6 months later I spotted them with the same survey promising the same fake bonus and shot them a message saying it didn't seem very ethical to me, and they bonused me a couple days later claiming it was an oversight. So I guess occasionally it helps to write. I wonder if this was the same requester? Was it a 2 part survey with a ""bonus"" for the second part?",2,0,1444586240,1444720888

People get really angsty looking at Russia going in and making waves. They feel like we're being left out and like we have to do SOMETHING just to assert that we're still here. But in reality, this is just Russia's quagmire now. Ukraine is their Afghanistan and Syria is their Iraq. We have proven time and time again that when we intervene, we just get bogged down in some crap conflict we never really had a stake in in the first place, and we also create massive blowback we have to deal with years -- even decades -- down the road.",6,0,1444555622,1444720888
