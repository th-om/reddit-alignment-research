cvtsnci,0,t1_cvtp0ta,Malcolmthrowaway,"Let me give you an alternative - what if the GOP moderates side with the Democrats to elect a Democrat Speaker? With McCarthy and Boehner both out, there is no clear front runner. Assuming for the sake of the argument that neither the moderates nor the Freedom Caucus are able to find a consensus candidate, DNC votes become a requirement. In that situation, why would Pelosi not simply withold the DNC's support until the moderates decide on an acceptable Democrat to back for Speaker? ",1,0,1444405806,1444723572
cvsgqn0,0,t1_cvs91ia,Malcolmthrowaway,"Going with some easy examples - abortion and drone strikes. 

With abortion, there's no objective answer to the question: ""when should the personhood rights of a fetus at some stage of development supersede the agency of a woman to get an abortion?"" Science can *inform* your answer to that question, but at its core it is a moral determination. Two reasonable people can look at the same evidence, and draw different conclusions.

With drone strikes, copying something from my other comment:

> For my final project in my ""War and Politics"" seminar, I did cross-tab analyses on the effect that drone strikes had on the rate of incidents of political violence in the FATA areas of Pakistan. To my surprise there was a negative relationship - as drone strikes increased, political violent incidents decreased. Now, what do we do with that from a policy perspective?

Objectively, the evidence might seem to be in favor of drone strikes in that context for that policy goal. But does that make it morally right? Again, reasonable people can come to differing conclusions. 

> Our two party system has created so much of a divide that compromises are completely separate from what anyone thinks will actually work.

I would argue that at any given point in US history, someone disenfranchised with the politics of the two mainstream parties in the country could and did make this argument. 

I'll not deny we're in a period of exceptional dysfunction. But we've been through periods of polarization before. Hell, we've fought a civil war over one. But above all else our system is designed to be enduring and I would argue it does a good job of that.",1,0,1444312683,1444723572
cvsgdgn,0,t1_cvs8ct3,Malcolmthrowaway,"Look, I don't disagree that we have a problem with politicians denying evidence. But we're talking about two different things - policy making addresses **both** evidence-based issues and moral-based issues, and issues that involve some cross-section of the two. 

When it comes to things like climate change, or nuclear power - those are issues that tend to lend themselves to quantifiable, pro/con cost analyses and risk projections. On those I completely sympathize with your frustrations. 

But take an issue like abortion or the use of drones. For the former, it's clearly a moral question - do you personally consider a fetus (at some stage of development) a person whose rights are worth superseding those of the mother's choice to get an abortion? Science doesn't help you with that one.

Now for one more complex - drone strikes. For my final project in my ""War and Politics"" seminar, I did cross-tab analyses on the effect that drone strikes had on the rate of incidents of political violence in the FATA areas of Pakistan. To my surprise there was a negative relationship - as drone strikes increased, political violent incidents decreased. Now, what do we do with that from a policy perspective? The evidence seems to support the program, while moral considerations go against it. 

>   I firmly believe we need an objective-as-possible scientific backbone leading the policy-making of congress.

That would be ideal. But your idealism needs to be tempered with a recognition of the moral elements of policy making, and how reasonable people can come to differing opinions.

> we should be working towards that instead of trying to create policy in a system that is old and corrupted.

I think once you understand the moral elements of policy making, you can gain a greater appreciation for our system despite its flaws. Our system was designed to be enduring - it facilitates constant conflict between two political factions that generates incremental progressive change. The motto of our country could be ""three steps forward, two steps back"". It may be frustrating to deal with the stresses and conflicts we produce, but in the long run there's something to be said for the way we do things.",1,0,1444312016,1444723572

I completely agree with your desired *process*, that is:

but I disagree with your implication that there is an objective (albeit, as you say, imperfect) answer to each question policy makers face. They deal in many, many broad shades of grey. I am with you on that the two party system generates many shitty outcomes, but I think for the most part we do our society a discredit when this is what we focus on. Conflict and compromise, incremental progressivism of our federal structure - I believe you can make an argument that our system does in fact serve the purposes our founders had in mind.

Theoretically yes, in practice no. I believe there's a certain type of legislative veto provision that the Court ruled was unconstitutional, but the ruling has been blatantly ignored. There's a couple of other examples in the book, but basically whenever the Court rules on an issue that requires compliance by non-judicial actors for the opinion to have any effect, deference to the perceived legitimacy of the Court is the determining factor in whether or not the ruling is followed. So if public opinion shifts on an issue, the likelihood of non-judicial compliance increases or decreases. ",1,0,1442961951,1444723572
