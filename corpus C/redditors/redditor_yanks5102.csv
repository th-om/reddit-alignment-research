The one before the sunset cruise is a wine tasting one. They looked pretty sloshed getting off the boat if that's more their thing.

cvaqybl,1,t3_3lwb8z,yanks5102,"If you're prepared to fail then fuck yeah saddle up. I'm not saying you will, but it's very possible. By fail I mean broke nowhere to live and a job that can't pay bills as fast as they come. At that point you leave and never speak of it again. 

You won't get an apartment on your own. You'll need to find roommates. Take any job you can when you get here before even worrying about your music. If you're not applying/working you should be in a high visibility park playing with your case open. 

You'll need a few thousand to start honestly. It'll go quick and with nothing coming in initially it's a scary feeling. 

Yes 8.whatever million people live here. A large amount of them are not exactly thrilled their lives while the top end couldn't find a better place live. 

Welcome to New York man! Glad to have ya!!",1,0,1442962786,1444727214
