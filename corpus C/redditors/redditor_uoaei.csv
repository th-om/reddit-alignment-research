cvux143,0,t1_cvuwcuz,uoaei,Some people have weird geometry. I wouldn't say it's impossible but some have to work on their balance / certain muscle groups a lot more than others. I personally have relatively long legs and a short torso so I need to work on my ankle flexibility a LOT just to keep my weight over my feet. Dem soleus muscles and hamstrings really need to be loose in my case.,10,0,1444497003,1444729553

cvsaifa,0,t1_cvs98ox,uoaei,"If it's hitting the sun, it doesn't have enough energy to orbit the sun. Remember the classic phrase: ""Orbiting is falling toward an object and missing it continuously."" If you don't miss it, you're not orbiting.

Try starting on an axis (say, the positive x-axis) and giving Mars a velocity equal to sqrt(G*(M1+M2)*((2/r)-(1/a))), where G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two bodies, r is the current distance between them, and a is the maximum distance between them. See what you get.",3,0,1444293544,1444729553
