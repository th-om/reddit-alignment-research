cvww4wf,0,t1_cvwtcss,JimMarch,"Because if this is the case that criminals still get guns, gun control becames a matter of making sure armed criminals have plenty of unarmed victims.

That's just wrong on all levels. *Self defense is a basic human right.*

Here's the other part you're missing.  Criminals gain more (economically speaking) from their guns than most non-criminals get from theirs (with rare exceptions such as competition shooters, security guards, etc.).  So if the criminal has more to gain, they'll go to greater lengths to score a gun...eventually you get underground gun *factories*, such as in the Philippines.  *So every single thing you do to make guns ""harder to get"" is destructive to society because it further fucks up the imbalance between armed criminals and unarmed victims.*

The only reason this hasn't become brutally obvious by now is the (fortunate?) fact that most murders in the US involve one crook killing another.  

Want to see our violence rates shrink dramatically?  End most of the drug prohibitions.  But, if we do that, prisons shrink plus the public push for gun control will also shrink, and in some circles those are both bad things.",8,0,1444657577,1444716760

Please listen.  Their safety scores are in the toilet, they have lost major contracts and their trucks are sitting too much.  Also nasty: your pay goes to the truck, split 50/50 with your co-driver no matter how lazy he is.  $600/wk is a pipe dream.
