What if their work is not worth a living wage?  Structural unemployment is going to hit our economy like a freight train.  It's best to be prepared for the world where it is cheaper for society to just pay people to stay home rather than drag them to a job they don't like to produce a product that is not worth the time they spend on it.

> People should earn enough to live on, so that they can survive to go to work the next day.

So McDonalds will have to pay the single mom more than the teenager who still lives at home?

Tax the people making the money rather than the business entity. Increase dividend and capital gains tax rates.

> A flat percentage tax for infrastructure usage (or whatever) still disproportionally affects the poor and small businesses.

Why do you say this?  Also, infrastructure usage has nothing to do with corporate profit.",1,1,1444698408,1444728754

cvxfao5,0,t1_cvxd69e,work_but_on_reddit,"> My needs are not fulfilled by my employer.

Pre-Obamacare, no one would give me health insurance unless I was on an employer-sponsored group plan. I would have loved to go into business for myself, but I could only do it by risking personal bankruptcy over medical bills. I view a very high  minimum wage in the same light. There is no middle ground between $15/hour and $0/hour, and the risk of going from 15 to zero is big enough that many people won't feel comfortable looking for new work.

In both of these cases, I think that the Government mandating employer-provided benefits make employees unduly reliant on their employers. I would much rather have the government supply these services to people who need them, and then employment can be considered a way of getting above that baseline.

Who would you rather have guaranteeing minimum standards of living for the country: the Federal Government or McDonald's?  I find it very similar to slavery that so many of a person's basic needs are coming from their employer. ",1,1,1444682993,1444728754

Businesses already pay payroll taxes, gas taxes, healthcare taxes and sales taxes.  Corporate profits are taxed whenever shareholders get a dividend or sell shares.  These are very easy ways to tax a corporation.  Taxing corporate profits is a hard way to tax a corporation, and mostly just encourages them to figure out how to re-incorporate in a more tax-friendly country. In addition, corporate taxes are regressive in the sense that smaller, more local companies don't have the size and legal resources to play the same tax games the larger corps do.  All in all, this is the single worst way to make a company ""pay its fair share"".",1,1,1444682610,1444728754

The vitamin is made from bacteria, and stored in animal tissues. It is easy to get it directly from the bacteria without bothering with the meat/dairy. Supplements work, but also eating certain very specific sea plants and fermented products work as well.  I guess these foods aren't ""easily obtainable"" in your perspective.

> You'd need to get injections afaik.

Plenty of vegans have fine levels of b12 without injections. You just need to be mindful of occasionally taking a very cheap oral supplement.
