cvxi0am,1,t3_3oi8mh,SuffragetteCinci,"This is what happens when the party in power has absolute control of redistricting.  Our state house is 65% Republican, and the Supreme Court is 85% Republican.  Where I live in Cincinnati, the political voice of the people who live in the city proper is effectively nullified on the nation level, because bizarre-looking district lines offset their votes with huge chunks of rural areas.  Despite the city having a fairly strong democratic leaning in municipal elections, Steve Chabot is one of the longest serving members of the House. 

Vote for issue 1.  Maybe it will survive the inevitable legal challenges, but even if it does, nothing is going to change for another FIVE GODDAMN YEARS. ",10,0,1444691496,1444730136

It is the story of a family of naive missionaries who move to the Congo and are not ready for it at all, written as a series of diary entries.  It has a lot to say about colonization, human nature, and the wrath of God. ",10,0,1444354682,1444730136

It's a beautiful and simple portrait of South Africa during WWII,  as racial and economic tensions were rising, which hindsight tells us would lead to the rise of afrikaaner nationalism and the worst abuses of apartheid.
