cvxj2n6,0,t1_cvx9sam,Nanotchka,"I don't know it works in the UK, but here in the US I'd suggest seeing your GP to see what he/she thinks. They'll refer to you a specialist if they think it's necessary.",1,1,1444693234,1444723653
cvxdeva,0,t1_cvx81p4,Nanotchka,"Only if they're shitty. You go in and you say ""unexplained rapid weight gain"" and they'll know a few things to check for. One is pregnancy, yes, but they should also do bloodwork to check your levels of various hormones at a minimum.

It's one of those trigger phrases like ""worst headache of my life"" that usually gets doctors to sit up and pay attention.",1,1,1444684292,1444723653
cvx97b0,0,t1_cvx7lkq,Nanotchka,"A lot of things. Some are not a big deal, some are a larger deal. The likelihood is that it will not be a big deal, but there is no way for you or us to know that without be evaluated by a doctor. I'd make that appointment today. And let us know what happens!",1,1,1444678335,1444723653
cvx90jl,1,t3_3ohjw4,Nanotchka,"A few weeks ago I was home on a Saturday and started getting hungry. I was already starting to get that panicky feeling of ""uh oh, I don't know what to eat and I bet whatever I wind up with will be too much food..."" but I noticed I still had a leftover wrap from the work lunches I'd made that week.

So I ate that and stayed well within my plan. It was like this huge revelation, ""holy crap, I can continue to eat on the weekends the same way I do during the week."" 

Mostly you just need to change the way you think about weekends. Once you establish a new habit of eating at that time, the way you did for the work week, it'll feel natural.",1,1,1444678072,1444723653
cvx8sze,1,t3_3ogi07,Nanotchka,"Last week I went to my first yoga class. It was great, but definitely worked some muscles I haven't worked in a loonnnnnng time. The next day I had DOMS and a 3-lb weight gain on the scale. It didn't come off again until this morning. It was kind of a rough week psychologically because of that.",1,1,1444677762,1444723653
cvx8qv4,1,t3_3ofwzt,Nanotchka,"What I eat almost every day for lunch at work:

* Lo-carb wrap with lunch meat, a slice of cheese, bit of mustard, and romaine lettuce.
* two of the following: sliced strawberries, sliced bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, sliced apples.
* Greek yogurt OR cottage cheese ""Fruit doubler"" 

It's pretty satisfying with the fruit and veg and keeps me going until dinnertime.",1,1,1444677678,1444723653
cvx878x,1,t3_3ogsy5,Nanotchka,"My current plan is for 1350 calories per day. It is very, very difficult for me to snack with any kind of regularity and still be able to eat normal-sized meals at breakfast/lunch/dinner. So my advice would be to generally cut back on snacking and only eat when you're actually hungry.

That said, there are times I get actually hungry before mealtime. My go-to is cherry tomatoes or sliced bell peppers. Very lo-cal but filling and tasty. ",1,1,1444676891,1444723653
cvx7w6y,1,t3_3ohc75,Nanotchka,"I don't know if I can get to 25 things, but I'll share what I do have:

1. Drink hot tea (splenda-sweetened).
2. Go for a walk
3. Play video games
4. Watch TV 
5. Chat with husband
6. Go outside
7. Write
8. Hot bath 
9. Do toenails
10. Text my sister
11. Yoga
12. Read a book

OK, I guess I have 12! That's a pretty good representation of what I do when I'm feeling stressed out, though. They all help me in various ways.",1,1,1444676437,1444723653
cvx30sv,0,t1_cvx03c7,Nanotchka,"It's based on the advice in the book [The Depression Cure](http://www.amazon.com/The-Depression-Cure-Program-without/dp/0738213888) (fyi, the subtitle of that book is ""how to beat depression without drugs, but I ignore that part - antidepressants are an amazing tool if you need them)

Basically it comes down to:

* Regular exercise 
* Good sleep
* Fish oil supplementation
* SAD light
* Avoid rumination (circling over negative thoughts again and again)

I take 2400 mg of fish oil per day, year-round, and I have a goal of walking a minimum of 1 mile per day (I sometimes take a day off on the weekends but I'm trying to get out of that habit). Also, starting in early fall, I use my SAD light every morning for about 15 minutes, and also for as much time in the afternoon as I can get in. 

[This is the lamp I got.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WTCHLC) It's a little spendy but honestly for me it has been 1000% worth it.

Good luck. Last winter was one of the first ones in a long time that I didn't spend basically wanting to just die. ",1,1,1444669374,1444723653
