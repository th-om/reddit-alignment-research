cvx5wdl,0,t1_cvvwkuc,McSchwartz,"Honestly though, you could *always* say that a refugee fleeing violence is ""country shopping"" because they didn't choose the absolute poorest country in the world that wasn't an active war-zone.",1,0,1444673570,1444719162
cvx5blp,0,t1_cvw2uf8,McSchwartz,"Try taking the most civilized people on earth and lock them in a small area with a severe lack of basic necessities, no law enforcement or police to keep order, and poor sanitation. Then tell them they will never have a chance for a good future. See how few crimes they will commit.

You aren't ""forcing"" them to commit crimes, but you aren't exactly helping by creating those conditions.",0,0,1444672736,1444719162
cvwy3n9,0,t1_cvwwhn3,McSchwartz,"The hard question is: how do you distinguish between people who truly need the social safety net, and the people who have become overly dependent on it?",4,0,1444661408,1444719162

cvuawzx,0,t1_cvu9oxq,McSchwartz,"That proposed mechanism seems legit. I can't say I've heard of anything like it in a historical context. More statistics or surveys would be nice though.

If it were up to me, I would focus more on *deradicalizing* them. But it's your country.

I just don't like really exaggerated apocalyptic predictions of how bad this problem will get. It's not to say that it will be perfectly fine, but crazy predictions just hurt your credibility.

I think that people shouldn't lump you guys with actual racists. They're a tiny minority that just happen to support the same policies, but for the wrong reasons.",1,0,1444434771,1444719162
cvu92gj,0,t1_cvu8iu1,McSchwartz,"Ah. So focus on a good weapon. What about the invisibility cloak? I found that it's too easy to run out of juice, takes too long to recharge. What level should it be at?",1,0,1444431330,1444719162
cvu8wvu,0,t1_cvu1pzs,McSchwartz,"Wait, you say that the first generation will be more integrated, but the 2nd and 3rd will become less integrated and turn to radical religion? Why? Don't immigrants become more integrated over time? What mechanism is causing them to reverse? Any proof that this is statistically significant, and not just outliers?",1,0,1444431050,1444719162
