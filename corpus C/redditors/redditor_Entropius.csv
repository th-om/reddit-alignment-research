You don't have to endorse Huxley's views or terminology, but you should accommodate or tolerate it when others use it and there's sufficient reason to assume it's what they meant.

True, which only came to light (to me at least) after you cited a particular quote from him.  I always suspected Huxley was a weak agnostic, and not a strong agnostic, but 'till you provided that quote I never had proof.  (Thanks for that by the way.) 

And yet while it's true that Huxley was a weak agnostic, it's still not terribly relevant.  You can't deny other people like strong agnostics, or theists, or atheists from using Huxley's terminology.   Nobody has a monopoly on words.

> As you may or may not be aware, publicist announcing yourself as an atheist at the time he was in was like announcing you are a child molester today. But you want me to believe he would just happily shout to the world about his atheism if that's what he believed. Lol, that's just not the history.

He was known as “*Darwin's Bulldog*” for his advocacy of Darwin's theory of evolution.  His career also included debates with scientists, **clerics**, and **politicians** (the latter of which must be aligned with the religious majority to be electable).  [“*Huxley used the expression ""the so-called Christianity of Catholicism,"" explaining: ""I say 'so-called' not by way of offense, but as a protest against the monstruous assumption that Catholic Christianity is explicitly or implictly contained in any trust-worthy record of the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth.""*”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley)  He was putting himself out there, front and center to argue with this religious majority.  The dude clearly did not give a shit about pissing them off.

So not only do you have no evidence that he was secret-atheist (by his own definition of atheism at least), but you make this claim despite evidence to the contrary.

> ""The results of working out the agnostic principle will vary according to individual knowledge, and according to the general position of science. That which is unknown today may become known.

> So, once again, Huxley himself disagrees with you and completely leaves open the possibility of theistic or atheistic agnostics.

Nah, you're just trying to read between lines that aren't there.

I found the original quote, and you omitted part of it:

[“The results of the working out of the agnostic principle will vary according to individual knowledge **and capacity**, and according to the general condition of science. That which is unproved today may be proved, by the help of new discoveries, tomorrow. The only negative fixed points will be those negations which flow from the demonstrable limitation of our faculties. And the only obligation accepted is to have the mind always open to conviction.”](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/890535-agnosticism-in-fact-is-not-a-creed-but-a-method)

He's just saying people with different knowledge or capacity can apply the agnostic principle to arrive at new answers.  But he doesn't actually say that those other answers are Agnosticism.

They'd just be Theism or Atheism that was obtained by by applying the agnostic principle with more data and intelligence than they had in his time.  

You seem married to this idea that agnosticism and the agnostic principle go hand in hand.  They don't.  And your failure to grasp that is why you're tripping yourself up here.







> You said belief if God is incompatible with Huxleys agnosticism, which says you know 100% what science is going to prove in the future

* Belief in god is compatible with Huxley's agnostic principle.

* Belief in god is **in**compatible with Huxley's Agnosticism.

* I never claimed that Huxley's agnosticism says you know 100% what since in the future is going to be.  You're trying to get away with a strawman argument.  Huxley is what we today call a weak-agnostic, not a strong-agnostic.

> Using Huxleys definitions, you can in fact be an atheist agnostic, or theist agnostic. Sorry if that bothers you, but I don't know what why you think in 2015 we should be locked into 18th century definitions no one uses anymore.

1.  The 18th century is from 1701–1800.  Huxley was born in 1825 and died in 1895.   So he's actually 19th century, and you're off by a hundred years.

2. Many self-described agnostics still use it to this day.

3.  Your first and second sentence there implicitly contradict one another.  You want to attack Huxley's definitions as being outdated… yet you claim his definitions are in-line with modern ones that involve “*agnostic-atheist*” or “*agnostic-theist*”?

Except that it's not *just* the scientific method.  It's also the position one holds after applying the scientific method to religion.

Except that you haven't been specific… you just re-asserted your previous claim without specifically pointing to a quote I've written that it would contradict.  I'm guessing you haven't because you can't.  And now you want to shift the burden of proof by saying “*it's up to you to explain*”.

Because he did in fact use the narrower definition of atheism.

> Why should anyone care? You haven't explained that yet.

Because it establishes precedence to the version of agnosticism that has a narrower definition of atheism, which agnostics use to this day.  It's a thing, whether you like it or not.

> If you ask terrible, obnoxious questions like that when you are not incensed then it's actually much much worse. It's this type of thing you've been doing since the start that gave away how intellectual dishonest you are choosing to be. 

I recommend you give up on the personal attacks and refocus your efforts on offering a substantive argument.  Because if you don't, it'll just make it look like you can't.

> Lol, except you told me you can't believe in God and use science. 

Obvious strawman fallacy.  I never claimed that.  And this is in fact part of the reason I told you earlier that Agnosticism isn't merely just the scientific method, but rather a particular position that ought to result from the scientific method being applied to religion.

>  If you use science to believe in God, that not a contradiction and you haven't shown it to be

If people could use science to believe in a god, I think that would have made the evening news.  Nobody has constructed an experiment to prove god.  Therefore god remains unfalsifiable.

> Nope, haven't yet responded to it at all. 

Yes I have responded.  The problem is it's not the answer you want to hear, an answer which gives a pass to the false premise that the question attempts to establish: The premise that your Atheism and his Atheism are the same thing.  They're likely not.  

He said he has “*neither art nor part*” with atheism.  Therefore he's not an atheist, according his definition of atheism.  Maybe under your preferred definition of atheism (the most inclusive version, mere absence of belief) he would be an atheist, but that's not the version of atheism his agnosticism was designed around.


Furthermore, the quotes I offered did establish that he lacks 

I think this is around the 3rd time I've had to correct you for trying to conflate Huxley's version of Atheism with your version of Atheism.  They're not necessarily the same, so stop pretending that they are.

> What I said was, Huxley chose not to identify as an atheist, but in absolutely zero, let me say that again, zero of the quotes that you gave did he say exactly whether he had either positive or negative beliefs in God.

He has neither positive nor negative positions for theism or atheism (his narrower version of it at least).   He's [been critical of both theism and atheism.](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/Rdetc/AgnAnn.html)  He clearly said that he has [“*neither art nor part*”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism#Thomas_Henry_Huxley) with either of them.  I'm having trouble figuring out if you just have trouble understanding what he wrote, or if you refuse to acknowledge it for some other reason, but it really isn't hard to read.

> I'm going to say it again, like Huxley did again and again, agnosticism is a method, not a creed. 

I already explained this to you, how can you be so forgetful?  Creed typically has religious connotations.  He's not religious.  And he called himself Agnostic.  Hence his agnosticism isn't a creed.  This isn't complicated stuff so I wonder why you have so much trouble with it.

> It is the scientific method, which is employed by atheists all the time and obviously not incompatible.

Theists and atheists can use the scientific method, **but Huxley's Agnosticism isn't merely the scientific method, it's also a position he thinks ought to result from the method.** (neither true, nor false, just “*results inconclusive*”).  Theists and Atheists (by his definition of atheist) don't arrive at the same position that he did, therefore he would say they can't be Agnostic because they got the answer wrong.

[I've already had to explain to you before that it's not just the scientific method, but also a position and resulting from it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3oa6l2/thirty_orphanages_run_by_the_group_founded_by/cvwjd05)  But apparently you've either willfully disregarded or forgotten this explanation.   And yet you accuse *me* of ignoring you?   :-)


> You have used false strawman to make claims like science could never prove the existence of God (something you have no idea about, but accept as fact and relay it as fact).

1.  To accuse me of strawmanning implies that I strawmanned somebody in particular.  Who did I strawman?… and be specific.

2. Actually you're making bad extrapolations from what I said, which are in effect strawmans themselves against me. (projection anyone?)

3. The idea you seem so opposed to is actually a position called [strong agnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism#Types).  Of course Huxley isn't a strong agnostic ([because he's open to god potentially being falsifiable someday](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/890535-agnosticism-in-fact-is-not-a-creed-but-a-method)), but I never claimed he was a strong agnostic to begin with.

> Yet to support your point, you claim that belief in a God is incompatible with Huxelys atheism because you still don't understand what he's saying. All someone has to do is believe science and the evidence shows there is a God, and you immediately become a theist and an agnostic.

Yet another argument arising from the false premise that Agnosticism is merely the scientific method, and not also the position that Huxley thinks one ought to arrive at after applying the scientific method.

> To deny this you don't make a claim about Huxley, what you did was make a claim about the universe and that God can never be shown.

No, you created a strawman that pretends I made a claim about the universe and that a god can never be shown. 

> How do you know that? Prove please? 

I don't, you're just pretending that I claimed to.  Strawman.

> Agnosticism is not a creed, but a method, and you must be a real genius of the world to be able to tell me the absolute truth about all that method will ever reveal.

Again, Agnosticism is not a creed because it's not religious, and creeds are typically religious.  Agnosticism includes a method, but goes further to prescribe what Huxley thinks is the correct answer to application of that method, a position that is neither theism nor atheism.

> Huxley clearly says, he wants to be defined by his methods and knowledge, not his beliefs.

You're ignoring that he also thinks application of this method results in a specific position that can't be theism or atheism.

> This doesn't remove the meaning of the word atheist because he didn't put it on his business card. Guess what? 

The fact that he explicitly said that he had “*neither art nor part*” with atheism is why it's not on his business card.

> There are actually scientists today who believe in God, and prefer to still be called scientists! 

Of course, and many do a great job at physics, chemistry, biology, etc.  But Huxley wouldn't call them Agnostics because they used the scientific on their religion and got the wrong answer:  an answer other than “*results inconclusive*”

> Except you are making this up lol. You have no idea what he would refer to his beliefs as, because he made it clear he wanted to be known by his methods. 

Except that I do know what he would refer to his beliefs as because it's one of the first things I quoted to you:  [“When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an **atheist**, a **theist**, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that **I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations**, except the last”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism#Thomas_Henry_Huxley)

> Doesn't matter

How can you say that doesn't matter?  The Huxley quote clearly demonstrates that his agnosticism is incompatible with belief.  Again:  [“It simply means that a man shall **not say** he knows **or believes** that which he **has no scientific grounds** for professing to know or believe”.](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/Rdetc/AgnAnn.html)  You can't get scientific proof of god, so belief is out of the question for his brand of agnosticism.  Therefore your claim that [“you can use Huxleys method of agnosticism and **still believe** or not believe in god or gods.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3oa6l2/thirty_orphanages_run_by_the_group_founded_by/cvvwrb4) is false.  You can't believe in gods under Huxley Agnosticism.

> If you want me to think you understand my point you'll have to respond to it instead of restating yourself as though I've typed nothing. You are not getting anywhere, and you are going in circles.

I'm pretty sure I've understood and aptly responded to your point.  If you want to continue claiming otherwise, then perhaps you need to do a significantly better job explaining your point.


> Because you were incensed […] 

So I'm supposedly “*incensed*” now…?  That would be news to me.  Do you try to mischaracterize the emotions of everyone who disagrees with you, or just the ones that you can't mount a substantive rebuttal against?

> […] that I characterized agnosticism like this

> > ""You can be atheist and agnostic. Agnosticism say you can't know for sure' atheism needs at least a lack of belief.""

Actually no, I never objected to your characterizing agnosticism that way.  It's a popular and accepted definition.  I just wanted to amend (not contradict it) it with a clarification that it's not the *only* way to define agnosticism (and atheism).  It seems you've misunderstood the purpose of why I wrote that first comment this entire time.

Because I've never claimed that broader definitions of atheism are wrong or don't exist.

cvwjd05,0,t1_cvwhty3,Entropius,"> His agnosticism is only a method. This method could reveal God, so no, it's not incompatible on its own at all.

His agnosticism includes a method, but it's also a position / worldview that's informed by the method.

* [“Some twenty years ago, or thereabouts, I invented the word ""Agnostic"" to denote people who, like myself, confess themselves to be hopelessly ignorant concerning a variety of matters, about which metaphysicians and theologians, both orthodox and heterodox, dogmatise with the utmost confidence; and it has been a source of some amusement to me to watch the gradual acceptance of the term and its correlate, ""Agnosticism"" (I think the Spectator first adopted and popularised both), **until now Agnostics are assuming the position of a recognised sect**, and Agnosticism is honoured by especial obloquy on the part of the orthodox. Thus it will be seen that I have a sort of patent right in ""Agnostic"" (it is my trade mark); and I am entitled to say that I can state authentically what was originally meant by Agnosticism.”](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/Rdetc/AgnAnn.html)

> Except that he at that time rejected identifying with beliefs, and instead went with identifying with a method.

You're attempting to conflate any position/worldview with belief/creed.  A belief or creed typically has religious connotation, and that's why he rejects belief or creeds.  Not because they're a position/worldview.

> He didn't explocit reject atheism in the quote you game at all, he rejected labelling himself as that. Big difference. 

1. Of course he rejected what he considered to be atheism… otherwise you're implying that he'd label himself with a term that he doesn't actually hold with which requires some hardcore mental gymnastics to justify.  

2. He's literally said “*When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist*”.  He makes no attempt to distinguish “*what he is*” versus “*what he labels himself*”.

3.
