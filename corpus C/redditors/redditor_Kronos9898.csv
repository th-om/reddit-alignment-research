cvrvhdu,0,t1_cvrqx2s,Kronos9898,"Yes..... Notify the hospital while being shot at from people inside the hospital (if we are working on the assumption that the Taliban where in the hospital). So then assuming that you don't die getting to the hospital, you then just told the enemy that you are calling in CAS on their position.....",3,0,1444260111,1444718482
cvqgoqp,0,t1_cvq4i8a,Kronos9898,Is he duel citizenship? Then you could argue that maybe both countries get the credit. If he gave up his Irish citizenship though it kinda hard to make that argument. ,0,0,1444161408,1444718482

cvq7iqp,0,t1_cvq4qy6,Kronos9898,"I would not push the US recovery too hard. Our labor participation rate is the same is  what is was during the 70's, hardly a good economic time for the US. It's also important to note that the US does not count those people who have stopped looking for jobs towards its unemployment rate, and long term unemployment in the US is at one if its highest points ever. Our economic situation is much more fragile than it would appear just looking at our unemployment numbers.

Most of our economic growth was also tied to the shale gas boom, and now that the price of oil has collapsed, that is going away now as well. Those jobs where also not the result of stimulus money.

The stimulus packages saved the banks and Wall Street. While this undoubtedly staved off an even worse economic crisis, it has not returned the US to pre-collapse economic health. Political turmoil in Asia and Europe has also maintained the dollar as the world's most reliable currency, which has also helped the American economy. Remember, there was that brief period in 2007-2008 where people where predicting the Euro would overtake the Dollar

Tldr; The American economy is not chugging along just fine because of stimulus packages.",6,0,1444148056,1444718482
