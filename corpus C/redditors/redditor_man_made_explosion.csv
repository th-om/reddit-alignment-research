If it was public opinion that pushed either abortion clinics or gun stores out of the area, that's one thing, but creating regulatory frameworks that make these things defacto unavailable to people of lesser means (who are honestly probably the ones who need access the most) is fucked up. IMHO. ",1,0,1444063590,1444723061
cvoqaxx,0,t1_cvomqqi,man_made_explosion,"What if you had to take a day trip to partake in your hobby of choice? Do you think you would be able to enjoy that as much?

What if you needed to take a day trip to get safety measures installed in your car? Do you think you would have as safe of a vehicle?

What if you had to take a day trip to buy condoms? Do you think you would enjoy and have safe sex as much?

Just something interesting to think about. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm surprised a gun store has lasted this long in SF, due to the combination of rising land prices, public perception, and regulatory pressure, but to say that a day trip is trivial is pretty ignorant. I mean, we are in an age where I literally take day trips to San Francisco from outside the state... ",-1,0,1444032765,1444723061
