Democratic congresses have passed climate legislation, have funded solar and wind R&D and investment, passed policy so that you get 30% off to put solar on your roof, in states run by Democrats they force utilities to buy more power from clean energy sources like hydro, solar, geothemal, wind power etc. California now has a 50% clean energy mandate.",1,0,1443152824,1444723580
