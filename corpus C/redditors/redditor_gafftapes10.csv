cvx4jhr,0,t1_cvwsklx,gafftapes10,If you get fired for no cause right after refusing to do something illegal then the company will have regulatory agencies breathing down their neck.  And chances are if you can fired because of it they have other things that are shady happening and the company getting a full audit by a government agency is not a goodtime for them.  And you will still probably win a wrongful termination suit.,-1,0,1444671624,1444724158

cvrzw6i,1,t3_3nv7m2,gafftapes10,"Why are you nervous?  people that matter don't mind, and people that mind don't matter.  Being out is a great source of relief, unless you live in an area that would become hell if you were out.  In that case try and find a way out and to a new area that is more accepting.   Honestly in most cases the anticipation of coming out is worse than actually coming out.

Being out allows you to normalize the feelings you have, and you stop questioning those feelings.  Having a boyfriend and being out seems completely normal to me anymore.  ",1,0,1444267385,1444724158

Also much of the violence was because there is an ongoing armed conflict with paramilitary forces like farc for the last half century.

I think sanders is important to keep somebody like clinton on their toes, but I would rather have him in the senate than the oval office.  I would vote for a moderate republican, but ones that support gay marriage are exceptionally rare.  ",2,0,1443795869,1444724158
