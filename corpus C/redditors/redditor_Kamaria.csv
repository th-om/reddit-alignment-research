Sorry, legitimately not watched the product in months, surprised a lot by this.",4,0,1444709274,1444720244

cvxh0e4,0,t1_cvxfcyu,Kamaria,"A lot of them are getting 0 minute promos or promos where they must follow the script to the letter. Hell, even if you shine in the ring they can admonish you for that. I recall when Mr. Kennedy did a shoot saying that they essentially told him to stop doing everything that got him over. ",38,0,1444689873,1444720244

I'm not saying it will get THAT bad (your post is a bit of hyperbole) but changes like these come slowly.

cvx2gjg,0,t1_cvwnrni,Kamaria,"I bet you could bypass it if you made some kind of program that 'scrambles' the video when it's uploaded and distribute some kind of a browser plugin that unscrambles the image. Say, dividing it up into 16 squares and shuffling them around and the plugin knows how to unshuffle it. For further security, you could use a distributed 'key' along with random shuffling.
