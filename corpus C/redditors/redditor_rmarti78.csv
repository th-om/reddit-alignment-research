cuvkex5,1,t3_3k8jhr,rmarti78,"He's indecisive in nearly every question he gets on the trail or in debates. If you or anyone else has ever watched Veep, he's the living embodiment of Lennon Parham's character. He's too afraid to take an actual position on anything for fear of pissing anyone off or he's too ignorant to be knowledgeable of issues to take a position. Either way, that's really bad for someone that wants to be president.",19,0,1441806577,1444731310

cutlx7y,0,t1_cutlr3e,rmarti78,"Seems like only the real old-timers are familiar with it. The vast majority of people don't have older relatives that lived in Waxhaw before they, so it's not that well-known. Makes you wonder how many other weird stories like that have happened across the country in little rural towns (population of Waxhaw back in the '60s had to be like 500-1000 people total).",2,0,1441647231,1444731310

cutiv11,0,t1_cutgv2w,rmarti78,"Back in the early '60s, a farmer named Helms and his wife disappeared without a trace. Around the same time, some livestock from another nearby farm went missing and some were found brutally killed. No one knows what happened, but a couple of kids claimed they saw a weird creature in the woods around the same time. 

This one isn't online, but I read about it in a book about Waxhaw history and remember talking to the librarian and someone at the Andrew Jackson museum who both said they remembered it.",2,0,1441641595,1444731310

cugcjel,1,t3_3ih6bq,rmarti78,Been visiting this subreddit for a long time and I've defended basically everything that has been posted. Not sure I can say the same for this one. This motherfucker posted this just so it could be posted places like this and people could pay attention to him and talk about him. He's an attention-seeking whore of the absolute worst kind.,156,0,1440603546,1444731310
cuf8y5s,1,t3_3i9s9y,rmarti78,Would you be willing/able to put down 6 or 12 months worth of rent upfront? I used to work for a company that did background checks and credit checks on prospective tenants for property owners and this was the most common way people got around bad credit. Of course it would be a shit ton worth of money you would have to have.,1,0,1440522366,1444731310
