cvqy04j,1,t3_3nso9n,Palidane7,"Here's the way I see it: America *is* exceptional. Right now, America is the most powerful country in the world, while every single other country *isn't*. That's unique and remarkable, and there must be reasons for it. I'm fine with historians and political and social scientists doing research and trying to figure out what factors led to our global hegemony and what specifically sets us apart. Just as I'd be fine with them poring over the records and speculating why Rome was the greatest empire of their age, and what made them so much better than their enemies.

American exceptionalism is real, but entirely academic. Nobody should be saying ""America is special and chosen, so therefore we can do no wrong!"" Extrapolating future prosperity from past success is stupid. Sure, we're on top of the world now, but that doesn't mean we can't make mistakes.",25,0,1444190809,1444724278

What kind of argument was that? Hey, if you save millions of lives, a few thousand people will die, and the crime rate will probably go up. Oh, and people might have less kids. Great, I'll take it, fantastic. You are arguing that we should straight up murder millions of people *because it's conveniant.* As if the best way to fight crime and poverty is to kill babies. I don't even have *words* to describe that kind of mindset.",-1,0,1443232288,1444724278

cvdh3og,0,t1_cvdgmyh,Palidane7,"This...doesn't sound like much of an argument. You're saying that the only reason Republicans want to oppose abortion is because they are not thinking? From their perspective, they are fighting to end mass murder. Do you think only a person who isn't thinking would consider a baby a person?",11,0,1443158906,1444724278
cvdh19y,0,t1_cvddvzu,Palidane7,"The first two points are true, and most of your third is as well, assuming no further action is taken by the Republicans.

What you're missing is the millions of people who would have died and will now live, which is the only reason any Republican wants to outlaw abortion, whether you agree with them or not. You came in to a thread asking for the Republican perspective, gave a bunch of downsides the Democrats love to talk about, and completely failed to address what the Republicans actually want.",-2,0,1443158717,1444724278
