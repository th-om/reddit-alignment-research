But the answer to those points was always fairly simple: just expand medicaid to cover anyone who fits your 1 or 2. In other words *just cover the few million who need coverage* as opposed to turning the whole system on its head.

Here in new york city (Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc) they are finally building more, huge, super TALL buildings = hundreds of thousands of new units. This is a good thing, for the most part. There was some opposition, but they didn't really stand a chance. The only real beef is that they aren't low-income units, but thankfully they're just building the best buildings they can, and renting/selling to the highest bidder.

However, my in laws live in the suburbs, and developers have recently started building a hideous cluster of 3,000 ""middle income units"" right on this main highway into the city, complete with strip mall and starbucks. A *huge* complex and it sits right at the corner of an intersection/light that shouldn't even be there (the only stoplight for miles and miles on a 55mph highway). The traffic there is a nightmare already, even on weekends: backups on slow days take 3 or 4 light cycles to get through the light, many more cycles in rush hour, with traffic backing up miles in either direction. The perpendicular streets are twisty, residential 25mph roads where commuters and trucks have been speeding through for years, trying to get around this idiotic traffic congestion. Multiple injuries and a couple of deaths have happened there. Bikers are hit all the time. Kids have been hit.

If you drove through this intersection your first reaction would be ""why is this fucking here???""

This particular intersection was the subject of almost every town hall meeting for years (and still is), with the public sentiment essentially being: spend the money to create a bridge/jughandle entrance/exit if we're to keep the intersection, or *block it off* because a) it's a 55mph road, and b) the intersection is superfluous = you can get to the same places, easily, using a proper exit a few miles to the left or right.

However, the town needed tax revenue! So they approved this crazy development that is totally at odds with the ""feel"" of the rest of the town (sleepy, big lots, nice middle class homes, great schools). Most of the reps got voted out the next election, but the approval was in. The damage was done.

Everyone freaked out. The local school even passed an ordinance banning any new students from being added from this particular ""zone"" - because they already have 30+ students per class in every grade– but they were overridden by the country. The estimate is about 500 new students k-12 into the existing system. Because the schools are ranked ""great"" the builders were going to pull out if they couldn't sell the units based on the quality of the school district. They can't clot in with another school district because the other districts are terrible. So now anyone in that good school can expect an influx of a shitton more kids, without any expansion of the school or staff. (Never mind that real estate shouldn't be tied in to schools, but that's another issue).

TL;DR: it depends on the situation. Some locales can handle it, others can't.",8,0,1443441771,1444719285
