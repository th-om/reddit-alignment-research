cvtp97a,0,t1_cvtohk8,SirPounceTheThird,"And many of them have a proven track record of failure. The FTT, for example, failed miserably in Sweden. And while he fancies himself a ""Scandinavian-style Socialist"", his neochartalist monetary policy, coupled with his super-protectionist and anti-business stances put him more in line with Latin American style socialists than Scandinavian ones.

A lot of the policies he is proposing work well in a homogeneous society, but won't work as well in one as varied as our own. For example, national $15 minimum wage. May work well in some cities, but will wreak havoc on suburbs and rural areas where the cost of living is incredibly low.

He also favors platitudes over thought-out policies. ""Money is not speech and corporations are not people"" is a lovely statement, until you think about what that actually entails. So corporations don't have the same rights as people? Guess that means the NSA can go ahead and access the files of any corporation without a warrant. Corporations have no right to free speech? Cool, lets ban the Sunlight Foundation from exposing public corruption, or Planned Parenthood from advertising any of their services. And spending money isn't a form of speech? Can we ban people spending money to buy signs and posters for candidates?

How about another one: ""I want to make public college free to all"". Sounds good up front, until you learn that he proposes to pay for it using the same FTT that Sweden tried, and failed, to implement back in the 80's. And his cost analysis was so amateur, it is unbelievable that he actually put it out. He literally took the total amount currently spent by college students (not including federal loans) and subtracted the number of federal grants given to all students. Lets ignore the fact that not including student loans in cost calculation already shifts the ""cost"" down to an unreasonable level. But does he honestly believe that making college ""free"" to the customer will not have any effect on demand?

Bernie Sanders is a populist. He tells people what they want to hear. Just because you like what you are hearing, doesn't mean that it will all work out. Platitudes make good politics, but they do not make good policies. ",12,0,1444400512,1444723139

>No one sees this as fair because ""hey, **I'm** not a terrorist or going to join a terrorist organization."" 

>No shit. The problem is that someone is. We don't ban drunk driving on a person by person basis, even though I guarantee certain people are more capable than others of handling their drink. 

>People who are in favour of domestic spying fully acknowledge that not everyone is about to plan a terrorist attack or go join ISIS. The point is that some people are, and the current rate of people doing it is so fucking high we'd rather no one had the ability to do it. 

>Is it a case of a small group of people ruining it for everyone? Absolutely. Welcome to public policy. Small groups of idiots are the reason we have such stringent food safety laws, drunk driving limits, OSHA guidelines, criminal sentencing and drug regulation.
