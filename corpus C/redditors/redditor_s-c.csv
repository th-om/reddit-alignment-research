cvuxzs2,1,t3_3o8k8c,s-c,"It depends on a *lot* of variables. 

Industry, revenue, expenses, profit, whether or not your process/product is proprietary, assets, level of automation, sustainability (in terms of $ and product longevity), and sometimes (for the sharks, at least) the qualities in the owners themselves.

The sharks tend to almost always lean towards undervaluing than full value, because they often state that just knowing them and having them involved is an increased non-monetary value. 

It can be incredibly complicated, and I suggest you read a book if you really want to know a lot more about business valuation. ",1,0,1444498693,1444725002

cvswp2m,0,t1_cvsvws2,s-c,"I think if that was the case, both the economic gain and economic efficiency would be marginalized. Youd likely see these underground jobs disappear, prices in those industries rise a little. 


What could happen (not an economist) is the legal low-skill Americans who couldn't find work before (due to being overvalued) may see more work. Emphasis on may. We're hoping that those jobs will still exist. 


If they do still exist, what's the value in hiring the American? The Mexican worker still would happily work there, except now they're making more. 


Side note, the gov't will likely collect more in taxes. 


I'm assuming you mean amnesty to the current group of illegals in U.S. If we legalize the ones currently here, suddenly they're just reclassified into the ""American"" category who had trouble with finding work because of the pricing floor (min wage). 


Cue more illegals?


Just some thoughts. ",3,0,1444336416,1444725002
cvsu1yu,1,t3_3nzewo,s-c,"Supply and demand.

The US has a demand for low-skill workers. 

With our minimum wage laws, we squeeze out many of these low-skilled workers because the value of their work is lower than minimum wage. Jobs that would exist without the minimum wage laws can be brought back with a supply of illegal Mexican workers. 

This is a benefit to the businesses that they work for, which pass o

n to customers (such as cheaper produce). This is negative to minimum wage earners in the same industry because their wages can't be lowered to the illegal's wages due to minimum wage laws. 

In Mexico, they have plenty of low-skilled labor. They don't need that much low-skilled labor, and they can't afford to maintain them all. The citizens that are interested in illegally working in the U.S. find their way here, work (producing value in the states) and then send some $$ home to family. This results in Mexico getting a *little* bit richer. 

This is good for Mexico because Mexico isn't paying to maintain those illegal workers in the states, and back home, the families are being elevated in terms of finances. 

The downside (I haven't thought enough about this from Mexico's POV) is, I'd suppose, general crime associated with the illegal immigration (Murders? Kidnapping? Of those citizens) and maybe something to do with population. Not entirely sure. ",3,0,1444332658,1444725002
