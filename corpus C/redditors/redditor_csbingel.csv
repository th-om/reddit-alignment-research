cvxp339,1,t3_3oh0sf,csbingel,"Key to any effective boss/worker relationship is trust in the ability to have honest conversations about this kind of stuff without fear or anger coming into play.  If I were in your shoes I would ask for a few minutes to talk to MB & DB (even if one or both are on the phone) about the issue.  Come prepared with a solution that you would be willing to accept (never point out a problem without offering a solution) and already have thought out beforehand what other options you would be open to.  (Compensatory pay, time bank, a cap on the amount of unpaid overtime you're willing to work, etc.)  

Also be prepared for them to react negatively.  Not everybody handles authority well.  If they do react poorly, take the high road and extricate yourself calmly, no matter how scared or angry you might be.  Give it a day or so for everyone to calm down, and bring the conversation up in a safe space.  Hopefully they'll apologize and have a calm conversation with you.  If not, know that you are being taken advantage of, and it's time to start looking at your options.  Good luck!",1,1,1444702650,1444722124
