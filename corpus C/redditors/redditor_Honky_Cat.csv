>So you are sleeping right. You wake up on a bed, all hooked up to me.

Is based upon the fact that the person being ""hooked up to"" did nothing to cause or enable being ""hooked up to""

Vs. the actual case being talked about here where the mother *chose* to engage in actions that *could* cause another person to be ""hooked up to"" her, knowing full well the risk that engaging in intercourse presents.

>If men are against abortion, why don't they collectively withhold sex? 

Your argument implies tha tall men are one group now, and should think and act as a hive-mind. This statement implies that not only are all men against abortion, that all men should act the same way if they are. 

>Why don't people who are against abortion petition men everywhere to withhold sex?
Why should they?

>I don't get this at all. If you don't trust women with the consequences of ""their behavior,"" why not actively campaign men everywhere to stop making pregnancies happen to begin with?

This argument has no point. Your argument implies that all men know that intercourse has a chance in resulting in pregnancy. (This nullifies any argumets about ""abstinence only"" education being a factor in the decision.) This argument also implies that women *do not* know that pregnancy is a possible outcome of sexual intercourse. Lastly, it implies that women really don't have a say in the matter of whether or not to have sex - it is being implied that men are walking around imposing their sexual will on women who would otherwise not have intercourse in the first place.

>I'm really missing the point on this, really.

As am I.

>Why isn't there a stronger national conversation about men withholding sex until they're in a secure relationship where a baby is wanted and can be provided for? 

Why isn't the same argument regarding women and sexual intercourse? Oh, that's right - because that would be incredibly sexist, and would be interpreted as ""slut shaming"", violating women's bodily sovereignty, and whatever other kooky arguments that the PC crowd could come up with.

On the flip side of that coin - it really is an argument that should be made towards *men AND women* in general. ""Can't afford a child? Don't engage in behavior where a child is a possible outcome!"" It's that fucking simple. 

Everything we do in life comes with risk. Playing football, driving a car, walking down the street - all come with multiple elements of risk. We all accept those risks every day. We know that the next time we get in a car could be our death ride - yet we do it anyway because the risk is relatively low.  Pregnancy is a risk with most contraceptives, yet we decide that the result of a pregnancy - a human life - is disposable for convenience sake.
