They will try to minimize the size of them, but even republicans can understand the need for a welfare system. We must also understand that the Republicans have a HUGE base. This ranges from libertarian (Justin Amash) to more moderate (Mccain). We have the religious (Huckabee), the establishment (Cantor), tea party (Ted Cruz). On top of that, we have so many groups.  Also so many god damn conspiracy theorist that have thrown themselves into the tea party. I hate having to deal with then when I work on campaigns. No, Obama is not muslim, no he is not working with isis. No, your conservative candidate is not a secret Democrat because he comprised on one bill. No it is not your congressman fault that your citys elected officials bankrupted the town. AND NO, The factory that shut down was not because of the congressman. It was because it was poorly managed.",3,0,1443977198,1444719395
