cvupt66,0,t1_cvub4di,ChrisDeg87-2,I started after doing several puzzles as well. Fortunately I had taken pictures with my phone of the puzzles I had done and they were date stamped. So I was able to put together a reasonable timeline.,1,0,1444480285,1444727632
cvu3hh8,1,t3_3nbaq7,ChrisDeg87-2,"I keep a spreadsheet with the following columns:
Puzzle Name, Brand, Notes, Pieces, Start Date, Finish Date

That is followed by the following calculated columns:
Total Pieces, Days (this puzzle), Total Days, Pcs/Day, tot Pcs/Day, Estimated Pieces/Year

cvu3d01,1,t3_3noo9l,ChrisDeg87-2,OOOH I got the exact same Birth of Venus puzzle for my birthday.  It makes me want to finish my 5000 piece even quicker (about 1900 pieces to go),1,0,1444421842,1444727632
cvnxios,0,t1_cvnxcxe,ChrisDeg87-2,Fair enough.  I dont focus on y'all team so all I have heard was for the calling for the coach's head but then I see this game and thought Tannehill's game play was worse than the actual play calling so I just wanted to hear the opinion of someone who watched all four games.,1,0,1443978600,1444727632
cvnxahv,1,t3_3ngbnm,ChrisDeg87-2,"So Dolphins fans, do you consider this loss the coach or teh QB fault or both?",5,0,1443978242,1444727632
cvnfpy9,1,t3_3ne8ae,ChrisDeg87-2,send lots of screen shots!  Cant wait to see your progress.,2,0,1443929156,1444727632
cvduahk,1,t3_3mcf93,ChrisDeg87-2,"Try to slow down.  I struggled at that point of the program as well.  I remember being so close to the end and wanting to see more distance progress and was just pushing the pace too fast in the beginning of the run.  Once I mentally said I am going to run slow just to make sure I can get through the day and check it off the list, I was able to get through.  Good luck and keep at it.  ",1,0,1443195924,1444727632
cvdo1vy,1,t3_3m9gpv,ChrisDeg87-2,"I know the feeling!  I have been doing a 5000 piece since Father's day.  

My only advice when it seems overwhelming is that every single piece that you fit together makes you not only one step closer to finishing but also one less piece that you have to go through to fit the next piece.  
Great job on sorting it seems like you have a plan in place and just have to execute it.  Good luck. ",2,0,1443184609,1444727632
cvbvrnr,0,t1_cvbsso0,ChrisDeg87-2,Yep I Agree I always keep a list of my goals for the day on a sheet next to me and add these small tasks to it as they come up. Then when I finish my current task I review the list and knock out all these quick hits.,3,0,1443045805,1444727632
cvbfss8,1,t3_3m19ge,ChrisDeg87-2,"I agree with your tip but I will add that this only applies when you are reviewing what needs to be done.  If you are already working on something and someone needs you to do something that will only take 2 minutes, more time is lost breaking away from your current task, doing this task and then having to get back to the point you were in your original task.
