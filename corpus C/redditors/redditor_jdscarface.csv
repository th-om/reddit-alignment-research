cvxf2eo,0,t1_cvxcli2,jdscarface,"I don't believe in God, but for a compromise let's try something. Doesn't God work through nature? Like the creation of man- creationism used to be the norm until we realized people evolved over time. But why should we have needed to evolve? Why not creationism? Well, some say He works through nature. This is consistent with science because so far every question we've answered has indeed had a natural explanation. 

So doesn't it make sense that if He's 'working on everyone' He'd be doing it through a natural process? Morality can be explained using evolution just as all of our behavior can, that's the groundwork for our obligation. You think God is behind all of it, but I still have a natural explanation. 

And just because it's really bugging me, you can just use 'regardless!' ",13,0,1444686807,1444731296

cvxcg6u,0,t1_cvxc1du,jdscarface,"..From the link you provided, one inch above what you copied and pasted:

>Possibly the earliest affirmation of reciprocity reflecting the Ancient Egyptian concept of Maat appears in the story of The Eloquent Peasant, which dates to the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040 – c. 1650 BC): ""Now this is the command: Do to the doer to make him do."" This proverb embodies the du ut des principle. A Late Period (c. 664 BC – 323 BC) papyrus contains an early negative affirmation of the Golden Rule: ""That which you hate to be done to you, do not do to another.""

Also I make a point of not trusting anyone who uses terms like ""absolute truth."" That line of thinking can be dangerous. ",1,0,1444682929,1444731296
cvxc6lb,0,t1_cvxbw3d,jdscarface,"You know considering how much religion depends on interpretation, which is evident by how many denominations of every religion there is, you're really stretching how 'objective' morality is even as a believer. ",4,0,1444682549,1444731296
