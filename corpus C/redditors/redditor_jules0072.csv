My baby daddy told me constantly I was making our baby stupid. I really wanted to get into Botched but couldn't take the commentary from him. ",1,1,1444715151,1444719114

cvoswh2,0,t1_cvnrqgx,jules0072,"The Reddit Sanders cult is almost as bad as Bitcoin. No room for legitimate questions, they are ignored or downvoted or given the same response (something usually having to do with Sanders supposedly still being a mystery to various groups of votes, or the mainstream media never covers Bernie).

cvehdai,0,t1_cveb9le,jules0072,"Sooo I noticed you mentioned you can't stand the area. Is the rent obstacles a sign? When I got preg we were arguing about where to live, he just took a job in an area of the state that is nothing short of devastatingly miserable, I fucking hate it there. So I moved 3 hours away, he is home on the weekends. He took the transfer against my wishes, rents were prohibitively expensive, and the area sucks the big one. I told him he doesn't want a pregnant lady/new mom who is mired in depression and anger. It sucks the way things are now, but my health and happiness are required for me to be baby's incubator and primary caretaker. Yours is too. ",2,0,1443237195,1444719114
