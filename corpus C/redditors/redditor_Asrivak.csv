cvx10wg,1,t3_3o0vre,Asrivak,"Perhaps there isn't a trade off. Perhaps as the elephants lineage increased in mass, the increase in the rate of cancer was its own selective pressure. And that large elephants wouldn't exist today unless they adapted a method to suppress tumors, like whales. Maybe the incidence of cancer that we see in elephants today, which is comparable to the overall incidence of cancer in humans, is just a point of equilibrium where the incidence of cancer no longer produces the pressures that favor organisms with superior methods of managing cancer. 

Also, the naked mole-rat is notable in its cancer suppressing abilities, but not comparable. Hasn't the lower incidence of cancer and increased longevity in mole-rats been linked to the way their tissue manages lactic acid due to living underground in oxygen deprived environments?

cvu955s,1,t3_3o46as,Asrivak,"Wait, cynobacteria aren't algae. Although they're sometimes called blue-green algae, that's a misnomer. Chloroplasts may have evolved from cynobacteria, but algae are eukaryotes. They, and all plants descended from them, acquired chloroplasts by domesticating cynobacteria, kind of like their earlier ancestors, our common ancestors, did with mitochondria.

Besides, the Prime Minister is a figurehead. He has a whole staff supporting him, but the issues he stands for need attention. Climate change, regulating substances, addressing economic disparity. We're not going to get the necessary reforms to intellectual property right protections with Harper, who is only looking out for the interests of the wealthy, and we just took a massive step backwards with the TPP. Life plus 70 years? Ridiculous. Every idea will be owned by someone. And now we're subject to the whims and absurdities of the US judicial system. 

And sure Putin has done some shit. He made billions on taxpayer's money, lead a corrupt government and isolated an entire nation of people in the interest of his egocentric and self serving goals. Putin's all talk. He does shit to say he's done shit, because he's image obsessed but those pictures only expose him as the deeply insecure shell of a man he is. As least Trudeau seems human in those pics. 

Putin is already being eaten alive by his own actions. He doesn't inspire support from his neighbors. And he'd never have the upper hand against Trudeau, or even Harper. He's like Kim Jung Un, a tyrant we're forced to accept because nobody wants to go to war. ",1,0,1444230702,1444724966
cvr0mgt,0,t1_cvqctbs,Asrivak,"Marijuana is a huge issue. Legal markets mean no longer funding black markets, or organized crime in or outside of Canada. It means no longer victimizing innocent Canadians for victimless crimes, and is the right step toward treating substances abuse as a mental health issue and not as a crime. 

Besides, comparing Trudeau to Putin is a joke. Putin is disgusting. He looks like a pedophile, and even when he's not saying anything it seems like he's lying about something. Although naive, if confronted by Putin, I expect Trudeau might bring something refreshingly blunt to the table. And he seems to uphold the values of the younger generation regarding climate change, which we need to urgently address. 

Oh, and don't hate the hair cuz you ain't got hair. Maybe it just grows that way. Besides, those pictures span like 15 years, of course he looks like a kid in the pics from when he's a kid, lol",1,0,1444197549,1444724966
