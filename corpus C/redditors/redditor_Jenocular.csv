cvrp5j2,1,t3_3nvtcg,Jenocular,I always kept a percent of the value of my home liquid in case of repairs.  A grand seems almost absurd considering what just about any emergency costs.  If they don't have it in savings are the liquidating assets when they have a medical bill or home repair?,23,0,1444250027,1444719785
cvrmufj,0,t1_cvrmkf5,Jenocular,"And the lawsuits would be never ending.  Fat people would she because they don't fit, the handicapped would sue since it doesn't have wheelchair access, and evangelicals would protest since the slide promoted abortion.",350,0,1444246733,1444719785

cvrlotc,0,t1_cvrkyiq,Jenocular,Actually let me take a step back.  If I remember correctly the problem with Safeway was that they wouldn't promote from outside the company.  I'm almost positive I went there while waiting to get into grad school to get a management position and they wouldn't take my application because I hadn't worked my way you from bagboy.  So it's entirely possible that I had no chance to get a checker job there in highschool since I had a nice checked job and wouldn't have dropped down to bagger.  It's a long time ago so I just don't remember.  What I do remember though is partying with the safeway girls and they all made $12 at the register.  ,-4,0,1444245053,1444719785
cvrka8v,0,t1_cvrj54m,Jenocular,What you did was stupid though.  When I was in highschool I worked at a drugstore next to a Safeway and we all desperately wanted to work there.   I made a bit over minimum wage while they made $12 an hour.  You shouldn't have taken a minimum wage union job.  That makes no sense.,-4,0,1444243012,1444719785
cvrf79x,0,t1_cvret57,Jenocular,"So we should get rid of all benefits so that the rich are happy?

Other countries simply balance work-life and don't need to make billions of dollars while providing no benefits.  One day we'll figure that out.",8,0,1444235668,1444719785
cvr5rd1,1,t3_3nsgw4,Jenocular,"From Stockholm fly with Norwegian or take the train to Abisko.  Do not miss this!  Go up for at least 4 nights but try to do it around a new moon if you can.  Go dogsledding and cross country skiing if you want, see the ice hotel in the area, but mostly go see the northern lights.  Download an app to see stellar activity and check out the online camera to see how things look outside as soon as it gets dark.",2,0,1444218130,1444719785
cvr5nxp,0,t1_cvr5ife,Jenocular,That's incredibly sexist and ignorant.  Especially considering men get paternity leave.  Months off for men too.,11,0,1444217816,1444719785
cvr5ku6,0,t1_cvqqgp9,Jenocular,It's cheaper to do it in Europe with the rail passes if you're interested.  It's an especially good deal there since you can bring two kids up to age 11 for free.  ,1,0,1444217529,1444719785
