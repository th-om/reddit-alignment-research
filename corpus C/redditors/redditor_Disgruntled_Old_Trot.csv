cv5cnp7,1,t3_3lajqq,Disgruntled_Old_Trot,I'm at Antietam for a few days. Today being the anniversary of the battle the morning began at 7 with the Dawn in the Cornfield event. Just enough fog to add atmosphere without making the drive to the battlefield over narrow roads scary. A little bit later came the all day hike of the battlefield. A bit warmer in the afternoon than I would have liked but I survived.,3,0,1442537819,1444725369

As luck would have it, we got there just as they were firing up the engines on the B-17 so we got to watch that and see it take off. There was also a wonderfully shiny P-51 and a very nice B-25. Also an SNJ which also took off while we were there. Finally the B-17 landed and we went home.",2,0,1441637286,1444725369
