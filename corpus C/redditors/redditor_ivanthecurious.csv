We can do better than the people who came before us. 

EDIT: Guys, it's a fact that Washington owned slaves. The point is that the fact that Washington did something, like celebrate Columbus Day, doesn't make it right. ",-28,0,1444684830,1444717340

There's no publicly available evidence that the ""new securities"" as you call them have done anything to prevent new acts of terrorism, as opposed to good old fashioned investigative law enforcement.
