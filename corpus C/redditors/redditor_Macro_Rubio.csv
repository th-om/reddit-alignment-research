cv0byx2,1,t3_3kth25,Macro_Rubio,"We refer to the balls as ""testicles"" when they only make up part of the sac.  

Is it weird we say ""mouth"" to reference the lips and gums, not just the space?  Should we say ""open your lips"" when we instead say ""open your mouth""?

Is there a word to use in place other than the gender neutral ""genitalia""?

cv0bmrz,0,t1_cv0bese,Macro_Rubio,"Even then, the GOP debates are usually pretty weak tea.  I thought the most intensive policy debates of recent time was the democratic debates between Clinton, Obama and Edwards. Or the Bush v Gore debates if you ignore the Bush parts. 

It will be much more interesting when the candidates begin to debate each other, not just an effigy of Clinton.",1,0,1442172825,1444729809

cuyi7t6,1,t3_3kln1r,Macro_Rubio,"From TSA webpage:

Frozen liquid items are allowed through the checkpoint as long as they are frozen solid when presented for screening. If frozen liquid items are partially melted, slushy, or have any liquid at the bottom of the container, they must meet 3-1-1 liquids requirements.
If the frozen item is packed with ice or ice packs in a cooler or other container, the ice or ice packs must be completely frozen when brought through screening. If the ice or ice packs are partially melted and have any liquid at the bottom of the container, they will not be permitted.

Medically necessary liquids may be accompanied by ice packs, but we ask that you declare these items to a security officer for inspection. 

You can pack frozen perishables in your carry-on or checked baggage in dry ice. The FAA limits you to five pounds of dry ice that is properly packaged (the package is vented).

The 3-1-1 rule for liquids, aerosols and gels in carry-ons is as follows: containers must be 3.4 ounces or less; stored in a 1 quart/liter zip-top bag; 1 zip-top bag per person. Larger amounts of non-medicinal liquids, gels, and aerosols must be placed in checked baggage.

If the liquid is considered a hazardous material that is permitted onboard an aircraft, it is still subject to the 3-1-1 limitations. Many questions arise on whether an item is hazardous material and what requirements must be met to take it on an aircraft. The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) at 1-800-467-4922 or the aircraft operator on which you are flying can assist you with your questions concerning hazardous material.

The fact is, after The first round of states, SC,FL, IO, NH, and a couple others, we will see the pack significantly tighten to tow or three. ",1,0,1442015575,1444729809
