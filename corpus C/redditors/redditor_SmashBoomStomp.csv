csss3ye,0,t1_csslrrv,SmashBoomStomp,"As an open minded progressive Texan that is reading hateful text that my home state is ""dead weight"" despite the fact that we are home to NASA and many growing energy departments, you have my thanks for sticking up for us. I can't believe the amount of hate and division I'm seeing in this thread and it's incredibly disheartening. Anyways, I digress. Thank you for being apart of the difference friend!",1,0,1436100685,1444725900
crwnsua,0,t1_crwn9ds,SmashBoomStomp,"""While the first U.S. solar plant, built in 1982, generated 1 megawatt of electricity, Desert Sunlight generates 550 megawatts. Topaz produces the same amount. Together their impact on carbon emissions is equivalent to taking 130,000 cars off the road while providing 340,000 homes with clean energy."" Quote from Josh Sanburn of TIME magazine. Hope this helps!",11,0,1433525761,1444725900
crt0rbl,0,t1_crsr3xf,SmashBoomStomp,"Very fair question! Haha. IMO I just love the vast history of Texas, our awesome cuisine (amazing bbq, even better tex-mex) the amazing theatrical center in Houston, the fact that we have NASA(many of my friends growing up had parents that worked for NASA), the museum of fine arts Houston which is second really only to NYC, and the awesome Hispanic culture which blends well/beautifully with the rest of American culture. We also have a beautiful nature scene which I'm saddened to see being ruined by corporate greed/corrupt politicians. If given the chance absolutely visit Austin!! North East is also incredibly awesome though, hope I didn't come off as narcissistic! Have an awesome day",1,0,1433257067,1444725900

crsiv1g,1,t3_384hpx,SmashBoomStomp,"This is great! I'd love to see more states keep up this positive momentum. I'm sad that my home state of Texas which is such a great state in so many ways actually led the drive for banning ""bans on fracking"" Hopefully voters will be motivated sometime soon to repeal it.",0,0,1433209253,1444725900
crjq67d,0,t1_crjom4i,SmashBoomStomp,"We are on the subject of government, not ""thugs"" and at this point in the discussion you are metaphorically putting words in my mouth. Feel free to down vote my comment, but I'm on this subreddit to learn from others and to discuss with them. ",1,0,1432507842,1444725900
crjlkeg,0,t1_crjjhiy,SmashBoomStomp,"Is that how you would hold a waitress accountable if you had a mess up on your order? If you want to see change you have to be civil, practical and patient. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. Also I don't know what you hope to solve by storming into congress with an AK-47. I'm not trying to be rude and I hope it doesn't come off that way, all I'm trying to say is that we can hold our representatives accountable through our democracy and civic duty with today's diplomacy. We have seen this with a handful of politician's being a great example of holding others accountable in the senate.",1,0,1432498171,1444725900
crjip4u,0,t1_crji1lw,SmashBoomStomp,"Perhaps, but only if you don't hold them accountable. It's exactly your kind of apathy that halts progress in public policy. Be apart of the difference, friend.",10,0,1432492092,1444725900
crgzwte,1,t3_36os1q,SmashBoomStomp,"Firstly, congrats on the MAJOR weight loss man! That is incredible and simply awesome. It seems like you have a cluttered mind right now, (of course correct me if i'm wrong.) so perhaps trying to get a job that doesn't require a college degree is your best bet until you find your calling. 

My father used to tell me that the biggest motivator for college is to spend a year doing blue collar work, and this may actually work for you as well! If you are looking to provide a physical stimulation for your body try blue collar work. This way, you can combine working out with a job. 

Maybe this will be the motivation you need to find what YOU want to do with life. I have complete faith in you brother! PS- Try not to worry about gaining all the weight back, i'm sure you won't. Maybe its time to scale back on the exercise (still continue of course, but not so excessively)
