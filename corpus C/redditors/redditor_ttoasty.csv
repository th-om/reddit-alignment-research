You're right about Fast & Furious, although it's a bit overblown, too. The media coverage it did get treated it like a new Iran-Contra. ",2,0,1444349712,1444722535

cvsa0ee,1,t3_3nxqtm,ttoasty,"The left definitely had it's far share of crazies back then.  As a teenager, I bought into a lot of it.  Stuff like calls to impeach Bush, the belief that the Iraq War was started in part because of religious reasons, the fear that Bush would implement martial law and stay in power (sound familiar?).

However, I think there are some differences between then and now.  Particularly, in accountability of our current administration, both in the media and by the opposition party, that weren't really present during Bush's administration.  Look at how many investigations there's been into Benghazi, for example, compared to the Plame Affair.  In my opinion, during Obama's administration we've seen mountains made out of molehills, when during Bush's administration we could barely get anyone to make mountains out of mountains.

That's not to say that accountability has been all that great during Obama's administration.  I think many big issues have been ignored, and conservative media and politicians have largely focused on non-issues that make for a good political narrative.  Like Benghazi or the IRS ""scandal"" over things like drone strikes or domestic surveillance.  The VA is perhaps the biggest actual scandal that I've seen Obama be held accountable for, and it pales in comparison to some of the things we let Bush get away with.  I'm curious to see if anyone keeps pushing the Doctors Without Borders controversy going on right now, or if it will just fade away with the news cycle.

**TL;DR:** I'm bias, but I don't think Obama has really had controversies on the same scale as Bush.  And I mean real controversies, not just political differences or fabricated scandals.  I also think that Obama has faced a level of accountability from the media and the opposition party much greater than that Bush faced, although it's still pretty lacking in terms of actual substance.  But there's still definitely a narrative that will always hold an opposing President to be much worse than he actually is.  And there were definitely some crazies on the left that were on par with something like the Conservative Tribune today.",31,0,1444291373,1444722535

cvk3nft,0,t1_cvjiw2d,ttoasty,">The social justice fight Pope Francis is taking on is very commendable.

I think, from the way Pope Francis frames things, this is part of his social justice fight.  On his flight back, he was quoted saying(not directly in reference to Kim Davis), “conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right.”  And for someone, especially a pope, coming from Argentina, I imagine he takes the concept/right of conscientious objection very seriously.

I don't really agree with considering Kim Davis a conscientious objector for multiple reasons, but for someone who sees her as such, and for someone that takes conscientious objection seriously, I think the Pope's support of Kim Davis is very much in line with his social justice positions.",8,0,1443667900,1444722535

cvj0cub,0,t1_cvi2lfm,ttoasty,"John Oliver just called them out for using a 5 year old video to stir up fear around the refuge crisis in Europe.

I watch Fox News nearly every day, and I'm fairly far left.  I watch MSNBC occasionally, as well.  You take the most outrageous person on MSNBC, Chris Matthews, and he doesn't come close to the most outrageous person on Fox News, Sean Hannity.  Or Bill O'Reilly.  That's mostly related to bias, but Fox News producers are much more willing to mislead or even approach lying than their MSNBC counterparts.

The actual news coverage from Fox tends to be much less bias than their opinion shows, and roughly on par with the bias in MSNBC's news programs.  Neither of them have news coverage past like, 4 or 5 o'clock, though.  It's just opinion for the rest of the night.

Edit: Also, this is a bit of a tangent, but Fox News has like an 8th grade comprehension level, if that.  I've never heard an actual, deep, thoughtful discussion on any of their opinion shows (other than maybe some interviews).  Chris Hayes and Lawrence O'Donnell both regularly have real conversations, even with people they disagree with.",1,0,1443591397,1444722535
cvizwnp,0,t1_cvi309w,ttoasty,"> However, seeking out abuse is not even a thought.

Neither side is particularly interested in this, though.  Democrats refute or downplay the idea of welfare abuse (which is grossly overstated in political rhetoric and public perception), but Republicans rarely attempt to implement changes that would actually try to address abuse and only abuse.

Republicans would rather have the welfare queen stereotype to throw around and vilify impoverished Americans.  It's why you see them use the stereotype while calling for cuts in welfare services, not when trying to implement systems to catch fraud and abuse.

Democrats, meanwhile, look like they're defending these abusers more than they actually intend to, because they're defending welfare programs from being gutted.   

Edit: Not to say that this is what's happening every single time, but it's a pretty common story.  I see it, in a way, like the gun rights advocates' responses to school shootings and such, but in reverse.  The left uses these as reasons why we need stricter gun control, conservatives reject the policy proposals outright, and it comes off as though conservatives are apathetic towards mass shootings.",1,0,1443590210,1444722535
