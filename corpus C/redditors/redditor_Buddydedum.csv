I feel that popular lack of support is probably going to be the more serious issue in the immediate future, but post-election a more active military is very possible.

And that's exactly it.  Turkey, despite concerns of Islamism and related challenges to democracy, has made a phenomenal amount of progress undermining the traditional elite under the AKP, whether or not you have (very legitimate) concerns about some of their policies.  Paternalism remains an issue, of course, but it's a different kind.",2,0,1444195686,1444720969
cvqzzeu,0,t1_cvqttht,Buddydedum,"Well, in my view the PKK doesn't have a very good chance - though again, predictions are miserably unreliable.  

The PKK *could* be successful in creating an autonomous region in a peace process, depending on the level of chaos the current situation creates.  That'll depend on how much more mainstream Kurds support the movement and how difficult the military campaign becomes.  Even if it's very successful, there's still a fairly good chance of increased autonomy.  However, a state is a whole different matter because it'll almost certainly require patronage, and the PKK isn't in a great position for that.

The problem with the PKK is that it has a very long way to go in rehabilitating itself in the view of Western governments, and the current conflict won't make that easier.  It's still considered a terrorist organization by NATO, which limits its potential patronage pool.  If this Kurdish State had very strong American support, I'm certain it would be able to exist, but would that be worth it to the United States, and how sustainable would it be?  

Developing US ties with Kurdish groups in Iraq and Syria is certainly a reality, and its a very important aspect of the Turkish-American split, though remember that those relationships are not with the PKK.  But ultimately, the real question is whether the US be willing to drop a Turkish ally for a Kurdish one, because that's what creating a Kurdish state would do.  Given the enormous initial investment in military and developmental aid that it would take to make Kurdistan sustainable, and the relative military and diplomatic strengths of Turkey and a hypothetical Kurdistan, I'm doubtful.  Turkey's strategic value seems like a lot more of a net benefit to the United States as an ally than Kurdistan, which is compounded by the fact it would also make Turkey a geopolitical rival and force it to seriously reconsider its alignments, almost certainly to the detriment of American regional strategy.

But complicating that is the geopolitics of a Kurdish state.  We're talking about a landlocked nation surrounded on all sides by nations that almost certainly wouldn't recognize its existence (barring some very weird post-civil war politics in Syria).  It would be almost entirely reliant on oil export for its sustainability, but that would need to go through one of those geopolitical rivals, placing the country at the mercy of relations with one of those actors.  That would almost certainly mean a patronage relationship that would seriously complicate US support for the country (imagine the US sponsoring a Kurdish Republic at enormous expense only to see it become a dependent of Turkey, or (in a nightmare case) Iran).  

So a Kurdish state could be possible, but I can't see the US being the primary sponsor.  In an interesting twist, I *could* imagine a Kurdistan with a Turkish sponsor, but not in the near future, and it would mean dependency for the state and a renunciation of claims on Turkish Kurdistan.  Barzani has hinted at relations with Turkey being key to his strategy, though that certainly doesn't mean patronage is the direction he's going.  Independence in that fashion, to answer your question in a roundabout way, would ironically mean the end of the PKK, I suspect.",2,0,1444195682,1444720969
cvqs55f,1,t3_3nrkpg,Buddydedum,"Well, first off, ""the worst geopolitical crisis the country has faced since the establishment of the modern republic"" is pretty hyperbolic.  It's a massive challenge, no doubt, but Turkey's gone through a lot worse.  WWII is a much, much better contender for the ""worst"" crisis, and the 70s crash or the economic and Kurdish problems of the 90s are at least close to the level of the current crisis, so let's not get carried away with the ""Turkey is collapsing"" sign-waving (not saying that's necessarily what you're doing).  It's weathered it's (quite substantial) share of crises before, so it's not unpracticed.

But I think the core problem here is your idea that there's been a serious reversal, assuming you mean in the sense that Turkey had a successful foreign policy in the 2001-2010 era which has become unsuccessful.  Turkey is facing a crisis, but it's not exactly a consequence of poor policy as much as it is a changing (for the worse) strategic environment, in my opinion, at least.

But what is the nature of the crisis right now?  I think that we can divy them up into sections:

**Domestic Crisis**

I'd argue that the core geopolitical problem that Turkey faces is in part the Syrian conflict, but more importantly is the new face of the Kurdish question - that is, what makes this different from the 1980s-90s.  The fighting certainly isn't the scale it was then yet, but what makes this different is the rise in strength of Kurdish identity in those Kurds that historically supported the government as you might see in the Summer 2015 election successes of the HDP.  Without that Kurdish support, military operations in the southeast are probably going to be exponentially more difficult than they were in the 1990s.  This is only compounded by domestic polarization at home as a consequence of AKP policies.

With the renewal of fighting with the PKK, Turkey is in a better military position than it was in the 1990s in terms of capabilities, but that question of domestic support is going to be a serious challenge.

But the most important question here is the Military (TSK).  Historically, whenever the Republic became too stagnated by politicization or threatened to turn away from its Kemalist routes, the TSK would stage a coup.  However, we'd be being analytically lazy if we thought that the current situation is the same.  The military has been gradually withdrawn from domestic politics since Ã–zal, and especially under the AKP (largely as a consequence of EU accession efforts) its role has diminished substantially.  So of the periods for Turkey to undergo a domestic crisis, this is arguably one of the best, at least in terms of coup threat.

The Kurdish conflict and the military are the most closely related to poor Turkish policy, but they've been enabled by a variety of geopolitical factors, and (at least in the case of the military) mitigated by fairly good policy.

**Strategic Depth and Regional Instability**

Now, as you note, Strategic Depth (as originally conceptualized), was a resounding failure by (at the very latest) early 2013.  Zero problems with neighbours only works as long as you actually have zero problems with your neighbours, and as Turkey became increasingly engaged in the Middle East, there was no way that it could have maintained its touted ""equidistance"".  But was that the degree of failure that its continually touted as?  I'm not so sure, the geopolitical pressures against the policy were enormous, but that doesn't mean the policy is dead.

Strategic Depth has changed.  With the rapidly shifting Balance of Power following the 2011 Spring, frankly, Turkey couldn't geopolitically afford to remain unengaged.  The current policy of the government (if it survives November) is (and needs) to be engaged.  

Syria, now that Turkey has made its ouster a primary objective, would make a return to classical Strategic Depth impossible, which means that it has to engage.  But that's not an existential threat to the Turkish government.  It's a challenge, and increased Russian and Iranian influence in the country will likely act as a muffler on Turkey's regional power, but that's not the core of Turkey's challenge.

The instability in Iraq and Syria is a threat to Turkey due to questions of Kurdish autonomy.  That's the only major geopolitical challenge that seriously threatens the regime, particularly given the domestic challenges I outlined above.  A Kurdish state (or substantively powerful autonomous region(s)) would be twice the muffler Russian and Iranian influence would be, and would potentially spur domestic Kurdish support for the PKK.

Most of this was simply out of Turkey's hands.  Now, acknowledging that Turkey's defence/foreign policy (gov't) communities are notoriously opaque, I'd argue that Strategic Depth is changing to suit new realities, rather than experiencing an outright policy failure.

**Western Relationships**

Accession to the EU wasn't really encouraged by ""Western leaders,"" as you suggest.  It was encouraged by the United States, and begrudgingly considered by EU leaders who were frustrated by the Turkish position on Cyprus and concerns about what Turkish accession would mean for (particularly) transfer payments, as well as other economic challenges and questions of democratic challenges.  

In that context, it makes a whole lot of sense that the AKP engaged in its Middle East pivot. Moving west was extremely difficult, so an eastern pivot was an excellent decision, and that's where you get Strategic Depth doctrine put into place.

Then there's the relationship with NATO and the United States.  Arguably, the relationship with the United States has been Turkey's most important and most contentious since the post-war era when Turkey had to threaten to draw closer to the Soviets to cinch NATO accession.  US-Turkish interests were largely on the same side from that point on until the Soviet collapse saw their interests begin to dovetail.  Today, they're aligned on a tactical level in Syria and Iraq, but at a strategic level they both want to see a very different post-war environment.  

But again, this isn't really poor policy.  In fact, Turkey's position on Cyprus is unequivocally a good policy for the government in charge.  While it alienates the West, I can't see a successful government in the near future that ceases support for Cypriot Turks.  It's not so great from a military perspective, but it's important for Turkish prestige.  And the declining relationship with the US is not a serious failure in policy either.  It'll take a lot of work to make sure that dyad stays taut, but the current slack is a natural consequence of losing the Soviet focal point.

**The Future**

This is actually what you're asking about, and I'm going to spend an appallingly small amount of time with it, so I apologize.  But as we all know, prediction are very, very rarely accurate, so here's my speculation.

Domestically, I have no idea what's going to happen.  I expect that the November elections will have largely the same results as the last ones, which will mean continued domestic instability and create a serious challenge to whatever political mess forms the government.  Assuming the AKP stays on top (I'd say its relatively (?) likely), no problems will go away, and I honestly don't see the CHP doing a better job, though it has a better shot at forming an alright coalition.  In either case, I suspect the Kurdish question, especially among domestic, formerly pro-government Kurds will be the key challenge of any government.  I can't imagine a coup in the near future, but really, if one was in the works, would I?

Turkey (any government) will need to remain engaged in the Middle East.  Syria will act as an insulator to Turkish influence and Assad's removal will remain a priority, though almost certainly below the campaign against the PKK.  It will attempt to retain relations with Iran and Russia, and probably leverage that into a political compromise, but it's wouldn't be quiet about its opposition if they continue to increase their involvement.

I suspect relations with the US will continue to decline, just because of the energy involved in keeping them on track.  But that's really going far out with the speculation, and I wouldn't take my word for it.

In sum, I don't think we're seeing a total collapse of Turkish power, just a very, very serious and enormously destabilizing ""roadbump"" (understatement for rhetorical effect).  Turkey's economy may be faltering, but that's happened before and its gotten back on growing, so I suspect that the rise of Turkey isn't quite done yet.",26,0,1444180004,1444720969

>Policy is 100% subjective. It's a dream.

Then why does the site you held up as an exemplar of your methodology analyze it?

>Taxes and economic freedom is tangible.

You're getting a bit out there.  Do you just have no education in the social sciences?  Because analysis is covered pretty early.

>ROTFLMAO! Yeah, dont go validating my arguments of state power based on ideology!

>""Nuance"", more Voodoo, eh!

If your model can't deal with a type of variable, there's a problem with the model, not reality.  That's nuance.  Acknowledging there more to reality than what a single model measures.  I'm not sure why you're having trouble here.

Nuance is voodoo?  What are you on about?  This is basically saying, ""If something isn't black and white, simple and easy to understand, it must be magic!""

Also, what is this ideology I have that you are so certain I possess?  It's weird that you can recognize that I'm biased and have subjectivity, but by some miracle, you have escaped such petty human concerns.

>False. Since I objectively put a value on life and freedom, 

No, you subjectively put a value on particular lives and particular freedoms.  Seriously, look at a dictionary.  If you are valuing something above another (like ""freedom"" over ""tyranny""), that is literally the definition of subjectivity. (Objectively the definition, of subjectivity, if you will).  I don't know why this is so hard.

cuz7w98,0,t1_cuz5fqo,Buddydedum,">Here is one method... http://www.heritage.org/index/about

This is not a tyranny scale.  It's measuring economic freedom - that is, how free people are (just economically) in each of its ten categories.  This is possible to do because you're limiting the variables and (this is key) *combining qualitative and quantitative analysis*.  That's policy analysis, and methods you dismiss as subjective.  So how can you do that, and then also claim that this is an entirely objective measure?

By limiting variables to certain things, you are subjectively selecting those things that you decide are most important to the question at hand, leaving out others because you are providing an abstraction of reality.  This leaves you open to criticism, and as I'm sure you're aware, there's plenty of academic criticism for the variables selected by Heritage.  This is a good thing, and most certainly doesn't mean that IEF isn't a valuable tool (it is), but this is social science we're talking about.  It's not a perfect science.

In any case, you still don't have any sort of oppression scale, because the political reaches far more than just the realm of economics.

>Well, you were inferring that when you were trying to dismiss this...
I'm quite sure the people in front of the govt firing squad would disagree with you.

No, I was implying that when you dismiss the analysis of how we're defining oppression as something someone who was about to be executed would not be critiquing, you're appealing to emotion and not dealing with the actual question (which is important, in building a study).

>That's fine. I wont argue that you can exclude criminal executions and accidents.

>Although liberals would probably argue execution for crimes is cruel and unusual.

>Fine. We can account for that.

Okay, so if you accept these parts, you're acknowledging that along with a quantitative method, you need some sort of qualitative historical analysis to discern which statistics should be used, and that's before we get to the complications that arise from imperfect information (as clearly, totalitarian government records are frequently spotty, and records close to the liberty end of your spectrum might not even exist).

>If you think that, change your entire rebuttal to ""adding up govt oppression on individuals is an appeal to emotion and is nonsense'. Does that sound about right to you?

I'm confused, did you accidentally copy-paste one of your previous responses?  If not, I addressed this above.

>So you are against individual freedom?

>Also, compared to what, the biased scale of what ideology you think is best?

I'm not, but I'm well-enough aware of my place in history to know that my (subjective) value of individualism and freedom is the consequence of my existence in a country that derived its legal and educational traditions from the enlightenment, and that these values (as we understand them) are fairly new in the historical view.

As such, I'm also aware that an attempt to be able to measure any political tradition anywhere (objectively) needs to avoid the presentism trap.

So we measure things not against particularly ideologies, but against theoretical and practical trends that can be applied to as many ideologies as possible.

>How do you measure ideological good?

You don't.  You measure what people think as close to their own terms as possible.  So if my political vision held that ""we need to create a party that establishes total control so industrialize our country"" I'd fit on your scale in some ways. But if I thought ""We need to restore the monarchy,"" I wouldn't fit in neatly anywhere on your scale, because your scale isn't addressing the ideology on its own terms.

>Well, isn't total state power fascist and totalitarian?

It is totalitarian, but it isn't necessarily fascist.  Fascism is an extremely complicated set of different theoretical traditions.  I mean, should we include Nazism under the label of fascism? That's a serious academic debate.  What about Kemalists? Etc.

Fascist Spain and Fascist Italy had very different levels of power they were able to exert on their populations, for both practical and legal reasons.  It's entirely possible to be more totalitarian than a fascist.

>All you are saying is you want to measure ideological dreams of an outcome. Science cannot measure a dream or vision.

No, I'm not saying that at all.  But social science can analyze the traditions and trends in a political ideology.  It's pretty much the point of political theory as an academic discipline.

>What about state sanctioned murder based on race, religion, or ideology? How come you never use that as an example?

Because those would fit neatly into your measure of state killing indicative of an oppressive state.  My point is that your position deals very poorly with nuance and pretends to be objective by avoiding looking at the grey areas that require subjectivity to analyze.

>This..

>* (of a person or their judgment) not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts: Contrasted with subjective.

Yes, that's the adjective.  Measuring threats to your life can be done objectively, but it is not an objective goal because it implies that there isn't inherent in that a subjective valuation of your life.

It also cannot be used as a noun as you did when you said: ""Self interest is an objective.""  That's a different word.

>I dont place much weight in the opinions of those that want to die or willingly walk in front of a firing squad.

>I have an objectively high standards.

You're not really addressing the point.  The idea that you can dismiss someone else's feelings because they don't conform to your own is pretty much the definition of subjectivity.

Okay, I'll bite.  Explain your method to me.  What range of values do you use for oppressiveness; what set of variables do you use do measure a nation's base ""oppression""; and how do you add ""quantity of people killed by state action"" with ""limitations on the people's ability to peacefully assemble"" on a standard scale, as a sample.

>If you think that, change your entire rebuttal to ""adding up govt oppression on individuals is an appeal to emotion and is nonsense'.
Does that sound about right to you?

That's not what I said at all.  I'm not sure if you're deliberately misreading, but giving the benefit of the doubt:

I stated that deaths induced by state security forces was not a clear measurement of state tyranny, because: States kill people for a wide variety of reasons which makes some deaths induced not indicative of tyranny (like a criminal execution or an accidental (or not state-ordered) death or abuse of power by a security official), as an example; States frequently don't have complete control over their security forces, making it problematic to directly link increased deaths > increased tyranny; This would be *very* likely to give increased weight to larger countries, since having a larger population will almost certainly increase the quantity killed.

Your response was ""I'm sure someone who was going to be executed would disagree.""

That's an appeal to emotion.  I was attempting to discern how exactly you were defining and measuring tyranny, and your response avoided dissecting the question by *appealing to emotion*, to the idea that someone about to be executed would not question what is meant by ""tyranny"".  I'm not interested in that person's definition, I am interested in a definition that is measurable or analyzable, which you have not yet provided.

>Easy. By placing who does them the most further left of who does them less. Or does that sound to hard to do?

This looks to me like qualitative and relative analysis.  The way to make it quantitative and absolute is to provide the formulas that standardize your variables, and which you allude to here:

>That's what's called the scientific method.

But you seem to have missed the point of my comment here.  I know that's the scientific method, that was my point.  My point was that method *requires subjectivity* to weight extremely varied and unrelated variables onto a common scale.

>Communism or fascism. It's left and right.

That's just silly.  Just because your scale measures communism as left (and not even the penultimate form of left) and fascism as right doesn't mean it privileges them above moderate political ideologies.

>LOL. Do you want a more fascist totalitarian govt telling you how to live, yes or no?

So, based on the way you're starting to talk, I'm assuming you're losing interest in actual, serious conversation. But this has nothing to do with what I said.  

If you're academically or professionally interested in this question, you'd understand that measuring something on a ""tyranny scale"" is naturally biasing towards the ""freedom"" side of the spectrum based on the terminology used.  This ignores the values of people who this that the state has the ability to do some good.  

If, by contrast, you used a ""state power"" scale, you wouldn't being introducing loaded terms like ""tyranny"" and you'd have a much better scale.

>LOL. You are arguing you can scientifically measure subjective and farcical dreams of Utopias against each other! LOL. You are a true ideologue.

That's not what I said.  You might need to work on your reading comprehension.  I was talking about analyzing policies against other policies, in a very similar way to what you were suggesting above.  The difference is that I'm acknowledging that we need to use qualitative policy analysis.

You really like your labels, don't you?

>Are you telling us that if the govt's reason to murder you is acceptable, you will gladly walk up against the wall all by yourself?

Obviously not.  If the state has an objective reason to murder me (say, I was a captured terrorist and the country I was in had the death penalty), it's hardly unlikely I'm going to (very subjectively) want to escape, even if I could ""objectively"" acknowledge that my escape might mean that I would kill a number of innocent people.

>Measuring threats to your life is an objective goal. Objectively, you want to avoid getting murdered.

>Self interest is an objective. You need to read what you write and understand it. You are just babbling lefty talking points and are failing to think.

Okay, so I think I figured it out.  You do realize that ""Objective"", the noun, is different from ""objective"", the adjective?

I can have an objective objective, or the objective to be objective.  They're entirely different words.

Self-preservation is an objective, but it is not an objective objective.  It's not even an objective we can objectively assume everyone has, as exemplified by, say, suicide terrorists.

Self-preservation is subjective, as whether or not I want to live is extremely highly influenced by my personal opinions and feelings.  For example, if someone said to me ""I will kill this man or you, your choice,"" and I chose to live, I am *subjectively* valuing my life above the other man's.

cuym2n5,0,t1_cuxsbsm,Buddydedum,">Policy analysis is subjective. What is not subjective is the, for example, new pages of laws, rules, and regulations that are added. That can be measured. As are how many days it actually takes to pay taxes.

You can't measure that in a coherent and qualitative way.  You can measure how many different regulations, laws, etc. are introduced, but you can't actually measure that in a standardized ""oppression-o-metre.""  Different laws and policies do extremely varied things, and that requires qualitative analysis to put it into a scale as subjective as ""oppression"".

> I'm quite sure the people in front of the govt firing squad would disagree with you.

This is not an argument.  You keep doing this, throughout this entire thread.  It's weird that someone as dedicated as ""scientific objectivity as you"" keeps resorting to appeals to emotion.

If you're looking to analyze oppression in a professional or academic context, you need to be able to dissect complicated ideas like ""oppression.""

>What part about me saying you can add all of what you just defined up, get a total, and place it on my scale is it you do not understand?

You can't.  No one can, without introducing subjectivity.  How do I ""add up"" state-induced deaths, oppressive regulations (vs. non-oppressive ones, somehow without qualitative analysis), corruption, etc. all onto a single scale?

To do this, you'd need to take the values, weight them, translate them to an ""oppression value,"" and put that sum on the scale.

Guess what that would take?  Qualitative, subjective analysis.

>I know. That scale actually has a biased political agenda. It's trying to sell one ideology over another.

What ideology is it trying to sell?  There is an inherent suggestion (due to historical context) that reformist (leftist) policy is better because of a vague notion of ""progress"", but that's absolutely not a necessary interpretation.  There are many people (myself included) that feel that in many ways many traditional values and policies are extremely valuable.  That interpretation is entirely valid, and you see as many rightists interpreting the standard scale to their benefit as you see leftists interpreting it to theirs.

It's certainly not *un*biased, but are you seriously suggesting that ""left vs. right"" is somehow more biasing than such loaded terms as ""tyranny"" and ""freedom""?

>That's why your scale is flawed. It's made up of dreams that you cannot measure. My scale does actually measure something. Rules, laws, regulations, and taxes.

What is this thing you have for calling it my scale?  It's not my scale, as addressed above.  

In either case, I'm not sure you understand what ""abstraction"" means here.  An abstraction of reality is taking parts of reality, (subjectively) placing them into a particular context in order to say they are indicative of a particular thing, and then using them as tools to interpret the wider reality.  All models, including those in the natural sciences do this, including evolutionary models to gravitational models.  All models are necessarily abstractions of reality, because they can't possibly hope to measure *everything*.  Simplification is an inherent part of science.

Edit: Incidentally, since I forgot to mention, it's absolutely possible to measure non-material things like an ideological value set/platform. It's just more difficult, since you have to do so in relative rather than absolute terms, and you need to do so qualitatively rather than quantitatively and accept the limitations, just like you need to accept the limits of the quantitative method when you use it.

>I'm sure that if the govt put you in front of a firing squad you would quickly change your mind about that. You would likely have some serious OBJECTIVE epiphany. Do you think I am wrong about that?

Again, an appeal to emotion that doesn't actually respond to the question.  No, if I'm in danger, my reaction is going to be *more* subjective than if I'm not.  That's how humans are wired, because, for obvious reasons, if I'm about to be killed I would likely be more self-interested than if I was in a position of security.

If you asked an Iranian exile who had been persecuted by the IRI during his time there, it's entirely likely he might feel that his government was the worst and most oppressive in the region.  If you spoke to a Saudi exile, it's likely he might feel equally strongly about Riyadh.  

I'd hardly call either of those two hypothetical epiphanies ""objective"" because obviously, if I'm in danger, my last thought is going to be objectively ranking my situation with those of others.  I wouldn't stop while I'm being tortured by the Syrian regime and say ""Hey, well at least this torture is not quite as bad as what I might experience if I was being held by the Islamic State.""",2,0,1442023901,1444720969

It's not my scale.  I don't particularly like and political spectrums, because people tend to think that's all there is, which is a problem because it makes people compulsively categorize all political systems, and when they see two near each other on one spectrum, they say ""Aha! Both of these things are the same!"" and completely ignore the fact that a spectrum can only measure certain things to the exclusion of other (equally important) variables.

Okay, so to your first point:

>My post is responding to the OP's position that a liberty to anarchy scale is inferior to one based on the standard left right paradigm of ""My Leftist Utopian dream is better than your Rightist Utopian dream"" and the fact you cant physically measure dreams like you can individual oppression.

So let's look at this.  First off, the left/right scale is not about superior forms of government.  All it aims to do is provide a skin-deep reference method to refer to political ideas based on a trend of ""progressiveness"" or ""tradition"", since most political ideologies tend to take some position on these issues, and many that do follow (some) similar theoretical trends.

But let's look at this (by far your more interesting claim): That you believe that your ""liberty/tyranny"" scale is more ""scientific"" than the standard one, and thus should be preferred.

To this, I want to ask, what is a political scale for?  Well, clearly its some tool through which we want to be able to refer to many extremely varied ideologies on a standard level, despite (obviously) the fact that no political ideology develops itself with its place on such a scale as the key to defining itself.  It's an abstraction of reality, as all are models (in both natural and social sciences).

So what does your ""liberty/tyranny"" scale measure?  What is its abstraction.  Well, clearly, as you've laid out, it wants to measure how ""oppressed"" the individual is in a particular political system, and you claim this is measurable.  So, the first thing we need to do here is look for variables that make this viable.  You claim we are measuring how oppressed someone is.  

Well, how would we go about doing that?  We can certainly look at the clearest examples, such as legislation and policy, security practices, and how well the two match up.  But you stated that we're looking for things we can definitively measure - that's not possible in those cases.  Here, we're talking about policy analysis, a discipline that is inherently subjective (something you claim to shun).

You can't quantify oppression.  As much as you (and I!) laud the scientific method, you have to acknowledge its failings in a social setting.  When you can't isolate variables, you have to take variables in context.  Correlations here are *useless* without a sound theoretical explanation backing them up, because the (contextualized) statistics can't speak for themselves.

What that means, in sum, is if you know politics, you know that ""objective"" measurements are not a thing.  You can only get so close to a truth.

>One other point, tyranny to liberty scale clearly defines where you are likely to be murdered by the govt and where it's least likely. The flawed standard scale does not. The tyrants at both ends will likely kill you simply for opposing them on the smallest of things.

The scale you've proposed does not do this.  Unless you've figured out a way to objectively and definitively quantify oppression. (in which case, quick! Get ye to the funding boards at your nearest and best university!) the statistic you're relying is what, quantity of deaths committed by state security forces?  That's not a clear measure of tyranny.  What is tyranny anyway?  We need to define our terms.  Are we looking at state tyranny only?  What about governments that operate through corporations that limit people's freedom? What about fractious governments that aren't explicitly oppressive, but are prone to bureaucratic corruption that limits people's rights? Et cetera, et cetera.  

So as much as you criticize the ""left/right"" spectrum for not defining its terms, you really haven't either.  You've just proposed a scale that's theoretically easier to measure, and thus claim it's better even though you haven't done the legwork to define what your scale is actually doing.

The advantage of the left-right scale is that it isn't bound by quantitative analyses of (very particular) variables.  Rather, it just uses qualitative analyses of ideological trends and compares them to others to see which is more ""progressive"" or ""traditional"".  Less precise, certainly, but it gives you (some, limited) insight into the ideology's foundations.

So here:

>Already, to the uninitiated, your scale fails at telling them which end you are freer from tyranny. That's not a good scale.

You're forgetting that's not the *point* of the left/right scale.  It's like saying, ""Well your theory of general relativity tells me nothing about the development of life on earth! That's a bad theory. My theory of evolution by natural selection is far better.""  Which is just missing the point.

You're right, the right/left scale doesn't state explicitly what ideologies are more oppressive, though there are certain tendencies.  But that's not the point.  Remember it's not measuring oppression/freedom, it's measuring tradition/progressiveness.  *Very* different.

**tl;dr:** Spectrums, like all models, are abstractions of reality, measuring certain variables to the exclusion of others.  The tyranny/liberty scale, being stuck in the social realm is also subjective. However, even if you *could* qualitatively define everything, you'd still need the subjectively decide on which variable to include and exclude to decide what you're actually measuring.  This has not been done.  The left/right scale has not done this and here it is less necessary, because it focuses on qualitative analyses of ""progressive"" and ""traditional"" trends in ideologies.  

**tl;dr: tl;dr:** Your ""scientific"" scale is not as scientific as you think it is, and the left/right scale is measuring different things.

Which scale is superior is up for debate, but I'd argue that a scale that focuses on only one aspect of government (oppressiveness) is exponentially less useful than one that at least tries to broadly define the base of the *entire* form of governance.  That's assuming your goal is to define the ideology itself, and not just a tiny part of it.",1,0,1441949358,1444720969
