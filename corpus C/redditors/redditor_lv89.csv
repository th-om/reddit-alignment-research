She is acting completely unreasonably. If she can't handle arguments and heated conversations, she shouldn't state strong opinions. Also, having an anxiety disorder does not give you the right to act like a crazy person. It sounds like she has issues outside of just anxiety, it honestly sounds more like some type of personality disorder.

If her behavior is this bad with her friends, how does she act at her job? Or school (if applicable)? Society is not responsible for keeping her feelings in check, she is the only one responsible for her actions and feelings. If she reacts severely to every situation like that, I can't imagine that she functions well on a daily basis.

You told me I was only giving hypotheticals, but so are you. I'm giving you actual, tangible numbers to support my claims. Your argument is that drug dealers can't, on average, sell an ounce of weed a day, pieced out. I strongly disagree. 

>Your average drug dealer does not drive to Colorado to buy weed.  If you are trafficking pounds of marijuana from the west coast you are one of the few people I mentioned who are profiting more than minimum wage.

How do you think drugs make it to a certain area?Someone has to do the importing, or grow locally which would make prices even cheaper. The average dealer buys his products from someone doing this. Also, a lot of people get things mailed to them, it is not difficult to make those kind of connections. What is your basis on ""the average drug dealer?"" It doesn't seem like you know any, or only know some extremely low level people that just do flips for personal stash.

Minimum wage is less than $20k a year. You're almost at that mark making $300 a week. Coke dealers or soneone selling hard drugs can make $1000+ in a single busy night at a club or festival. It's not unreasonable to see someone make $500-$1000 a week, that's not a ton of money.

>> So now you're saying your old drug dealer bought a car off the money he made from you and your friends? In high school?

>Rumor has it he bought himself a used car from his drug dealing.  I used that as an example of personally knowing someone who had the ideal market for drug dealing and likely did well.  Not everyone goes to school with rich white kids who dont know any better.

Some poor people don't know any better either. Also, you can replace students with tourists, strippers, musicians, service industry, etc. I have heard of people making double their kitchen pay by selling drugs to front of house workers at work. It happens pretty easily.

>I suppose you should read this article.

>http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/24/opinion/oe-dubner24

This is about gang members selling drugs. Not an independent dealer. Huge difference. What that article describes is a pyramid scheme, that is not how most drug dealers operate. The operation in the article involved having a ton of overhead, that is not a typical situation.

>> The problem is that it's not a sustainable model; eventually the sales people will outnumber the clients or there will be so many sales people, the market will become saturated and no sales will happen.

>Well no.  It doesnt matter to the first salesmen whether people consume the drugs or commission other people to sell the drugs.  So long as his salesmen keep pushing the drugs and people keep buying the drugs he will continue to profit.  It just makes more sense for him to commission more people to do it than to do each sale himself and that holds true for everyone else down the line.  You can waste your time trying to make 6 sales a day or you can commission 6 people to each waste their time.  

Isn't that how all retail and sales positions work? Or am I missing something?

>Sales will still happen because people want weed/drugs.

>> Most drug dealers are not actively trying to recruit more sellers.  When you walk into Rouses, does the cashier try to get you a job at the store? Or do they ring you up, make the sale, and that's it? Same concept.

>Because most of them do not have access to an amount of product that they could not move themselves.  Sysco, the food service provider, makes more money the more Rouses there are because the more product Rouses buys from Sysco, the more money Sysco makes.  So when a potential food buyer goes to Sysco they  might be told ""You should think of opening your own Rouses.""

Having product is about having money to buy said product. You act like there's some kind of supply shortage in one breath, then claim that sellers are hard pressed to sell a lot of product due to not being able to get enough customers. Which one is it, both of those things can't be true at the same time?

In a multi level marketing scenario, salesmen would recruit buyers to buy into a system and become salesmen themselves, then get paid commission for new recruits they bring to the company. Drug dealing generally is ""I bought this for $x, so I'm gonna charge you $x + $y, and you charge $z to make money. Very basic sales.

Winning the lottery isn't something you can work towards winning. That is not a sound analogy.

Selling drugs is a business just like any other business, it's just underground and illegal.

>Your entire premise is filled with so many hypotheticals.  Sure I could find a wholesaler who would consistently have an ounce for me everyday at $150 and I could consistently find 6 or 8 people a day to buy that weed at 100% markup and I could probably get away with selling that much weed and making that much money without having any encounter with the police of other criminals.  But this is the real world.  Most drug dealers dont have a wholesale connect that good.  Most drug dealers dont have 6 or 8 customers a day.  Most could not keep up a pace of business like that without some interaction with negative forces.  

Well no shit, we are talking about a hypothetical situation. Selling an ounce of weed a day is selling 2 lb a month, which is not a huge amount.

You seem like you have no clue what you are talking about. Where are you getting your data? Do you know anyone who sells drugs as a profession? Do you realize that people drive out of state to pick up drugs? That some people get drugs mailed to them? 


High grade weed is selling around $1800/lb in Colorado. If you had someone driving down pounds and paid them $1000 per lb for their troubles, you'd have a $2800 pound, which equals out to be $175/ounce. If you ship, you risk losing a package, but you probably won't have to pat much markup, so you could be getting ounces for around $125.

>So yea.  Im not saying there arent drug dealers here and in other places making bank.  Im pretty sure my high school drug dealer bought a car just from me and my group of friends.  I would imagine his success came from having a fairly stable group of white kids who would overpay for drugs and were no threat to him criminally or legally.  Even then, I dont think he was selling to 6 people a day.

So now you're saying your old drug dealer bought a car off the money he made from you and your friends? In high school? 

Strippers make a lot of cash, servers and bartenders make a good bit of cash, college kids have their parents money a lot, tourists are looking to spend money, some business people like to smoke, etc. Drug dealers sell to other dealers sometimes too.

>Selling drugs is not a literal pyramid scheme. I called it a pyramid scheme because like the ""Multi-level marketing scheme"" posted in your link, the best way to advance in the drug selling market is to find other people to sell for you.  You do better when you recruit others to take the risks and earn the least profit.  You can see the obvious parallels.  

>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing

You are wrong. Selling drugs is not multi level marketing, in fact, multi level marketing can be the model someone uses, but anyone can use any business model to sell drugs! Multi level marketing is when you have a salesman making sales, and recruiting new people for the job. The first salesman makes a commission for all products sold by the salesmen he recruits. So if he gets 5 people to jump on board with him, he gets money any time they make a sale. The problem is that it's not a sustainable model; eventually the sales people will outnumber the clients or there will be so many sales people, the market will become saturated and no sales will happen.

Someone can use that model to sell drugs, but it would be very stupid because the more drug dealers that hit the scene, the less money everyone makes bc of higher competition and market saturation. 

Generally, people buy a large amount of drugs outright from a wholesaler, or get drugs on loan from a dealer, which causes them to pay higher prices. That is how every retail business works. Most drug dealers are not actively trying to recruit more sellers. When you walk into Rouses, does the cashier try to get you a job at the store? Or do they ring you up, make the sale, and that's it? Same concept.

If you are fronting or loaning product to someone, you are assuming financial risks, not unlike a store giving a salesman product to sell. The difference is that legal business has resources such as insurance and law enforcement to prevent theft and loss of goods.

cvn2lgb,0,t1_cvmzj91,lv89,"Well we can start with the definition of mental illness itself, which states ""mental illness is a condition that impacts a person's thinking, feeling or mood and may affect his or her ability to relate to others and function on a daily basis. Each person will have different experiences, even people with the same diagnosis."" (https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions)

Mass shooting is not a normal stress response. A sane, rational person does not see killing many innocent people as the right thing to do. I do not think that mental health reasons are the sole cause, but it's unreasonable to argue that the people committing these crimes are mentally sound.

 When you pair disordered thought patters with other elements such as injustice (perceived or real), discrimination, poor financial resources, relationship problems, or other kinds of stress, it can cause irrational behaviors. For example, if someone has a severe socal anxiety disorder, standing in a line of people at a check out counter can be overwhelming to the point of a panic attack. The disorder itself didn't directly cause the panic attack, standing in a crowded line was the trigger. For most people, this would not be a major issue. If the disorder was treated, standing in line would not be a major issue for this person, but due to the disorder, it became an extremely difficult feat.

You could apply the above example to a mass shooter. Said shooter has an undiagnosed mental condition, then a series of events happen in the shooter's life which he perceives as unfair and not favorable to him. Rage builds and he blames society, then this snowballs into wanting to take action against this perceived injustice society  has burdened him with. While a well adjusted person has healthy coping mechanisms in place, the shooter does not. Think of the movie Taxi Driver, a similar scenario in real life would be plausible, as far as the way Robert DeNiro's character felt.

At the end of the day, there are usually multiple reasons that people commit these crimes. It's important to examine one's mental health in situations where it's likely that said individual is not stable. Also, just because a mental disorder contributed to someone's actions, IT IS IN NO MEANS AN EXCUSE FOR COMMITTING HORRENDOUS ACTS. It is unacceptable to have killing outbursts. Just because soneone is mentally ill does not mean that they can't decipher between right and wrong, nor does it mean they are insane or can plead insanity in court. 

This is an interesting article I found on the subject. It's an interview with a professor from Duke. In a nutshell, he believes that if gun control background checks more thorough screened for mental disorders, it would have an impact on violent crime:

cvn1gad,0,t1_cvn062h,lv89,"An ounce of weed isn't what I'd consider ""weight,"" but I guess that is a matter of opinion. Regardless, in a place where our 8 parish metro area consist of 1.25 million people, that has many colleges, and in a place that is fueled on tourism and partying, it is not difficult to sell an ounce of weed in a day. 

 Instead of saying 6 eights, maybe our imagined hustler sells 2 half ounces a day, or 4 quarters a day. Maybe some days he sells 3 ounces, some days he sells none. I know people that smoje about an ounce a month. That breaks down to a little bit less than a gram a day, so thats an 8th every 3-5 days basically. If you know 10 people with those smoking habits, you are already at 20 bags every week with regular customers coming back. If you have good shit or good prices, they will recommend you to their friends, and so on. You could go out to most venues here and meet new people who smoke, exchange numbers, and you have new customers. Maybe sell a few bags at the show too, if a group of 4 people wants to get high, they can each throw in a few dollars and easily buy an eighth. 

The entire point was that it's possible to make more money selling drugs then working a low level job. 

We are going to have to agree to disagree because our ideas on the subject apparently differ greatly. I felt as though I very clearly outlined the theoretical situation, but you do not agree with my calculations. I don't know how I can spell it out more clearly than I already have. You can choose to believe it's impossible, but I'm letting you know that it is entirely within the realm of possibility.

Apparently you did not read the link on pyramid schemes, so let me quote it for you:

""A pyramid scheme is an unsustainable and often illegal business model that involves promising participants payment or services, primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, rather than supplying any real investment or sale of products or services to the public.""

Weed is a consumable, there is constant demand, and you don't have to enroll into a group to get it. You find someone who has it, buy it, flip it, and keep the profit. Selling drugs works exactly the same as any other retail business. If it is considered a pyramid scheme, then are grocery stores a pyramid scheme too? It's harder for the small grocers to make as much profit and the people on top make much more money...
