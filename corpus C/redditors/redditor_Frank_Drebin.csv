cvxqzbj,0,t1_cvxo6rb,Frank_Drebin,I'm pretty sure it was after 2007 because I found out abOut it on this sub.  May be as late as 2012.,2,0,1444705647,1444723706
cvx1wdx,0,t1_cvwrmkv,Frank_Drebin,Appreciate the attempts but it is more recent then something evil.  I think it was an independent film,2,0,1444667651,1444723706
cvx1u16,0,t1_cvwwtb0,Frank_Drebin,Neither of those but people are now giving me many cabin horror movies I haven't seen yet.  I might watch those anyway,2,0,1444667550,1444723706
cvx1s6l,0,t1_cvwugxm,Frank_Drebin,No but I might have to watch that now,1,0,1444667468,1444723706
cvwptkl,0,t1_cvwobq9,Frank_Drebin,Not yet.  I found out about this movie on this sub several years ago so I have hope,1,0,1444634742,1444723706
cvi5rg7,0,t1_cvh65xg,Frank_Drebin,"FTL is kinda like that but the progression comes from learning the game rather then stats or equipment since that resets every death.

It took me 46 tries to beat the boss on hard.",0,0,1443540932,1444723706
cvi5lsd,0,t1_cvi0ijv,Frank_Drebin,"Overall I found it better then witcher 2.

Combat is more fluid with the dodge mechanic and roll mechanic being separate.

The story is really well done for a video game.

The world is far better then witcher 2 and the characters are the best I've seen in a video game.

If you are prepared for the amount of time you have to dedicate for it (I took 3 days off of work, planned ahead and everything because I knew what I was getting into) it's up there with the best video games of all time IMO.

The only downside is that the game can feel like a fucking marathon trying to complete everything especially for the first play.",2,0,1443540687,1444723706
cvdzgj9,0,t1_cvdzcme,Frank_Drebin,Understandable.  Given the sheer output of games on steam I was surprised no-one has taken break from pixelated adventure games and 2d platformers to try an adult educational approach.,0,0,1443203867,1444723706
cvdym4c,0,t1_cvdya4n,Frank_Drebin,"True.  Last time half of us went home on furlough (they ended up getting backpaid) and the rest of us worked through it and were told we would be paid but when was not known.

The real danger is losing employees all together.  There is a fairly intensive training program for my job which qualifies us for better non government jobs.  The stability makes the federal job more appealing.  Take away the stability and people might start leaving even more frequently then they do already.

They would have to hire a bunch of people to make up for those leaving which would lead to more mistakes and probably a long term cost increase from the additional training and inevitable fuck ups by new people. ",5,0,1443202578,1444723706
cvdtn8a,1,t3_3mcazu,Frank_Drebin,I'm a federal employee and could face a furlough.  My job has nothing to do with the bullshit they want to shut the government down for so that kinda pisses me off.  My job is secure enough thay im fairly certain we won't get laid off but other federal employees may be facing that possibility.,17,0,1443194925,1444723706
