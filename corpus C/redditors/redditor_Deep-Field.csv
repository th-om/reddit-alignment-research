cv2pbfv,0,t1_cv2nhcy,Deep-Field,">ISIS cannot fight a war with any of its neighbors, neighbors who's armies are well trained and battle hardened. Other than The Sunni areas of Syria and Iraq, they are stunted

This isn't about battle hardened soldiers, this is about the appetite of isis' neighbors to wage a prolonged and bloody counter insurgency campaign to prop up the Syrian and Iraqi states. History is replete with examples of battle hardened militaries that were stifled and repelled by much less sophisticated but zealous insurgencies. If Isis can't expand militarily, they will certainly do it ideologically, supporting insurgencies and terror cells to destabilize the region and fill the vacuum themselves.  Terror groups in the region and abroad are already pledging their loyalty to Isis, given the chance isis will support them with any means available.

cv2jpu4,0,t1_cv2ew66,Deep-Field,"By that logic, the Nazi's would have become a moderate state after awhile. The problem is tolerating the ""after awhile"" period. A ""state"" such as isis predicated on a genocidal mandate is going to export that philosophy beyond their borders as a matter of national security. They are (rightfully) surrounded by enemies and it's in their benefit to destabilize the region and fill the power vacuum themselves. Terror groups all over the world are already pledging their allegiance to isis. You think that if we say ""fine just stay in your little slice of desert"" Isis is going to stop trying to expand? The entire legitimacy of the group relies on replicating the caliphate and spreading their brand of sharia law. Stability is their enemy.

If we turn a blind eye to what they are doing to their own people, were going to end up dealing with them eventually anyway, only after they've already murdered countless innocents. We have to wipe out the cancer before it spreads, never giving them a moments pause. No rest for the wicked.
