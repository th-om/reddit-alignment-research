I still haven't had to buy a jail.

Tourism/Leisure doesn't seem to change anything.

Tourism in general is still worthless.

Night/Day sliders are worthless

Night/Day traffic difference is negligible ",5,0,1444662346,1444717976

>Theres a video just search on youtube. It shows the kid alone doing nothing pretty much for a while and than a cruiser pulls up next to him and a cop jumps out with gun in hand and shoots him at near point blank range literally 2 seconds after he gets out.

Well that just isn't true. He was pointing a fake gun at people and twirling it around.",2,0,1444599369,1444717976

Probably not a good idea when they think you have a gun.

What does this have to do with anything?

That takes it out of the realm of a ""difficult"" issue and into the realm of a ""racial"" one. Gotta watch those code words. 

What are you talking about?

>Both Democratically controlled urban...oases? Thank you for reinforcing my point. Still, compared to much of Chicago, Rockford, East St. Louis, etc. an argument can be made that they are, at least so far as gun crime goes... Again, the salient point is that gun control has proven that it isn't effective and real-world limitations mean that ""get the guns"" is never going to happen in a workable manner.

I don't have a workable answer to the problem other than each of us needs to look inside and ask whether or not we could do the hard but right thing if it came down to one of our family members. Perhaps you have some suggestions? 

I have no idea. What signs do these mass shooters show? Should we just incarcerate all social outcasts? This is a very difficult issue. 


>Yep, and the gun violence problem doesn't seem to be nearly as severe in either state as it is in Illinois. See, the same data, from a different perspective, can have radically different meaning. That's what I was talking about when I said that it's time for the anti-gun advocates to take a long hard look at their arguments and the mistakes they have been making before continuing to gnash their teeth and rail at the moon every time one of these mass killings happens. 


Gary and Milwaukee are pretty terrible places.
