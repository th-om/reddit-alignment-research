The rich get richer while the poor get poorer yet there is no evidence that the rich work harder or the poor are slacking. This means capitalism's core tenet of hard work is rewarded financially is disproven, hard work in capitalism makes other people money.",1,0,1444688752,1444726180

The problem I see is not fundamentally with the EU (although there is room for more democracy), it is with us. As a country we are not prepared to properly engage and work with the EU to achieve our objective. We are the angry kid kicking and screaming in the corner and it achieves nothing for anybody. I also can't see this changing because we have many people in the UK who reject rather than embrace globalism and debate is not changing minds here.

So, since we can't continue kicking and screaming while being credible, we either leave or fully engage and the current questions being asked means that being asked to fully engage isn't on the cards.",-3,0,1444672190,1444726180

Take the problem we have of  legal highs, in the US they are banned before they are ever created because they wrote the law to adapt. Here, because we have to expressly ban things, we have unscrupulous chemists making legal highs and killing people and it takes years for Government to respond.

Any law that attracts loophole finders needs to be given the catch all to stop them. Laws that don't have habitual loophole finders don't need that so shouldn't have it.",1,0,1444606302,1444726180

cvwakls,0,t1_cvw9r87,Rhaegarion,"Facebook benefit from laws that govern how information may be shared. It increased confidence in their user base that the information cannot be abused. They also benefit from laws such as The Computer Misuse Act which makes hacking a criminal offense, it would be open season on the internet without those laws.

To be able to use facebook one needs to be competent at reading and writing, they also need to know how to use computers. The UK has formally educated people in IT since the 70's leading to multiple generations of users who can just pick up and go.

As for infrastructure, firstly it is important to define maintenence. To me a big part of that is protection to which we must credit the Armed Forces, without them we wouldn't have anything, it would have been seized by whatever enemy wanted it. On a less grand scale, the widespread access to the internet enjoyed by the country has been made possible through multiple government interventions. Without subsidies for supplying remote locations and actions such as breaking up BT to promote competition we would not have the highspeed infrastructure of today.

These are not trifling issues, and they are expensive.
