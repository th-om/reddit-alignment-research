cvx84yt,1,t3_3ohbjk,littlebitsoffluff,"I disagree with other commentators here. I think that we are indeed moving away from rugged individualism, both true individualism and self-perceived individualism.

I argue against the notion that ""rugged individualism"" never existed. I still think it exists in great numbers today. But there is a growing percentage of the population who really would be lost without some authority telling them what to do.

""True individualism"": these are the people who eked out a life in Kansas during the Dustbowl. They were the ones that moved further and further away inward from the coasts into the center of the continent just to get away from other people. My small town in Pennsylvania was founded by a guy who moved there because someone else had moved within a day's travel distance from him. Then when someone else moved within 12 miles of him, he considered that too close, so he packed up and left for even more rural parts.

Obviously those days are (mostly) gone. But the spirit that embodied those pioneers lived on and was valorized for centuries after.

Which leads to my next point: there was a time when people aspired to be individualists. In A Fierce Discontent, for example, the author describes how the ""self-made man"" was the epitome and role model for men in the Victorian age in the U.S. This was gradually challenged by original Progressivism. To some extent it did not matter if people aspiring to such models were true individualists or not; that was the target they were shooting for, and their behavior and actions were shaped accordingly.

We are at this time, however, a long way from Kennedy's ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country"" (not that Kennedy was promoting individualism per se with that statement). In my opinion, many people expect to be ""taken care of"" to some greater or lesser extent, and are angry and disturbed when the world does not conform to their expectations. Many of these types would be helpless if taken outside their comfort zone. To give an illustration, my father, back in 1947 or so as a man of roughly 25, had a railroad flatcar of building materials delivered to an isolated spot in Pennsylvania. He single-handedly cut down the trees, blew up boulders with dynamite, cleared the space, dug the foundation, and built a house completely from scratch, all without electricity and water. He pooped in a bucket until he got the septic system working. That is rugged individualism that I don't believe many (including myself) would have a clue how to perform today.

cvwwhcc,1,t3_3oencb,littlebitsoffluff,"I hang out with a lot of very conservative, religious people (although am not much so myself). In the last few years, I've noted that they have pretty much given up lambasting the gays for the most part. They don't care if people are gay like they did in the old days. They might not like it much but it's a ""live and let live"" attitude. They know they've lost that battle, in any event. In that regard they are no longer bigots (painting with a very broad brush obviously).

What DOES drive them crazy is the idea of gay marriage. They believe that two gays marrying somehow undermines the sanctity of their marriage. THAT is what they're mostly pissed off about these days. Unless you're looking closely, the two seem to be the same, however. ",1,0,1444658317,1444716318
cvwwc3p,1,t3_3oeybb,littlebitsoffluff,">I was wondering what are some of the basic gun control measures that you all would agree with?

I can't think of any additional measures that could be put in place that I'd be comfortable with without ""the other side"" giving something up in return. But when the other side talks about ""compromise,"" it's typically not true compromise they mean. They just want to know what more they can take away without giving anything back (like national reciprocity or whatever). 

The reason that gun control laws have sort of petered out at this point is because we've reached a point where any new laws will affect MILLIONS of gun owners, not hundreds or thousands. You can make laws that defy hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of peoples' wishes--and they have, those are the laws on the books now--but when you try to change millions of peoples' lives, that's when you run into resistance. Which is where we're at. There's no more room to give. ",4,0,1444658009,1444716318
cvwuvrw,1,t3_3of7i5,littlebitsoffluff,"My position is somewhat odd and complex. I am not anti-abortion. But I do believe that stopping a fertilized egg from developing is let's call it ""truncating a life,"" which is more or less the same as killing it. My reasoning is that even if the fetus is not ""viable"" at that moment, if left alone without intervention, in nine months you will have a viable human being. Yes, the woman's body may choose to abort the fetus on its own (for its own unknown reasons), but that is not in our purview. Morality is a human characteristic and our explicit intervention--or choice not to intervene--is a moral decision. I believe life begins at moment of conception.

Now, on the flip side, in the practical world, it's very messy. We got too many unwanted babies in the world. If every unwanted fertilized egg was brought to term, there would be just that many more unwanted babies. Then, too, I understand the argument that a woman should have a right to do what she wants with her body. What are we going to do, force women to give birth to babies they don't want? Are we going to put doctors and women in jail who perform or receive abortions? I don't want to live in that kind of totalitarian society.

In the end, abortion is ultimately a selfish act, because you are choosing to terminate a potential life so that you can avoid some little or some great amount of hardship that the new baby would engender. I have a nine-year-old that was a ""surprise"" to us. Briefly considered abortion, decided that the nurturing instinct we felt had already grown to encompass this minuscule mass of cells. Now he and I go on great hikes together and we chase the dog around the yard and such. What an empty spot I would have if we'd made the simple decision to abort.

But that is just us. Not every unexpected kid gets to have a caring parent. Maybe it's just as well some kids are not allowed to develop into fully actualized humans. I don't know, it's truly beyond my ability to fairly judge.

The somewhat sad answer seems to be to me that human life is very cheap at its beginning. It is easy to snuff out, and there may be good reasons to snuff it out. But it is life, or at least I think it is. To deny that would be to be fooling myself, rationalizing.

What is the answer? --Birth control. Lots and lots of birth control, whatever the form. I'm not a big abstinence advocate, but I suppose that is a viable alternative too (if it works). ",3,0,1444654581,1444716318
