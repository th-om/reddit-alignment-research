cvnxoo6,0,t1_cvnu41d,ColdPhaedrus,"Charity is all well and good, but the resources of any particular charity pale in comparison to what the federal government can bring to bear. Besides, charities very often come with their own baggage, especially as pertains to social minorities and pariahs (Catholic church, Salvation Army, etc.). The government is constrained by the Constitution not to discriminate.

Government-run healthcare (Medicare) is actually extremely efficient compared to private alternatives. Higher education and student loan debt is a problem, but government is more the enabler in that situation then the cause of the problem.

Not sure why you put defense contractors on the list; aren't they private entities? Besides, how many times have you seen a news story about a Republican clamoring for a piece of hardware that the military doesn't particularly want. Good ol' B1 Bob springs to mind.

The deficit is a problem yes, but a long term one the Republicans pretend is a short-term one when they aren't in power to win votes. Then when they get in power they explode it. Look at the Republican candidates tax plans, all are projected by non-partisan groups to expand the deficit by trillions. Seems like the Dems have the edge on that issue.",3,0,1443978864,1444719403

Polls have consistently shown pro-life support growing until the last few years when it's been stagnant at about 50/50. How do you expect to protect one of the most important achievements in women's rights without reversing the trend? How else do you change the trend without changing minds?

And what makes you think the people who don't vote will agree with you if they do vote?

Oh, and [here's](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/nyregion/05rabbi.html?referrer=) your ""losing strategy."" Yup, it's hopeless alright. No sense engaging with those people.

You don't owe it to democracy to engage with those you disagree with. If you want to win, REALLY win, you owe it only to yourself.

EDIT: Bonus Terry Pratchett quote about assuming ""The People"" are on your side:

""People on the side of The People always ended up disappointed, in any case. They found that The People tended not to be grateful or appreciative or forward-thinking or obedient.

In this thread I've been accused of being a ""brogressive"" because I think petty name calling is stupid, now you think I'm a concern troll because... why exactly? Because I'm a liberal and I want to win? Not just winning little battles by scorching the Earth, but by winning the big battle that you only win with hearts and minds. Some of you in this thread are so short-sighted that you can't see the big picture. All of these lovely things you want to do, all it will take to undo them is one Republican president.

Unless.

Unless we move the conversation. Unless we mold a new consensus. And we don't do that with stupid schoolyard bullshit. It's cringe-inducing. I have an infant daughter. For her sake, I want to win and win permanently. You guys are content to stay on your high horses and feel smug by scoring points off the other side. I want to bring the other side onto my side and petty name-calling, hyper-partisanship, and intellectual snobbery is the WORST fucking thing the left can do right now because it confirms all the most effective attacks the right levels at us, it's one of the reasons the Overton window is so far to the right it's hard to even see it from where I stand.

cv8zaxf,0,t1_cv8yx5p,ColdPhaedrus,I think the problem with your stance is the elevation of ideology over pragmatism. I care less about intent in the political sphere are more about results.

cv8z5w7,0,t1_cv8uysu,ColdPhaedrus,">To an extent but like the other person says, this line of reasoning is really obtuse or at the very least naive. The validity (moral or otherwise) of a given policy position doesn't have anything to do with how convincing it is.

The validity of a position has an immense amount to do with how many people can be convinced to support it. That doesn't make it right. It makes it a democracy.

>Yeah, I would be afraid of ""losing"" to ideologies like fascism or even just ""brogressivism"" because they'd make society dangerous and/or extremely unpleasant for me and for many people in general.

Yeah, fear is a great reaction. Nothing bad or counter-productive ever came from people who were afraid. If you're afraid you can't be more convincing than a fascist, that's your problem, not mine. Plus, ""brogressivism? Really, it's an ideology now? I thought it was just schoolyard name-calling.

>This reminds me of people suggesting that schools teach ""both sides"" of the evolution vs. creationism debate.

It should be taught. Just not in a science class.

>Now obviously something like feminism or anti-racism is a lot more contentious than that but personally I feel like I really don't need to or should have to give anti-feminists or racists the time of day in order to argue about who's right.

This is just thinly veiled intellectual snobbery and that kind of thinking has gotten the left in trouble before.

>Please, this is simply an outrageous position to take. I SHOULD welcome opposition?

YES. Because having a functional opposition is essential even in a non-parliamentary system like ours. It makes a democracy legitimate. Look at our government now. A huge part of the dysfunction is because one party cynically resorts to demagoguery and petty personal attacks instead of open and honest debate. The modern GOP is classic example of the need for a loyal opposition. Every smart commentary from the left has bemoaned the demise of sane opposition on the right, not exulted in their impending descent into political non-relevance, because democracies are only healthy when many viewpoints are represented. The only lasting solution is more political involvement from a diverse range of viewpoints, not less.

I agree having one side win doesn't automatically make them right. It's a democracy, not Magical Progressive Fairy-Land. News flash, we're going to lose the debate sometimes. It doesn't mean acting like little shits about it is a good idea.

So when you resort to mockery and schoolyard bullshit, don't pretend you're making anything better. You're not better than the other side. You've sunk to their level.",0,0,1442842632,1444719403
cv8shm5,0,t1_cv8s6bt,ColdPhaedrus,"It's not about wanting them to succeed. Part of having a healthy democracy is having honest debates. Saying that you want to have an honest debate is basically saying ""I think I'm right, but I'm willing to admit the possibility that I'm not, and if someone can convince me they have a better idea I'm willing to modify my position.""

Saying you don't want people you sometimes disagree with to be politically active is an expression of weakness on your part. It betrays a weakness of your convictions, a fear that you will lose, an admission that you are unwilling to accept the possibility that someone with a different opinion is right or knows a better way to do things.

If you were really confident in your positions you should welcome opposition because in the end your side is that much stronger from you having to argue and adapt and think deeper about your points, and you'd be a better debater and more able to bring about the change you want.",0,0,1442817528,1444719403
