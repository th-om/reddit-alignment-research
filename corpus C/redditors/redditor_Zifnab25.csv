Horseshit.  This is the same ""Nope to Change"" rhetoric that gets pitched at Obama.  The first two years of the Clinton administration were extremely progressive.  After '94, the major change was *congress*, not the Presidency.  Bill was the shining star of liberal success in an era where liberal politicians were being driven out of office in droves.  He *continues* to be a champion of progressive causes through his charitable efforts.

> I'll hold no more ill will toward her if she wins than I would if she loses. It just means that I'll likely be finding a republican to vote third party with me so I don't have to counter someone else.

Going the Ralph Nader route.  This is exactly what dicked us in 2000.  Liberals claimed Al Gore didn't care about environmentalism as much as the Green Party did.  Not only were they totally wrong, but their wrongness handed the election to the oil industry.

> Is it such a ludicrous thing to ask that people just voice their opinions so we can choose someone we think has the best ideas instead of the person best at quietly following the lead?

It is when you use conservative FUD to justify undermining liberal politicians for the sin of making moderate noises during the election season.  ""Al Gore isn't green enough"" / ""Hillary Clinton likes banks more than workers"" / ""Obama is just like Bush, he sold us out"".

It's this shit that gets us '10 and '14 and '00 and '94.  Vote for whom you please, but drop the ""Hillary is terrible because conservatives told me she's not pure enough"".",1,0,1444695344,1444732262

Both are contracts which traditionally bind people by law.  One can be *nullified* by the state you reside in without the consent of either signing party.

Contracts are binding on signatories.  Both non-competes and union contracts bind people under law, in states where contracts are upheld.",-1,0,1444694856,1444732262

cvxifqh,0,t1_cvxhqt4,Zifnab25,"Bush claimed that his opposition to our deployment in Kosovo made him dovish.  He played the ""Compassionate Conservative"" card repeatedly in '99/'00 to build his reputation as a more-liberalish conservative.  Lots of moderates fell for it.

I don't think the GOP can run a ""compassionate conservative"" in 2016.  But I do think we could see a similar ""that liberal is just as bad but worse than our conservative!"" game plan rolled out.  And I can see moderates falling for it again, particularly if liberals are shanking Hillary because she had the audacity to get more votes in the Dem primary.

Clinton is running a defensive campaign because she thinks she has a strong enough ground game to win primary and general without opening herself up to wedge issues because of something she said to outflank Sanders in the primary.  Again, that's smart.  Hillary's brand is moderate.  ""How dare you shelter yourself from controversy!"" is such a senseless accusation.  Why would you be mad at a candidate for deliberately *avoiding gaffs*?",1,0,1444692201,1444732262
