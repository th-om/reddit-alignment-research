You can't expect a single organisation to ""solve"" LGBT issues overnight. Yes, it's only damage control. Yes, we deserve better. But it's **essential** some people focus on letting those kids know they're not alone, because LGBT teenagers have a [**massive** suicide rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_among_LGBT_youth).

cugajn9,0,t1_cufknz6,lowcarb123,"**DISCLAIMER: Not all of the following is my personal opinion. I'm merely trying to give you guys some insight on why some people do not vote.**

> The lack of young people voting damages democracy IMO.

Elections are a tool to legitimize governements. Some people think the current system is broken and prefer not to vote for any party because there's no option on the ballot for ""none of the above"".

This may seem foolish when undesirable parties get elected, but I would argue that voting won't stop the problem as long as the state is unwilling to update the election process. Plus, there's no efficient way to differentiate protesters from indifferent people.

Not voting kinda has the merit of showing there's a problem. Sadly, the government won't budge on this issue and prefers telling people who believe the election system is broken that voting will fix the issue and that ""you can't complain if you didn't vote"".

See some of the comments on [Not voting isn't Rebellion, it's Surrender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlb7Eg4urpw): (Youtube comments, I know, I know...)

> * Voting is statistically meaningless / only serves to make you feel like you've accomplished something

>* Policies are the same on most issues / nobody is pushing for what I want

>* Politicians aren't accountable to their promises

>* Etc.
