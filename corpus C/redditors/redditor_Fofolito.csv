Its nasally, enunciated, and precise so that it can be picked up by the microphones and translated to speakers with clarity. As mentioned by /u/cokevanillazero its called the [Trans-Atlantic Accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent)",7,0,1444668031,1444722539
cvwg34h,0,t1_cvw12zt,Fofolito,"The first time I tripped Shrooms it was because they were available at a house party of my friends and people i was familiar with. I wasn't looking for anything other than to try them and to have fun. It ended up being really cool because i felt a nearly indescribable brevity in my soul; like the crushing weight of my depression had been lifted. It was temporary and wore off with the Shrooms but I wanted to feel that again if only for the temporary respite from my suffering. I did it a couple more times recreationally and it wasnt until my fourth or so I had my revelation.

 I'm not a hippie, I'm not a New Age Spiritualist, and I've only ever smoked weed because I was self-medicating and not because I thought it was some sort of God given miracle so when I had my revelation it came as a series of thoughts out of the  norm for me. The shrooms allowed me to look at things from outside myself (a big step in recovering from any depression wherein your focus draws inward and your frame of reference narrows). My revelation came as I sat staring at a mountain in my home town I've seen a million times. I've always known it was big because it looms right over the town and I've climbed and hiked parts of it many times. As I stared at it though its sheer imensity hit me. 

I thought of the mass of the rock I was looking at, at the mass of the rock beneath that, at the age of the rocks, and that all led to me thinking about the size and scale of the world and the planet and of the Universe itself. Then there was me: I'm small. I'm very, very small and though my problems and the things that stressed me out were real, they too were small. I was insignificant to the vast order of things not only here on the planet but in terms of the Universe itself. 

That insignificance was life saving. It lifted my burdens and helped me start coping with my depression. The things that wigged me out weren't all that daunting anymore and I started to recover over the next few months. 

I didn't have a doctor dosing me, I didn't have a spirit-guide or a guru coaching me through my trips, I was just a young 20 something that wanted to feel something, anything, and shrooms sounded fun. I didn't go into them looking for a cure but in them I found a temporary relief in their effects and they ultimately led me to having the most life affecting thought I've yet had. Drugs may not be your answer but it can't hurt to try them in moderation. Keep your mind open, your body in a safe place, and enjoy the ride.",1,0,1444612891,1444722539
cvvulo6,0,t1_cvvmksu,Fofolito,"I credit my recovery to Magic Mushrooms. I tried them a few times back during my last bout and I had a profound moment of cosmic understanding: I'm small and insignificant and so are all of my problems and that's okay. I don't have a purpose or a drive in life but I came out of depression nearly two years ago now and I'm doing alright. I'm not telling you drugs are the answer, I'm just saying that in my case the mind expanding effects of psychodelics allowed me a perspective outside that of my insular, self-critical, and avoidant norm. That was the key: getting outside of myself. ",3,0,1444576747,1444722539

I don't dislike the guy and infact I'm grateful that he did what he did but let's not act like he didn't break any number of huge secrecy laws. Those laws exist, they are legal and constitutional, and they are there for a reason. The guy is a martyr but you don't get to be a martyr without the penalties. Snowden broke the law for us and now he gets to live out his life in Russia. Can't say I envy him.",-4,0,1444164736,1444722539

cviijr3,0,t1_cvih8wj,Fofolito,"But we don't. You claim ""those who say we are a Republic are wrong... We are a Liberal Democracy"". Yes, a Liberal Democracy can be a Republic which is a form of democracy but your own words show we are not in agreement. Not all rectangles are squares: we are a Constitutional Republic which is based on a form of Democracy but it is *more* accurate to describe us as a Republic than it is as a Democracy of any sort because we have a government by proxy representation and not direct representation. Liberal in the context of Liberal Democracy refers to the constitutional foundation of our government rather than its form. ",1,0,1443559224,1444722539
