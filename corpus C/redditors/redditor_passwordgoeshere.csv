cvxc80t,0,t1_cvxbhz4,passwordgoeshere,"I think the best explanation is that what they are doing is not intrinsically good but what's happening to black people is so much worse that it shouldn't matter.

That being said, to what end should this be done? Should everyone just start interrupting famous people to raise awareness for a cause?",0,0,1444682606,1444723104

cvuaf0o,0,t1_cvu7lvb,passwordgoeshere,"Ok, we could go back and forth a hundred times clarifying but for time's sake I will agree that I don't really understand what they are saying.

I don't see anything they are doing as constructive. It's very very easy to yell at people and disrupt meetings and cause chaos. It's difficult to run for office and understand laws and change the system we have. I mentioned Obama not to say 'hooray racism never existed' but to say that here is someone who did work within the system that was not designed for him and was able to make some positive changes. 

We don't live in the 1800s. Black people are going to college and running for office and making slow progress. They can work within the system and help shape reforms they way they see fit.

cvu6sbj,0,t1_cvu62n9,passwordgoeshere,"I've already quoted the relevant lines. They say they want to dismantle the system. They don't think black people should benefit from the system. The very rally they interrupted was celebrating social security. They don't think MLK is relevant or Civil Rights is relevant to today. 

The very fact that that minorities of any kind have any power is because of the government. I don't think they realize how vulnerable all of these marginalized people would be if that were taken away. I don't think they realize how much better America is in that aspect than other countries. Not perfect, but way better. I don't think they understand how much better America is and how much it has changed in the last few decades even. They don't mention Obama at all because he disproves everything in that last quote. The system wasn't meant for him but he conformed to it and he did get elected and he became one of the most powerful guys in the world.
