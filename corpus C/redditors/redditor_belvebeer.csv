cvxqa39,1,t3_3oj6pt,belvebeer,"Gotta be a game-time decision. May be something like a limited snap count.

If that's the case we're going to need Williams to make a statement this game. Hopefully Hank will be healthy too.",1,0,1444704512,1444719507

cvxewjy,0,t1_cvxervn,belvebeer,"Checkdowns and screens are pass plays, not run. Those often involve different personnel. Checkdowns are often the result of the secondary being covered or QBs like Weeden who can't throw more than a certain range. That's why backs like Vereen, Randle, Thompson, and Sproles are able to get passes behind the defensive line where the linebackers need to contain them. In those plays it is a pass defense you are analyzing, not a run defense.  ",4,0,1444686558,1444719507
