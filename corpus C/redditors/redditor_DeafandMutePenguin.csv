cvxdqaw,0,t1_cvxbz7n,DeafandMutePenguin,"I didn't read the comment wrong.  The commentor before me stated it was not ""a political video"" and the discussion was where it should be posted.  I chimed in and said it's not political so /r/politics was not appropriate.  I suggested /r/standup.  It's completely in line with the discussion of where it should be posted.  You chimed in.  I'm not embarrassed by my comment because I didn't read it wrong.  

Edit: the only confusion I had was I thought in my 2nd comment that you were the person I had replied to.  You weren't.  So where I do make a mistake I'm willing to own up to.  Also go fuck yourself.

I'm not taking anything out on you other than you being a faggot.",1,0,1444684755,1444720277

cvx8ml7,1,t3_3og6dx,DeafandMutePenguin,"It's clear he didn't want Ant.  Its a fact that it was Opie who was talking about them going their separate ways years before.  

If Opie wanted Ant to be brought back he 1) would not have resigned.  2) would have used the show as a mouthpiece for Ant being brought back.  

Nothing is more powerful than the company airing out a voice on their airwaves calling for the company to bring back a personality.

No, Opie thought for sure he could keep the audience by himself and a rotation of comedians.  When it became clear that wasn't working he decided to rebrand the show into something with wider appeal.  That's why he brought in the Stangles, and now focuses on shit the audience could give a shit about like documentaries.",5,0,1444677506,1444720277
