The Government can't change specific parts of the agreement, so if Labour would like them to do so then they are either disingenuous or stupid.

So Labour need to look at the agreement and decide if it will be beneficial or detrimental **overall**. Otherwise it is nitpicking.

[Andrew Little is making noises about it failing 4/5 of their bottom lines anyway.](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11527509) So I don't anticipate them supporting it. They better be hoping that any benefits aren't showing up in time for the 2017 election.

Only a day ago he was wanting to [look at trade deals with Indo and India,](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/72904296/andrew-little-bigger-gains-for-dairy-in-india-and-indonesia-than-tppa) yet what country in their right mind would negotiate with a Govt that doesn't stick to their deals as it is?",1,0,1444648033,1444717496
