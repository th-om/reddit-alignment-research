I just won a match 5-0 with an enemy surrender as Hades against Sol in solo. In support, if she has a guardian you can focus on getting magical protection first, giving you a big leg up on the enemy support.",1,0,1444708567,1444718242

cvxhwem,0,t1_cvwavdw,Yahspetsnaz,What we all want is a Paradox strategy game with Total War's real time battles.,2,0,1444691319,1444718242
cvxhsgy,0,t1_cvvxdu4,Yahspetsnaz,"Total War has a campaign map about as techinical as Civ, but the main draw is the real time battles. Instead of two unit avatars fighting each other, your armies load into a big RTS battle where you command units of about 160 men each (depending on unit type and settings). It isn't as deep in the strategy department, but it is much more visceral and intense than EU.",1,0,1444691138,1444718242

cvxabfq,1,t3_3offl4,Yahspetsnaz,"There are real applications to the techniques themselves (this is given we have a good school and good instruction, which I've heard is tough to come by in Krav Maga) but you simply can't get good at fighting without sparring. You may think all the stuff you learn works in your head, but until you simulate a fight with it, there is no way to know. In the case of military and police forces that use these, they also take extensive physical training and boxing alongside so they are going to be far more effective at the defense than someone who just wants to know where to place his hands to perform a grapple. I'm sure all of those styles have fantastic schools around, and I'm sure they also have some McDojos.",1,0,1444679919,1444718242
