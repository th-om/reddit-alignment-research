cvv9u89,1,t3_3o9s8t,Bassoon_Commie,"You're basically just seeing how you can make plays. Look for what you see being used often- or more importantly, what never sees use or is only useful in a certain scenario. That will help you learn what to take out- either out of the deck entirely or what to side deck. If you want to know how to play against specific decks, find people playing those decks and duel them. If you're just looking to see how it works without any real threat, you could try any rogue deck (I think my chaos Blue-Eyes/Red-Eyes decks have been used by other people as tests for their own.)

In regards to trials, there isn't a set number. I'm still trying to make a functional Black Luster Soldier deck (been tinkering with it for some time) but only needed to playtest

once from the walkthrough the original train player provided. Deck was more or less fine where it was. Similar thing with Chaos Red-Eyes- I had done enough research that I could build something that more or less worked at its best.

Research helps make deckbuilding easier. If you're cookie-cutting another deck, testing might be shorter in duration.",1,0,1444520614,1444716522

Also some tips on vehicle setups and a bit on combat. Most of this is based on my personal experience as a pilot:

* In my experience, the easiest secondary to use with attack jets are the Hydra rockets. May do the least damage, but they're not too affected by gravity and your reticle is similar to what you have for the GAU cannon. Can just do strafing runs for days and not worry about where you're going while using TV missiles/JDAMS/laser-guided missiles.

* In attack helis, Zunis do the most damage (and get mobility hits), but also are most affected by gravity. Hydras are least damage but again, mostly unaffected by it. It's your call on which rocket pod you want to run. And if you're good with TOW missiles, use them, but otherwise stick to heatseekers for a secondary.

* Stealth jet cannons are usually sufficient for killing aircraft. I prefer the 25 mm (mostly because of audio- I hate how the 20 mm sounds.) 30 mm may or may not be useful against heavy ground armor (thought they made it usable against armor in the latest patch but am not sure on it.) 30 mm also most affected by gravity, so if you run them, be sure to aim ahead of your target more. Also, if you want adaptability, use laser-guided missiles as your secondary. If you want dedicated AA abilities, use heatseekers until you get active radar or become skillful with passive radar.

* Scout heli builds depend on whether you go for specialization or jack-of-all-trades combat. You want to kill other aircraft best, I'd say use the minigun/heatseeker. Miniguns aren't as affected at long range and also don't have ammo caps (but an overheating limit.) If you want to focus more on infantry and armor, 25 mm/laser-guided missiles are best. Currently not sure where 25 mm versus miniguns stand in regards to which is better all around, since they've been patched several times, but I prefer using the miniguns due to accuracy at range against aircraft.

* For countermeasures, use ECM in helis when possible. Usually more reliable in them than flares. Also lasts longer. Jets and ECM is debatable. In my experience, it only deflects non-passive radar missiles about half the time, but the removal from radar and breaking of all other locks outweighs the benefits from not being as reliable in deflecting missiles.

* Until you learn to best control your vehicle after a mobility hit, use gyro stabilizers. Use other options once you figure out how to control it in a hit. I prefer belt feeders in jets and air radar in helis.

* Finally, learn to prioritize threats. In jets, your greatest threat will usually be the other jet. Kill the other jet first, and then go after other targets. In helis, it'll either be MAA, other aircraft, or engineers with Stingers/IGLAs. Go after the greatest threat in helis if you can, and fly away or use cover if you can't.",2,0,1444412243,1444716522
