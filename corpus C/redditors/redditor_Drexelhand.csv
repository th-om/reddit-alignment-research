The discovery institute published a list of ""scientists"" who reject evolution. Someone did [some impressive fact checking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty1Bo6GmPqM) on it that I recommend watching. The main points are that most ""scientists"" aren't even in a relevant field or really are scientists by any reasonable definition. ",8,0,1444496891,1444725695

cvuw0tm,1,t3_3o8ckj,Drexelhand,">  How can you take a position which consists of affirming firmly that ""god"" doesnt exist ?

some atheists do, though atheism is just a lack of belief in any god. those that take this further to assert that there isn't a god generally couch their assertion in probability. it is extremely unlikely there is a god to the point where it's likely an impossibility, given paradoxes associated with a god. 

> it looks to me the same kind of ""blind faith"" that religious persons exhibit .

faith in that context is about uncritically accepting something supernatural as true. faith isn't required to disbelieve that you're reading a message written by a swarm of spiders at a keyboard. am i a swarm of spiders at a keyboard? probably not, but the degree of certainty that i am not a swarm of spiders is derived from what you know of spiders, keyboards, and people.

in the absence of a god an assertion that there is no god is fairly reasonable, if not overstating what cannot be proven. ",3,0,1444495115,1444725695
