I am already pissed that I am being overcharged for drugs that are so old they were generic in the 90's, but are somehow under patent again.  The only thing I would be willing to pay more for is a better drug that I do not have to take as often, controls my symptoms better, and/or doesn't work through steroid pathways.",13,0,1444383081,1444728508
