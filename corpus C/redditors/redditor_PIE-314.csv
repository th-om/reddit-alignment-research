cvvawj6,0,t1_cvvaifz,PIE-314,">recious. Have you even seen a human or animal die? 

Yes, both.


Life is precious when we're connected to the loss. That is it. That's the reality of it. People die every day. Can you sympathize with others loss, sure but at the end of the day the people that matter are the ones you love. If you were to die right now, your family, probably your friends and maybe some coworkers will be effected but life goes on. You and I are both utterly insignificant. Deal with it.

>And for the record, you're a fucking idiot!

Your opinion has been noted and dismissed. For the record,  I've been called worse by better.",1,0,1444522659,1444716314
