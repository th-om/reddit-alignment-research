You can call me all the names you want to, but it is what it is. It's antiquated, it's BS, everybody likes to pay lip service to the idea of ""Oh modern independent women don't expect you to pay."" Yeah, sure, whatever, but when the check comes you better reach for it or you're going to get dinged several points on her mental date checklist.

Obviously four or five dates in it's going to be more equitable, but it's funny to me how people are just flatly denying reality ITT. I've worked in a few nice restaurants and they train us to give the check to the man. Yeah it's stupid and antiquated, benevolent sexism even, but I don't know a lot of women who care a lot about benevolent sexism except to make a point.",1,0,1444632208,1444719733

I mean, apples break down pretty quickly so it's not like you're throwing away plastic, and if you're that worried about it you can compost them. They're also super cheap, so it's not like having 30% more apples is going to help my budget a lot.",2,0,1444498611,1444719733

If you're not happy with your love life, change yourself or change your approach or be alone. Those really are your only options. You seem pretty confident about your looks and behaviors, so maybe you just need to put yourself out there more. Are you afraid of rejection?",2,0,1444418824,1444719733
cvtqo0s,1,t3_3o2386,thefloyd,"There's something about yourself you can improve, so focus on that instead of getting girls and it will come easier. I wish somebody had told me that when I was 19.

Messy hair? Get a trendy haircut. Ugly/ill-fitting clothes? Get new clothes. No money? Come up with it, step up your hustle game. Out of shape? Work out. Bored/boring? Find some damn hobbies.

Ask yourself, if I was a pretty girl with everything going for me, would I date me? Be honest. Then ask yourself why not and fix it.

Most of all, you have to actually flirt with women and ask them out. Be bold and forward without being creepy. It's a delicate balance.",2,0,1444402800,1444719733

cvsg1oz,1,t3_3nyc9v,thefloyd,"Yeah, if you're under 21 and not from here, don't expect to drink in bars. It's stupid but it's the law, and places can lose their liquor licenses for selling to underagers, so most of them don't. I'm 28 and I got ID'd at a dive bar last night.

When I was a bartender, one of my coworkers got fired when my boss ID'd somebody she didn't and they were underage. So, yeah, they tend to take that shit seriously. Of course, I've been drinking in bars since I was like 19, but bars where people know me. Nobody knows you.",1,0,1444311400,1444719733
