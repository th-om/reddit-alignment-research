cuv0gzv,1,t3_3k5ofx,lastnamesmith,"As the title suggests, I've recently received a Tsovet for my Birthday and I'm loving every minute with it. The sleek and simple design is amazing to look at and the clock itself runs flawlessly and almost silently. While I unfortunately do not know the exact model, it cost around $225 and was ready to use as soon as it was bought.

I have no complaints thus far. I like the fit on my wrist, I like the leather band, I find the color of the second hand and second marks appealing, and I enjoy wearing the Tsovet.",1,0,1441756060,1444729773
