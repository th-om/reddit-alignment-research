Find a couple of friends, or just a class and work from there. After your first month or so you will start realizing that despite it being hard to start, it will be much harder to stop. ",3,0,1444705060,1444727617
cvxqk1l,1,t3_3ojbj9,HollandGW215,"Just go to bodybuilding and buy the most popular. Test out a few and find out what works for you. Asking that question is like asking who is the best superhero. Everyone has an opinion and Batman is obviously the best one. 


Best time to drink whey protein is after you work out. Within 30 minutes or so you want about 25-35grams of protein depending on your weight. ",1,0,1444704956,1444727617
cvxq8tu,1,t3_3oixdl,HollandGW215,"Fucking 4000 calories a day? What the actual fuck. You would be losing a pound a day if that was true. Either that is wrong or your diet is horrible. 


I bike like 20 miles 3 times a week and that is about 600 calories. I could then work out after and still not reach 1500 active calories burned. 



Also working out for three hours doesn't equate to you being fit. A good hour workout is sufficient. Sounds like you are over training and doing something wrong with your diet. ",2,0,1444704454,1444727617

If I find any cool parties I'll shoot them your way. Meetup.com might be the move. 



The after party was crazy. But I felt out of place in my costume. Everyone was very gothic. ",2,0,1444614412,1444727617
