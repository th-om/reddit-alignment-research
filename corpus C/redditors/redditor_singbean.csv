I just want to chime in that as a pro-life woman, the idea that pro-life conservatives are operating a *war on women* is both baffling and infuriating.  It implies that only male conservatives are pro life, which I assure you is not the case.",1,1,1444700617,1444716486
cvxnfwq,0,t1_cvxloxn,singbean,"I've been playing WoW since the beginning, so yea I'll agree it's fun.

There are also a few really great MMO's now that you pay for the game, but there is no monthly fee - might be an option if paying for a monthly sub is too much ($15/mo).

The Secret World and Wildstar were both extremely fun.  I haven't played Trove but my friends are nuts over it.

Plus, Blizzard has a few new free to play games - Hearthstone, Heroes of the (something) and Overwatch.

Good luck op.",2,0,1444700076,1444716486

cvxky6j,1,t3_3ohhoy,singbean,"OP, maybe buy something with the money the two of you could share?

A console to play together, tickets to an event together - something he would enjoy.  He gets to give back some cash, you get to show him you care.

As for your kitty, you might look into getting him a marble slab - the use them for chinchillas to keep them cool.  You could use a chunk of marble tile or leftover marble counter peice from the hardware store.

Or, a spot with a small fan near a pet bed.",3,0,1444612059,1444716486
