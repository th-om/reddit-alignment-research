Nope. You are conflating [commuter students with off-campus students.](http://studentaffairs.unt.edu/off-campus-student-services#commuter) There are approximately 8,300 off-campus students. With ~21,000 of its total 38,000 students commuter students, you are in denial and/or easily influenced by the administration's PR drive to change the public perception of the university as part of its drive to be classified a Tier 1 university. 

BTW. another 3,000 are distance learning students, 100% of their classes are taken on the internet. Only 15% of students (~5,700) live in campus.",0,0,1444622240,1444719241
cvwkack,1,t3_3odabd,hardman52,"Yeah, you're right. If drinking was our problem, then just stopping drinking would solve everything. It wasn't and it didn't. in fact things got worse, because I had no other life skills other than drinking. From the time I first felt that magic of what alcohol could do, I never learned another thing. I didn't need to, anytime anything went right or wrong, I had alcohol, and it always worked, until it didn't.

I could go into a long story of what it was like, what happened, and what it is like now, but I'll skip all that and just say that today I have a good, satisfying life, and have had for a long time now. I have a family that I care about, I've had three good careers, and I've traveled all over the place. What made the difference for me is that I finally quit demanding that recovery be on my terms and I took the 12 steps as suggested by Alcoholic Anonymous. I have seen many people do the exact same thing I did, and with the same results. I have seen many more people refuse to experiment with their preconceived beliefs, and it did not work out so good for them, even though some of them stopped drinking.",2,0,1444620351,1444719241

UNT is a good school, but one does not hear anybody singling it out for anything other than its music, the same way that Baylor is noted for its law school.
