cvtqdzo,0,t1_cvtg5hk,sihtydaernacuoytihsy,"The house and senate passed slightly different versions, they were synthesized and amended in reconciliation, and the president signed the resulting bill passed by congress. Legal challenges have been nearly all failures. The most significant successful challenge was to the part of the bill that obligated states to expand their own medicaid programs: the federal government can't *compel* states to do stuff, even if the feds are paying, so the expansion was made optional. A far cry from a rewrite, though certainly unpleasant if you're poor and live in a state with a GOP governor.",1,0,1444402373,1444722907

cvsot33,0,t1_cvskfss,sihtydaernacuoytihsy,"Counterprediction: in 12 - 24 months, after enabling further humanitarian catastrophes, and after suffering significant (but undisclosed) casualties, Putin will pull his ""volunteer"" forces out of Syria, with the exception a small number of ""advisers"" in Damascus and Latakia. In this time, Russian forces will have inflicted significant damage to Jabhat Al-Nusra and the ""Army of Conquest"" and blown up a handful of Isis assets. As a result, the Syrian government will be slightly more secure, but Isis will still control the eastern desert and the Euphrates valley from the Iraqi border to the Turkish border (or very close to it). Russia's economy will continue to reel from low oil prices and EU sanctions. Russian citizens will believe the thousands of unmarked bodybags are a western media plot.

China and India will be unimpressed. The US will continue to be China's best frienemy. India will continue to keep its strategic options open--even as it continues to increase cooperation with the US.

Iran will continue to support Shi'a interests in Iraq and Syria, and will be the only functioning state willing to commit serious resources to defeating Raqqah. 

Just as Ukraine has largely been a loss for Russia, so too will Russia's half-assed power projection be, at best, a stalemate. The Assad regime simply lacks credibility in most of the Sunni belt--and adding Russian missile strikes to the barrel-bombing won't shock or awe anyone into capitulation. Instead, Isis and AQ will post pictures of civilian casualties, real and manufactured, and recruit bored teenagers from across the Islamic world. 

If anything, the economic ties between the EU, US, and China will ensure that international institutions persevere, despite Russian attempts to create alternatives.",5,0,1444324998,1444722907

cvsihk9,0,t1_cvrrbu4,sihtydaernacuoytihsy,"I'm not sure--[this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia%E2%80%93Russia_relations) suggests that, in the 1890's, Russian was interested in creating its own colonial or client states in the horn of Africa. I imagine that their motive was to act as a check on the British--control of the Horn would give Russia a base from which to split the British empire in two.
