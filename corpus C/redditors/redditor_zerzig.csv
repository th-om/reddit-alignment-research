Here's one I really like:
http://www.foodiecrush.com/201c3/10/slow-cooker-thai-chicken-soup/

Substitute 2lbs. extra firm tofu for chicken and vegetable broth for chicken broth. Cut tofu into 1/2 inch cubes. Don't use the fish sauce (for some reason it's made from fish). If you like kale, tear it into bite-size piece and add it with the peas for the last half hour. Kale adds some nice chewiness.",1,0,1444397520,1444728706

It's rather frustrating for guitaraholics and pedalaholics to try to reach orgasmic levels of reverie with low quality pictures of great setups and guitars.

cvhrnst,1,t3_3msgpe,zerzig,"1. The Gibson logo does not line up with the neck. It's tilted.
2. The truss rod cover is a poor imitation.
3. The frets appear to protrude over the binding instead of the binding being shaped to the end of each fret.
4. The headstock appears to made from one piece of wood instead of three.
5. The bridge height adjusters are slotted screws rather than knurled disks.
6. The cursive on ""Les Paul"" is wrong and too fat and sloppy.

And as you say, the body shape is wonky.

cv3zp8m,1,t3_3l5tvv,zerzig,"Alot of these posts say, ""Don't go to the South"" (to answer your question correctly, they should have said, ""Go to the South""). As someone who lives in the South, my response is, ""Avoid going to the South"" (as in, ""You should not avoid going to the South."")

The North, East, and West have great things about them and I've been to them all. I lived in CA for 3 years while going to graduate school after having been raised in the South.

We don't all have guns in our cars. We don't go barefoot all the time. We don't all have rebel flags. We don't all drive Ford trucks (with or without rebel flags in the back).

There will be a church on every corner, but there are agnostics, atheists, Buddhists, Muslims and so on and so on. I live in Nashville where there is the largest Kurdish population in the world outside of Kurdistan. There are also Latinos, Japanese (we have a Japanese consulate here which hosts a Japanese festival every year), Chinese, etc. There are universities that are comparable to the best universities in the world. There's much more music than just country and bluegrass (Hell, like it or not, Jack White lives here. The Black Keys live here. If you're lucky, you might get to see Jack fight the Black Keys.)

Any fuckin' kind of food you want. There's a Brit section in the grocery stores.

People will be nice to you. They'll love your accent. They'll probably tell you that our twangy southern accent comes from the Scots or Scot-Irish. You don't have to say, ""Yes ma'am"" and ""Yes sir.""

While in the US, do not listen to people who say, ""Don't go to the South."" That's bullshit.",12,0,1442439886,1444728706
