cvx6uy6,1,t3_3og2e3,Wylkus,"Relevant excerpt from Steven Pinker's Better Angels of Our Nature:

""There are unmistakable parallels between [male serial killers’] kind of violence—phallic-aggressive, penetrative, rapacious, and (insofar as it commonly gratifies itself upon the bodies of strangers) undiscriminating—and the typical pattern of male sexual behavior. For this reason, it is possible to see sadistic mutilation-murder as a grotesque distortion . . . of normal male sexuality.... Female psychopaths are no less depraved than their male counterparts. As a rule, however, brutal penetration is not what turns them on. Their excitement comes—not from violating the bodies of strangers with phallic objects—but from a grotesque, sadistic travesty of intimacy and love: from spooning poisoned medicine into the mouth of a trusting patient, for example, or smothering a sleeping child in its bed. In short, from tenderly turning a friend, family member, or dependent into a corpse—from nurturing them to death.""",12,0,1444674949,1444727448
cvx1x6g,0,t1_cvwylha,Wylkus,"I would argue that the tone mismatch is not inherent to the movie but rather between the simple story and the audiences expectations. By the time the majority of people went to go see it the movie was already known as one of the biggest box office hits of all time. That breeds unrealistic expectations and a subsequent backlash. People don't hate Avatar because it failed to achieve what it was trying to achieve, because it did. It was a pioneer in film making technology while telling a simple and engaging story, that's all James Cameron was trying to do. 

People hate Avatar because it failed to achieve what they felt it *should* be trying to achieve based on the insane profits it was making.",1,0,1444667685,1444727448
cvwvfyw,0,t1_cvwig5x,Wylkus,"As Roger Ebert pointed out about Titanic, the most expensive movie ever made is not the time to experiment with plot. With that much money at stake on the technology it's just too much risk to be taking chances with the narrative as well. Titanic and Avatar do not have appalling storytelling, they have simple, standard stories to tell and they do so very well. The [Plinkett review of Avatar](http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/other-movies/avatar/) goes more in depth into this.",9,0,1444656007,1444727448
