Is this wishful thinking, or do you have sources?

Sanders gets his social policy inspiration from Scandinavian countries, they pay for their programs with [high taxes on everybody](http://taxfoundation.org/blog/how-scandinavian-countries-pay-their-government-spending), not just the rich.",1,1,1444712561,1444720714
cvxugnx,1,t3_3oh768,Political_Throwawayz,"Since Sanders and his little Bernie-ites look to Scandinavia as their model for social programs, it is note worthy to consider how Scandinavian governments *pay* for their social programs. Yes, they have higher income tax rates for the 1%, but they also have *much* higher rates for the ""99%."" And their tax brackets are much lower than ours to boot.

They also use a VAT, and their corporate rates are lower than ours as well.

I would love to see Sanders try to sell the other half of his ""Scandinavian"" style spending plan.

Note: Obviously, each Scandinavian country has structured their tax system slightly differently, see the source for details.

>Welfare effects of minimum wage and other government policies
http://are.berkeley.edu/~perloff/PDF/mwwelfare.pdf

Thanks for link! I hadn't seen it before and quite enjoyed it, not least because it reaffirms my belief that minimum wage is bad policy and is detrimental to the economy, particularly to the poor. You see, this study does not conclude that wages for unskilled labor correlate negatively with social welfare programs, rather that minimum wage negatively correlates with *economic* welfare. HUGE difference.

Your confusion, I assume, is with the word ""welfare."" In academic economics welfare is not used to describe social programs like SNAP and medicaid. Economic welfare refers to societal prosperity. So when the authors write: 

>""The minimum wage, unlike most government transfer programs, lowered welfare in the 1980s and 1990s as measured by all commonly used welfare or inequality measures, including various Atkinson indexes, the Gini index, standard deviation of logarithms, and others"" 

what they mean is that minimum wage laws resulted in decreased societal prosperity, and contributed to societal inequality in particular. If you had read past the abstract this would have been made clear. From the conclusion:

>The minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and food stamps — unlike other government programs — increase inequality according to all common welfare measures (though the unemployment insurance and food stamps results are not statistically significant for a few welfare measures). A 10% increase in the minimum wage (about 50/c) increases the welfare loss from inequality by between $2 and $54 billion depending on the welfare index used.
So how can the government most easily raise welfare? The greatest gains in welfare for most welfare measures could be accomplished by a 10% reduction in the minimum wage.

Not exactly a ringing endorsement for the minimum wage.",1,1,1444706996,1444720714

Again, this claim is purely speculative and has not been born out in any of the economic literature I've come across. If you know of an academic study I've missed then please provide it. Otherwise, lay off the platitudes. ",0,0,1444696929,1444720714
