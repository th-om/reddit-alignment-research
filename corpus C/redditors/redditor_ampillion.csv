cvr9lr7,1,t3_3nua1t,ampillion,"Hey guys!

As someone who helps administrate for the MHI in both BB:Chaos Edition, and BB2, I'm kinda curious as to what is coming from the 'league options' mentioned in the patch notes? Will they include fixes to the administration rights? (Currently, only the president of a league can remove players or create competitions, despite the description of 'administrator' level powers saying otherwise.)

Something that's been bothering us is the current lack of many of the options we had in BB1, and trying to replicate those things (Such as the Cup style tournament) in BB2 is currently a massive headache. (Or, not possible due to the limit on active competitions within a league.) Will we at least get back some of those features from BB1? Will we get the ability to disable things such as the personal bank-to-TV or Stadium Improvements in private leagues? Any chance we can get pools that can handle odd numbers of participants? (IE, a fixed bye for one person every week, or a 6-man playoff where the #1 seeds get the bye for the first week, and play the winners of the first match.)

Thanks!",24,0,1444226965,1444718502
cvpkia1,0,t1_cvpijp7,ampillion,"Great. But here's the problem.
There is no political force doing that. There is no big group in Congress pushing for higher taxes on high earners (Because, let's be fair, that's who's going to get the better end of the deal on this particular trade treaty) to pay for the losers. Hell, there's more political force coming *down* on the losers already, in trying to cut back on welfare spending, than there is trying to fix the current issues. Let alone any more problems that will arise from this particular deal.

Again, if our government had the people's interest in mind, I would be less concerned. If we had some kind of progressive force in US government, we might be proactive about some of these things. That we have no 'answer' for our current problems, that are only going to get bigger once this goes into effect, is what troubles me.",3,0,1444092721,1444718502

Instead of, y'know, having the plan already in place to help them out, when we've clearly established there will be losers.

""What, people are going to suffer? Sure, we'll get to them."" That's gone so well in this country so far. We certainly haven't marginalized poor and minorities in this country for decades or anything.",3,0,1444089052,1444718502
cvgobxm,0,t1_cvg60fe,ampillion,"Then I read the transcript of the rest of that portion of town hall meeting.  The stuff not cut intentionally by this guy. He didn't go off his nut at all. Other people started stating 'Bullshit! Fuck Israel!'

He did use a terrible choice of words in telling someone to 'shut up'. He simply could of said 'Do you want me to answer the question or not? Because if you want to keep interjecting before I finish something, I can always move on'.

I mean the first comment below goes on to talk about how the rest of the discussion went. He said that he's got no magic solution to the issue and that he favored a two-state solution. He was flustered, sure. But he was trying to engage with someone that was essentially saying 'I want you to hate and condemn Israel and I'll not be satisfied with any other response.'",2,0,1443424659,1444718502
cvgm0ns,0,t1_cvg8rau,ampillion,"That's pretty much a lot, if not all, smaller/more focused subs on Reddit though.

Part of the issue I see, as someone who's subbed to it, is if I don't go rooting through the sub, you're not going to find anything that offers up a way to change it. Most of the stuff on the top of the sub is stuff only loosely connected to the UBI (mostly 'reasons why we need it.') 

While I can say I openly support a UBI, I'm always open to other ideas. I just don't ever see any other good alternative plans brought up. Perhaps because the concept itself is fairly simple, the only really difficult part is how to pay for it and how much, and an alternative plan would seem much more complex in comparison. So people hanging around haggling about the exact numbers constantly doesn't make a particularly interesting sub. ",3,0,1443417131,1444718502
cvglsgn,0,t1_cvgbg12,ampillion,"Here's the problem as I see it though: The low premium/high deductible plans are more than not the most likely plans that lead to people going into debt over health care. Those plans were not seen as being terribly inclusive as far as coverage goes, and what happens if you end up with some issues? What happens if your plan just doesn't cover testing at all, and now you need to have an MRI? A little blood in your stool isn't an emergency, but your doctor wants you to go for a colonoscopy?

Unless you're actively able to stash extra cash away for a rainy day on top of the cheapest insurance you could afford, any serious health care issue would end up wrecking you financially. Or perhaps a chronic issue might lead to you being unable to *perform your role at work, and now you're stuck looking for something you can manage while at the same time, having either new expenses (in the form of medication or treatments) while having less options (in the form of things that you can physically do.)

The people who are already making the low end of the monetary spectrum are less likely to be able to afford a plan that efficiently covers things that they might actually need if they ever start seeing a doctor. And not seeing a doctor potentially means someone could leave an untreated issue to become a chronic issue, to become a disability.

Besides. Catastrophic coverage would also likely have to be rather costly. Because you're effectively trying to cover for every serious side-effect of another issue, be it a car accident or an injury at work. Chronic or underlying issues may plague someone's life for the rest of their years from beyond that point, and the minute someone 'cashes out' that big policy to care for it, the costs are going to be transferred to everyone else paying into that plan. Unless, it just doesn't cover all that much... which in that case, why would I want it at all?

Eventually, you're going to have to decide: Are we going to start denying people the ability to get treatment even if they can't afford it, but want it? Are we then going to acknowledge that a majority of Americans cannot afford it right now?

Because I would assume that most logical people would buy insurance if they could afford it, if it covered things, and they could still afford normal expenses. I also assume that the median wage in this country isn't enough to manage that.",1,0,1443416529,1444718502

I had this sort of situation happen to me once before, and ended up resting it off. It was bizarre at the time, but I think a lot of it turned out to be stress related. I would certainly check if you've got a fever though, just to see if there isn't something food poisoning related.",1,0,1442962367,1444718502

Are you paying for people to move to other countries? Actually legally moving to another nation and becoming a citizen of another country isn't an easy task. Hell, moving around from state to state can be rough if you don't have a comfortable cushion of cash to support a change of location. 

You're essentially stating 'I'm going to take some of your freedoms away because of my personal brand of morality. If you don't like it, tough shit, hope you've got the cash and position to move to a better country!' Congratulations, you've now created oppression of the poor.
