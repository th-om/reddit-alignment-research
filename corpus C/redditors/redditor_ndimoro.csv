That figure is also not counting all of the savings America would enjoy with the move to single-payer healthcare and the increased economic activity that his massive trillion dollar New Deal-esque infrastructure bill would spur.",1,1,1444717621,1444718490
cvxwa63,0,t1_cvxr5jg,ndimoro,"There is an illusion of control because of the flood of money in politics. Also, the House is actually moving to the left if the Republicans can't come to a consensus on the new Speaker. There are always ebbs and flows to government and political opinions.",1,1,1444717550,1444718490

cvxo77d,1,t3_3oiino,ndimoro,Watch Chris Matthews slink away when confronted on his lies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k8x7QOBhFg (not related to Bernie but really shows what kind of person he is.),3,0,1444701237,1444718490
cvwozh5,0,t1_cvwooz7,ndimoro,"Yup. I've been following Sanders for years, even encouraged him to run long before he even began publicly floating the idea. If we're ever going to have a progressive wave in American politics then *we* are the ones who need to be on the frontlines supporting those who have the integrity to speak out on behalf of us. I wish I had the money to contribute to all of the progressives, Raul, Grayson, Ellison, etc. the list goes on. Sending words of support and urging others to do the same is the best we can do in most cases. But that will help.",19,0,1444631835,1444718490

Regardless, Gabbard was ""spoken to"" regarding her call for more debates, and no matter what they said they should be held accountable for this undemocratic display.",6,0,1444631695,1444718490
cvwoo79,0,t1_cvwo6fs,ndimoro,And imagine the backlash for someone like Tulsi if she misrepresented what DNC staff told her? They are walking it back as fast as they can because they see the potential for this to blow up in their face on the eve of the first debate.,6,0,1444630845,1444718490
