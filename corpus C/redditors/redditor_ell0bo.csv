cvwtyne,0,t1_cvwn78w,ell0bo,"A few times they actually handed off to Murry when starting out from under center, not just from the shot gun, allowing him to run more N/S than E/W.  When he goes E/W we are screwed, he can't just plant a foot and turn down hill, needs to start that way.

It also looked like we made more of an attempt to get our TEs involved in the short passing game.  That will help to open things up as well in the future if teams actually have to respect them as viable options.",2,0,1444651896,1444731684

I'm not sure if he's the best judge of talent, and his hubris wouldn't allow him to change his game plan to adapt to the abilities of his current players.  Luckily, one of those things appears to have changes this week.",6,0,1444622050,1444731684

I'll time my drive so I can listen to it on the radio while I drive.  Eagles playing amazing, I might be back in Philly by 1pm so I can watch it in peace.

Today I listened to the first half on the radio, second half sitting on my couch.  It's a matter of effort I'm willing to put in to watch the team. ",-1,0,1444601022,1444731684
cvw9asw,0,t1_cvv2cjr,ell0bo,"Specific framework questions I hate... if anything, I'll ask for a code sample.  I can barely remember half the time if it's shift or unshift that pushes an object onto the front of an array, why would I expect someone to answer off the top of their head some question about some framework's API.

Now, for something like angular, if you say you know it, I'd expect you to be able to explain the digest cycle and the difference between $apply and $digest.

I'd prolly also ask something about application composition to make sure the person understands MVC and separation of concerns.",2,0,1444600628,1444731684

The offense is shaky at best, and definitely not going to win a Superbowl, not even close to that caliber.

I don't want us to pack it up, but to say we would be happy barely getting by while a buzz saw is just out there waiting for us... I'm not sure about that.  If anything I think people on here are unusually optimistic.",2,0,1444143537,1444731684

I hope so much I'm wrong, I pray they really just need time to gel, and come out swinging next week.  I, however, don't have that much faith in Chip's ability to pick good players.

I'll watch all the games, but I certainly won't be spending money to watch this.",4,0,1444142238,1444731684
