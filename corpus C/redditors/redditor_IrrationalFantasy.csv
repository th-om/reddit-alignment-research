cvv2soi,0,t1_cvuy397,IrrationalFantasy,The same charge could be levelled at you. I encourage detailed arguments instead of ad hominem attacks.,3,0,1444507548,1444726800
cvv2om0,0,t1_cvv03nq,IrrationalFantasy,"Sadly, they don't realize it's a contradiction. They will tell you how they would get their goods from a communist or socialist country if they could, though in reality it would all be much more expensive.",1,0,1444507340,1444726800
cvug35l,0,t1_cvu7ssu,IrrationalFantasy,"Tbh, a ground landing would be just as cool, maybe more so. The whole ""landing"" thing is what really matters.",3,0,1444445312,1444726800
cvtbqdu,0,t1_cvry1bu,IrrationalFantasy,"Correct. So what do we do? How do we treat Iran and the deal there, in this context? I believe the deal was essential because other countries would remove sanctions anyway, but clearly an event like this warrants a response.",1,0,1444361081,1444726800
cvpexxc,1,t3_3nkz7f,IrrationalFantasy,"I have a technical question: a lot of these provisions talk about making governing bodies or watchdogs ""independent"". That's fine when it comes to watchdogs, but when it comes to bodies like Statscan, how will they make sure that the bodies are acting efficiently? There is also a lot of stuff in this document about making government more efficient, effective and accountable, and I'm wondering how that works together.",2,0,1444083011,1444726800
cvpdx2t,0,t1_cvozy5a,IrrationalFantasy,"It doesn't look like there's anything about seed banks in the agriculture policy. That's a shame, it would be a forward-thinking move on an important issue, and important way to deal with crop loss from climate change.

cvpdpdc,0,t1_cvp0vpp,IrrationalFantasy,"Trudeau is a comitted naturalist and has done a lot of major work with Katimavik and related programs, so it makes sense that their parks programs would be detailed and robust. He used to be the Liberal critic for Youth and Amateur Sport, too.",8,0,1444080992,1444726800
cvpddp1,1,t3_3nk3qp,IrrationalFantasy,"I'm a little concerned that Nanos is largely the only polling firm showing a big Liberal surge. Andrew Coyne [posted a graphic](https://twitter.com/acoyne/status/651090413294501888) of the polling data for this race with and without Nanos in the average, and the difference is striking.

What do we make of this? Should we put a lot of stock in these results? And will it be enough? CBC's Polltracker [still puts the Conservatives ahead](http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/poll-tracker/2015/index.html) in the overall seat count.",1,0,1444080472,1444726800
cvp14t2,0,t1_cvovo4g,IrrationalFantasy,Interesting. But then why are the Yakuza so much more open in Japan than criminal organizations in other countries? They seem to have some degree of political and social tolerance.,4,0,1444062197,1444726800
cvp0goa,1,t3_3nk32z,IrrationalFantasy,"When Lynton Crosby went to work in Britain on their recent election, the polls consistently underrepresented the success of the Tories there, who went on to win an unexpected majority of seats.

Do you think a similar thing could happen with the election here in Canada? And what causes the ""shy conservative"" effect? I've thought it might have something to do with people privately agreeing with unpopular stances on immigration or austerity, but that's just speculation.",1,0,1444061082,1444726800
