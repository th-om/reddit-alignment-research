That was one of the most matter of fact, coldly objective articles I've read regarding Israel and Palestine. It clearly states the kid was stabbing police, it talks about Obama condemning the attacks, and it talks about other Israelis and Palestinians engaging in violence.  What article did you read?

So often, I hear about cops going above and beyond, taking risks to help people. Oh wait, actually they only do that to catch drug dealers they can make lots of money from.

This isn't about any individual cop. This is about the systemic problems that make every single cop a potential danger to my life. Plenty of cops are very nice. But if/when (obviously different situations call for different dispositions) they are, they're missing an attribute that happens to be heavily reinforced by their position.

cvurxy9,0,t1_cvurfx8,tacoman359,"Well, black people don't have a union that protects them from any harm, they are charged with and suspected of crime at much higher rates than anyone else (this is controlling for differences in actual crime committed), and most of the violence is gang related which makes it somewhat reasonable to avoid. 

So, no, they're pretty different. Cops never have to worry about doing the wrong thing because they almost never get charged, and that's scary. ",6,0,1444486548,1444721990
