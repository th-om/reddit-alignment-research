cvrohki,0,t1_cvro37k,ZZ9ZA,"Heh, I want something LIGHT.

A chambered Vader 8 is lighter than almost all production 6s...",2,0,1444249073,1444730550
cvrnsak,0,t1_cvrlfi8,ZZ9ZA,"Doesn't really bother me. At least on mine there's just enough of a radius to the edge that it isn't really annoying. 

That said, I'm saving up for a Kiesel Vader ;)",2,0,1444248057,1444730550
cvrjkdd,1,t3_3nv762,ZZ9ZA,"What do you see as the future of ""mid-range"" guitars?

The low-end has gotten way better thanks to ubiquitous CNS, and the high-end has gotten....more expensive. What about in the middle, say the $1500ish price range?

From what I see the Made in Korea instruments are really hitting it out of the park right now...e.g. Reverend and the neck-thru Schecters.

Also: How big of a deal do you see extended-range guitars being going into the future? 7s seem practically mainstream, and 8s and 9s are coming onto the market.",9,0,1444241978,1444730550
cvrho1b,0,t1_cvrh4eh,ZZ9ZA,"It's not a Gibson. It's still a thinner-than-average neck, generally speaking. Just not to the extreme of an Ibanez.",1,0,1444239243,1444730550
cvrgmgx,1,t3_3nuklg,ZZ9ZA,"Another one to keep an eye out for is the Schecter Omen 8. Great build qaulity, decent-to-good hardware, and about the same money as the Ibby. Neck profile will be a little thicker which many prefer over the super thin Ibanez. I picked up one for $250 very lightly used and it's been a great starter 8.",1,0,1444237753,1444730550
cvqucxu,0,t1_cvqjocc,ZZ9ZA,"Umm, no. Multiplication in a CPU is nothing like that. CPUs have dedicated multiplication instructions.

Multiplication IS more expensive, but not NEARLY as much as you're making it out to be.",3,0,1444183857,1444730550
