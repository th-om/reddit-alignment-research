I don't really find Rick and Morty particularly more politically or socially edgy than any other show.  They don't take on celebrities or politicians or social norms.  Having fart jokes is not the same as being irreverent.

But perhaps I have a poor memory.  When is Rick and Morty irreverant?",-1,0,1444689444,1444719038

cvw79ip,0,t1_cvw4n4f,sje46,"He could say that deniers of global warming shouldn't be President of the united states.

Literally nothing about what he said indicates that a test should be implemented, and therefore, it isn't unconstitutional.  So there is no reason to bring up an Article of the Constitution here, because what he's saying is ""A person who I disagree with on important matters shouldn't be president"", something that *everyone* agrees with, and is the entire *point* of democracy.

The most problematic part of his comment is saying that you can't be a Muslim in good standing if you don't believe in Sharia law, and whether that is true or not depends on your interpretation of the Quran and the rest of Muslim tradition, and I'm not qualified to speak on that, but I am a bit of an antitheist, so I'm not particularly disinclined to say it's not possible.  However, he didn't say no Muslim should be president of the United States--he said no Muslim who believes in Sharia law should be.  So in other words, he presumably would have no problem with a non-fundamentalist Muslim in office--say, someone of Turkish ancestry (the Turks, traditionally, are religious but very secular).  This is really an important difference.

But the simplest reading of his comment is indeed simple: ""I don't want a president who implements Sharia law"", something I'm sure 99% of the people here agree with.  Something I'm sure you agree with.  The only really disagreeable thing here is his ""No True Scotsman"" implication that real Muslims believe in Sharia Law.  Which is douchey indeed.

>But even if I accept your argument: why would you want a man who doesn't believe in the ideals behind the Constitution to be President?

But...what?  I didn't say that.  I don't want Ben Carson to be president; I think he's an idiot.  But he's not saying he doesn't believe in the ideals behind the Constitution.  In fact, he's saying that someone who wants to implement something unconstitutional (Sharia law), shouldn't be President.  Which is...pretty straightforward.

I hope I'm making myself clear.  Bluntly, I think he should be more focused on overly religious *Christians* in office, because I do not think the US is in any fear of becoming an Islamic state.  We are in fear of becoming a Christian state, though.",3,0,1444597305,1444719038
