cvxudvd,0,t1_cvwziyv,genebeam,"The story of Avatar is more atrocious than its unoriginality. Not only are the major story and action beats taken from the *Dances with Wolves* genre-cliche, but the Native American veneer is transplanted undisturbed onto what's supposed to be an alien planet. The primary purpose of the film -- depiction a wholly original world we've never seen on screen before -- is undermined by our pre-existing familiarity of the Na'vi culture and its tropes. It's like remaking Amadeus but replacing Mozart with an artist no one respects as a talent. 

Watching Avatar I kept waiting for *something* that'd break the cliche but Cameron just burrowed further into it at every possible decision of the production: the setting, the look of the Na'vi, the accents of the Na'vi, the portrayals of the Na'vi, the lifestyle of the Na'vi, the spirituality and philosophy of the Na'vi, the tools and weapons of the Na'vi, the wildlife, the nature of the conflict between the humans and Na'vi. It was so predictable that *South Park* called it out as ""Dances with Smurfs"" way too accurately upon the release of a plotless preview of the film.",2,0,1444712175,1444717408

The factor that converts 10^10^2 to 10^10^100 is much closer to 10^10^100 than it is to 10^(10^98).

You could say: the number of atoms required to reach a distance of 10^10^100 meters when strung out separated by a light-year is basically the current number of atoms in the universe raised to the power of 10^(98).",4,0,1444610687,1444717408

Your post is fascinating and it makes me wonder: what makes this particular beer-muscles-guns masculinity coherent in practice (i.e., how do we know people who say ""men should drink beer"" are correlated with people who say ""men should have guns""). And how do we know this masculinity is ""dominant""? Anecdotally I don't see this masculinity as a coherent pressure in practice, and the culture as a whole seems to disparage beer/muscles/guns mentalities.

cvwcpe9,0,t1_cvwbo6x,genebeam,"> His post is about what gun control advocates term as ""assault weapons"" which is a very vague, arbitrary term.

It's partly about that, but OP is also saying these measures won't do anything to curb mass shootings and that deaths thereof are negligible. That's the view my argument was targeting.

> In the U.S., we have more killings with blunt objects than we do rifles. It would make more sense to pass legislation banning blunt objects than it would to ban ""assault weapons"".

No it wouldn't make more sense to ban ""blunt objects"". I feel silly for pointing this out but this kind of argument is weirdly persistent: any consideration of a ban on category of objects X ought to weigh the costs against the benefits. A huge portion of our lives crucially depend on ""blunt objects"", banning them would be extraordinarily, unfathomably disruptive to our standards of living and cause far more damage, in human lives and otherwise, than they currently do as murder weapons. Guns, being a much, much, much narrower category of objects, wouldn't be nearly so disruptive to ban.

Please stop using this argument, whether it's for ""blunt objects"", knives, cars, swimming pools, etc. It doesn't pass the cost/benefit analysis sniff test.",3,0,1444606512,1444717408

Most ""stars"" have a limited range. Tom Cruise couldn't pull off playing someone like Dan Mahowny; there's a cocky bravado that emanates from Cruise in every role, sometimes inappropriately. It would be completely incompatible with a characterization of Dan Mahowny. It's not type-casting, it's a central thrust of their style of performance. Hoffman had no such hindrances. You can't find a pattern in his performances. The only other actors I'd consider putting on that tier are Gary Oldman, Meryl Streep, Daniel Day Lewis.",1,0,1444604315,1444717408
