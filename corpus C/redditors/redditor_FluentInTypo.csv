cvx0obu,0,t1_cvwyqjc,FluentInTypo,"I hate Dell for one reason - network drivers. Why the fuck cant I get any of there machines online when using anything other than an OEM disk? Why do they have to make their  etwork driver so damn special, that I have to get it from their site. What the hell is in that binary? These days, not being able to look at that source distrubs me.

cvwif1n,0,t1_cvw3r3z,FluentInTypo,Oh absolutely. They said within weeks of the revelations thatall encdypted data is stored becuase all encrypted data is suspicious. I just want to discourage people from thinking that overseas services are somehow safer - its worse overseas becuase they dont have to follow *any* rules over there. ,1,0,1444616997,1444729218
cvwical,0,t1_cvwauos,FluentInTypo,"Based on what? Their slides that says they cant deanonimize users? Given that they freely admit to being able to break vpn, possibly ssh and habe back doors in some SSL, I highly doubt that they would fake one slide saying that Tor remained nearly impossible to break.

cvw47qn,0,t1_cvw2qrf,FluentInTypo,"Gnusocial and protonmail. Or that tututanua mail (forget its spelling) or riseup.net if your into politics. There are a ton of services that are 'free as in freedom' out there. 

Watch ""terms and conditions apply"" on netflix. You'll see just how much of your life you've given over already. You'll also learn that when you ""delete"" that embarassing post you made, or changed your mind about sharing it....facebook doesnt really delete it - they just hide it from you. It still lives in there servers and is only flagged as ""dont show this to the user anymore, but we can still sell it"". Ok, it doesnt really say all that, but it indeed, is never really deleted and is only hidden *from you*.  If the post was interesting to a databroker, you bet your ass they will sell it. 

If you want a facebook experience of this life your living, by all means, keep using it. I just really dislike the whole site an concept. ",3,0,1444592754,1444729218
cvw18j8,0,t1_cvvtzue,FluentInTypo,"It has nothing to do with paranoia. I dont think anyone should make money off my private life is all. Why should google make billions of dolars a year by knowing the intimate details of my life? Or yours? Youre not making the money off your data - they are. Fuck that. If you really dont care about being spied on, get rid of your ad-blockers and allow all the third party tracking. You've got nothing to hide, right? It will make advertisements more relevent the more you share, right? All the arguments you use to exonorate Goog and FB can be aplied to all other advertising companies. ",2,0,1444588248,1444729218
cvw11n4,0,t1_cvvtm1b,FluentInTypo,"Of course, which is why I dont recommend vpn services or email services from Overseas providers to any American. At least here we have a semblance of protection. As soon as we choose PIA as a VPN provider, or protonmail as an email provider, all bets are off and NSA gets a full take on our data since we appear to be foreign - and foreign is the exact class of people that NSA is tasked with collecting, no holds barred.",1,0,1444587950,1444729218
cvw0dm6,0,t1_cvvyzbd,FluentInTypo,"Well now your flip flopping, first saying that  ""you do have control"" and now saying that ""we never had control"". But I get your meaning. I admire people who honestly live by a ""free as in freedom"" code and can make a meaningful life for them outside of all the convenience. I cant take it that far for myself, but I have certainly given up many conveniences in order to be in control of my own life and not allow 'the big 3' make money off me. I cant give up online shopping though, so I am thougroughly owned by the 4th. I dont fb, gmail or apple anything on my own. I try not to share data with my data-stupid friends. I hobbled my phone to not be ratting me out *as much*, but thats the nature of cell phone. If we ever get true open hardware in anything - phone, desktop, chips etc I will be very happy. 

In RMS eyes, I am a compromised human being. In my eyes, I do what I can while minimizing my footprint of the things I am compromised by.",1,0,1444586927,1444729218
