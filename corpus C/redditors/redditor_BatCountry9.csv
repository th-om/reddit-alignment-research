cvxvnpo,0,t1_cvxu3yk,BatCountry9,"Maybe the ""take our country back"" rhetoric, but no recent president has come close to receiving all the accusations of being ""foreign"" in every way Obama has. Democrats get called communists, republicans get called fascists, and both get called dictators if they flex their executive muscles. That's par for the course and to be expected. There's a whole new level of vitriol that's been directed at Obama because of his unique background. He's got the funny name, he's black, family in Kenya, exposed to different religions and cultures all over the world...just one of those things is enough to make an ignorant yokel hate you, but add them all up and some people start to think he's the most unamerican person ever. And it goes far beyond comparing him to Hitler or Stalin as is normal with Presidents. ",1,1,1444715612,1444716950
cvxpxkz,0,t1_cvxp6yr,BatCountry9,"""Republicans are racist"" is obviously a sweeping generalization. But we have to look at the fact that racism, in particular anti-black sentiment, still exists. It's no longer as obvious and no longer codified in law, but I think we can all agree we still have some racial tensions in America and these racist attitudes are more prevalent in the South. If we were talking 60 years ago, we'd be talking about how racist southern democrats are, but because we're talking about racism today, particularly in the South, we have to talk about it existing in the Republican Party. Nowadays, if someone is white, lives in the South and is racist, odds are they're a Republican. Again, this is a geographic thing. A republican from New York or Vermont won't necessarily have the same social attitudes as their southern party members. ",1,1,1444703944,1444716950
cvxoqhl,0,t1_cvxghoe,BatCountry9,"You seem to be preoccupied with party labels when the underlying political ideology is more important. The same Deep South social conservatives who used to be Democrats are now the Deep South socially conservative Republicans. Also worth noting is the CRA was passed due to overwhelming Northern support. Bipartisan support. The opposition was largely southern democrats and a couple republicans. So it's not like both parties completely flipped 180Â° ideologically, it's a regional thing. Both Dems and Reps in the north were more socially progressive, while their southern counterparts were not. So to say a blanket statement like ""the parties switched"" is an oversimplification, but to deny any sort of party migration by southern social conservatives is sticking your head in the sand.

cvwsbkx,1,t3_3od47b,BatCountry9,"I hear this type of thing a lot. ""The liberals hate him so he must be doing something right! They're scared of him!"" They wear this criticism like a badge of honour. I've heard this logic applied to Ted Cruz and Scott Walker a lot. ""Liberals are scared of Cruz because he defends the Constitution!"" Look, sometimes there are firebrands and iconoclasts who upset the status quo and push for real change and people respond negatively and cast all sorts of aspersions because they're afraid of change....but sometimes you're just an asshole. Ted Cruz isn't a bold reformer going against the ""Washington Cartel"" to make the United States a better place, he's just an asshole. Ben Carson isn't a jerk, but he certainly doesn't have the opposition shaking in their boots. Anyone who can view the situation objectively knows that he's enjoying his Bachmann-esque popularity surge right now, but he'll eventually fizzle out because he doesn't know anything about basic government functions or foreign policy. I don't dismiss Carson as a candidate because I'm scared of him. I dismiss him because he's a bozo. ",5,0,1444645585,1444716950
cvwrd1j,0,t1_cvwk2rw,BatCountry9,"It's a cultural meme. A virus. Fucked up 20 year olds used to just hang themselves in their room, but now they've decided to chase the high score and take as many people out with them as possible. It's a game. If a kid is suicidal and wants to be famous, mass murder is the quickest way to achieve those goals. We're certainly not going to put an end to these sprees by continuing to report on them 24 hours a day",2,0,1444641188,1444716950

cvwr4z1,1,t3_3offpl,BatCountry9,"Ted Cruz is the worst person in America. It blows my mind that people are willing to throw and support and money behind him just because he hates liberals and Obama and says some ra ra bullshit about the Constitution. We get it, you like the Constitution. This is the same guy who floated the idea of SCOTUS retention elections after a couple cases he didn't agree with. He uses his Mr. Constitution shtick the same way Jim Jones used the Bible. Painting himself as a 21st century founding father, he's duped millions of people into thinking he cares about anything but becoming the most powerful man on earth. I don't know if people are caught up in his rhetoric, blinded by their hatred for Obama or just poor judges of character, but they're willing to support a diagnosable sociopath who doesn't give a shit about them. Ted Cruz is a cult leader in Senator's clothes. Truly a wretched individual. ",4,0,1444640186,1444716950
