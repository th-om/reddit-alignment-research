Here's where nuance and an effort not to stir shit comes in because there's definitely a blurry area between ""success over common good"" and ""healthy competition"", which I'd consider a positive trait of masculinity. It's really easy to conflate the two if you're looking to push an agenda.",1,1,1444714076,1444723612
cvxsv8a,0,t1_cvxs4se,12broombroom,"Toxic masculinity gets misused *a lot* but there are some good examples of it not being used as an insult. A person (man or woman) making fun of a guy for crying is one, same for shaming dudes with tiny schlongs, or accusing a guy of having a tiny schlong, same deal with virgin shaming for men.",21,0,1444708942,1444723612

cvuygv9,1,t3_3o8lgm,12broombroom,"But what would an Assault Weapons ban actually do? You ban AR-15s and people will buy Mini-14s or some other intermediate caliber semi-auto rifle. Same goes for shotguns, bolt actions, handguns, etc. What a tool was designed to do doesn't really matter compared to what it can do. For every Assault Weapon that fits your definition, there's a non-Assault Weapon that'll do the same thing just as well.

Do you believe that people simply won't buy a gun if the specific model they wanted isn't legal? I think it's a lot more likely they'll just buy the next closest thing that's just as deadly. How are you addressing the gun violence issue at all then if you're just limiting the variety (but not the lethality) of firearms available? ",13,0,1444499546,1444723612
