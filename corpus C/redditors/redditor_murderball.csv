If saving him for potentially one plate appearance later in the game were so much more beneficial, then teams wouldn't start their best players but rather save them as pinch hitters.",1,0,1444696655,1444728864
cvx9vh7,0,t1_cvx9ibp,murderball,"sure, and I'm not trying to rile up Colts fans.  I've enjoyed watching their team since Peyton's first start.  But the Colts have a lot of holes on defense facing a Patriots offense that has mastered the short routes for long drives, and the Colts offensive line has been a huge problem this season and they are facing a Patriots coach who feeds on smart, aggressive quarterbacks.",4,0,1444679289,1444728864

cvx908m,0,t1_cvx8hr6,murderball,"Bradshaw/Jacobs/Ward were a great trio when our line was kicking ass through 2008 or 2009.  But when the line got old as a unit, and Bradshaw battled injuries, and Jacobs wore out, it was a dreadful phase of our game.  I wasn't blaming the RBs so much as the run game itself-- mostly attributable to non-existant run-blocking.

But more importantly, none of those guys were great receiving threats out of the backfield, which was a bigger part of my larger point about this season's improvements.",1,0,1444678060,1444728864
cvx8vxx,1,t3_3ogwu8,murderball,"As a huge Luck fan, I don't think this will be pretty.  I hope that I""m wrong.  After not playing for two straight games, he now has to come back to play a hot team with a vendetta for deflate-gate and one of the greatest football mind/coaches in the game's history.   I'd take the Patriots no matter what the line is.",13,0,1444677883,1444728864
cvx8h9a,0,t1_cvx7jnx,murderball,"Eli spent the majority of his career in a high-risk passing offense that suppresses completion percentage.  Passer rating double counts completion percentage and a lot of QBs have upped their completion percentages by having great safety net options-- notably tight ends and running backs out of the backfield.    Eli seemingly had a different tight end every season, and with Wilson's congenital stenosis ending his career before it took off, Eli went from Tiki's retirement in 2006 to 2015 without having a bona fide receiving threat out of the backfield.",1,0,1444677293,1444728864
cvx87pk,1,t3_3ogotm,murderball,"Great post. I often make a very similar argument. It's important to note that Gilbride's system has fantastic potential and the Giants have utilized it tremendously at times ( first half vs. Tampa in 2011).  But it was a bad fit for a depleted roster.

It wasn't only the dearth at WR and atrocious O-line, it was the non-existant running game and the carousel at tight end every season.  Shockey, to Boss, to Ballard, to Beckum, to Bennett, to Myers, to Donnell.

In today's NFL, QBs rely on the safety nets that tight ends and running backs out of the backfield provide, and this is the first season since Tiki that the Giants have had a proven receiving running back.

Makign matters worse, our defense and special teams were also abysmal and so the Giant offense would always be in a deep hole forcing Eli to be even more aggressive with unproven, inconsistent receivers that have to not only make the same reads as Eli, but because of the long distance to go each down, and bad O-line, Eli would have to get rid of the ball with less information that any QB would like.",3,0,1444676910,1444728864
