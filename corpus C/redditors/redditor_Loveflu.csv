cvvq5mp,0,t1_cvvgsmn,Loveflu,"> Elements of the science are pretty much settled, but that doesn't mean we've learned all there is to know about it. We know, for instance, that man-made global warming is almost certain to be happening, just like we know that evolution is almost certain to be occurring.

False equivalency. See my first statement - ""All science disciplines are not equal"".  That meant to tackle the dogmatic, juvenile understanding of science that reddit is known for.

The evidence for evolution is strong and evidence is built across many different disciplines each independent of each other.

Climate change models have *assumptions* built into layers upon layers of *predictions*.  

You aren't doing science any favors by not understand it and the differences between complex and simple problems. 

The results have different levels of certainty.

Climate change suffers from a plethora of uncertainty, partly because the science was abandoned a long time ago and it is now almost purely a political movement.",-4,0,1444564531,1444726440

I mean, this isn't the first time we've had grave predictions even in the past 50 years. 

But do tell. As it stands now, if you buy into the latest alarmist position, we are heading towards 3 degree increase in worldwide temperature and even the most drastic cuts that are proposed by the G8 make no change at all.

So what is it? What do we do? Take into account plunging the world into a mass depression and all the starvation and pollution that that occurs when people live in third world countries.",-2,0,1444522913,1444726440

Science disciplines that use complicated models with a layers upon layers of assumptions is not pure science.

Science can be interpreted differently and hypotheses gleaned from only a small amount of data in a controlled experiment.

Yet, the ""science"" is settled on climate change?

Sorry, political infiltration, poor data, poor models and convenient ""discoveries"" do not make good science.

History will show that climate alarmism has done far worse for the institution of modern science than any other issue.",-5,0,1444522752,1444726440
