So then *why* guns for everybody? Guns are not chimney decorations, they are made to kill. Every bought gun will by high chance kill a person or more. Carson just made a good example of the twisted view on firearms by pro-gun people: As if the Jews could have prevented their annihilation in Nazi Germany if they had firearms. Only the most ignorant person on earth could say that. But then again, I am speaking about Carson.

OVERALL crime rates dropped which they did in all western countries. But no other ""advanced"" civilised country on earth has such a huge mass shootings problem.",1,0,1444520009,1444730322
cvv48qy,0,t1_cvru18g,thmonline,"Democrats look at other countries and it is a fact that the US fails in both violence and social security. Eat or get eaten. This is not what civilisation was about. One cannot be productive, inspiring and innovative when one has to constantly focus on not being shot and not die of hunger. The NRA started off as an empowerment for the people but due to radicalisation and the removal of a lot of existing firearm laws it became the pus of the Republican Party. And quite frankly I believe this party is dead. And a few moderate Republicans begin to see that now in the light of the failures that try to be Republican nominee for US-President or Speaker.

cvrsv0s,0,t1_cvqquda,thmonline,"> I agree. However it appears the Democrat party prioritizes pissing away political capital on gun control fights than say addressing those issues.

Isn't it the Republican Party that discards social benefits from low income families? All I hear from Dems is to improve social welfare, create jobs and maybe a small restriction of firearms for people with a violent crime record. In my opinion that seems more fair than cutting taxes for the rich, denying the importance of a social state and loosening firearm ownership rights and responding to homicides with ""more guns"".

If you have a reasonable home, get paid a fair wage or there is a good provision of work system as well as a solid social services system if you fall out of the grid, that should prevent most of the violent crime that is ""living situation""-related, no? What I am saying is: The system is upside down: You can't remove any kind of social sphere form the society and leave people behind AND give them guns (resp. make them available to them). What you gotta do is – especially if you refuse any additional gun restriction – improve the systematic in which people don't feel like getting hands on a gun and starting a criminal career is the only way of receiving money/food/housing/security/responsibility/respect.",1,0,1444170010,1444730322

cvq2nny,0,t1_cvpp0rl,thmonline,"Okay, you are right. But that made me wonder about the background issues here: Why are robbers and burglars such a huge threat in the US? In Germany nobody even fells like having to own a gun because any day somebody could just break into your house. It's not that doesn't happen but the overall rate is much lower than in the US and for the most part it's robberies of empty houses and completely firearm-free. And that's a mixture of three things: As soon as there are firearms in a trial, prison sentence shoots up the hill plus firearms are heavily prohibited plus the social welfare in Germany is well enough that crime ""out of necessity"" is basically just not happening, it's just psychological or extreme greed. In the US I guess a lot of people basically have to break into the houses because they otherwise would die of hunger and weren't able to own anything (and possibly slipped into a crime milieu because of these and other issues). And because they are forced to ""earn"" through crime and because people fell endangered enough to have rifles for protection around, they are also forced to have a gun. So in short, it goads each other, like the chicken and the egg. Know what I'm saying? Guns are a potential life-thread, no doubt about it. So wouldn't it be a smart move to try to higher the living standard of poor people in the first place, build better infrastructure and law enforcement and then maybe people will start to feel less and less forced to own guns. I couldn't imagine having one myself and having to kill somebody. Even or especially when they feel so pressured in their own life to have to break into strangers' houses to look for money. By the way: Another argument often is that guns are also supposed to protect you from government actions — here we have a pretty strong checking system for police officers, body cameras, id numbers prominently on their uniforms, a tight control from the democratically elected minister president (governor) and therefore the view people have about the police is actually a pretty good one. Police crime is existing, but a minor issue.",-1,0,1444140083,1444730322
