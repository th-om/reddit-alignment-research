cvomosi,0,t1_cvojzj0,WhamBamMaam,"I think it's a fairly poor litmus test. It extrapolates a reasonable consideration into an unreasonable embellishment. Of course everyone isn't going to do something all the time, or even close to that. Everyone's too busy with their own nonsense. So let's scale that down into a salient consideration. What if every hiker who happened to be eating an apple threw their core into some leaf litter off of the main trail? Well, you'd have about 100 or so apple cores rotting off of the main trail over the course of a season. But think of how many wild apples are doing that anyway.",3,0,1444020670,1444730772
