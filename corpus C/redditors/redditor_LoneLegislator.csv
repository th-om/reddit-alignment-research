cvqilv1,1,t3_3nq178,LoneLegislator,"Good, above average glove hand. Lets in softies occasionally. Like any goalie, was propped up last year by an immense Manchester defense in the AHL. Potential for a career backup, but could be a flash in the pan since he's got a strong mental game.",3,0,1444164177,1444730785
cvlwvae,1,t3_3n72w0,LoneLegislator,"Worth noting that he's doing this all without Dane Fox, Connor McDavid and Dylan Strome as well. Kid is the goods. ",1,0,1443808211,1444730785
cvlwdia,1,t3_3n8n7n,LoneLegislator,"The colors of the Brooklyn were not black and white and until Brett Yormark and his ""focus group"" of marketers decided it was before moving the Nets to Brooklyn. You know what colors the Brooklyn flag are? Blue and gold. You know what colors the Dodgers wore? Gray and blue. You know what colors the Americans wore? Red, white and blue. The whole idea of black and white being Brooklyn colors is a completely concocted idea that likely derives from the Kings and the Raiders trying to reach out to the more urban areas of LA and the Bay area. But guess what? Brooklyn's actually got some really nice areas, and more expensive than probably the majority of actual cities. So why do we have to define it in any certain way?

Now that's romance.",2,0,1443794059,1444730785

cvlmhc8,1,t3_3n5klo,LoneLegislator,"Optimally the situation is a starting bottom pair of Hickey-Zidlicky (unfortunately as we know it won't begin that way after all) with Zidlicky and Pulock rotating out, but honestly the idea of Pulock playing with Strait scares the crap out of me. I just don't know what other alternative there is other than Hamonic - Strait, which was seriously a horrible, terrible, no good pairing last year. If you're a believer in stats, Strait takes Hamonic down from ""above average d-man"" to ""mediocre"" real quick.",2,0,1443792231,1444730785
