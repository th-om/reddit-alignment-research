The EPA refers to it as [particle pollution, or particulate matter](http://www3.epa.gov/airquality/particlepollution/). Depend on what it's made of and how much you are exposed to, it could pose a health risk completely separate from the hygiene theory issue.",3,0,1444696551,1444716838

cvvkket,0,t1_cvvjtdh,Og_The_Barbarian,"That's fair. It's also why I find it fascinating when rich Democrats favor raising taxes on themselves and poor Republicans resist expanding Medicaid or foodstamps. Sometimes ideological considerations outweigh immediate interests. Not in this case, obviously...I'm just sayin. ",22,0,1444542002,1444716838
cvvkfrh,0,t1_cvvhx0j,Og_The_Barbarian,"That's an interesting idea, but there are a lot more local issues and officials than federal ones: state judges, sheriffs, DA, city officials, governor, state assemblies, voter initiatives, etc.

And I'm actually not sure if the federal government has the constitutional authority to count votes on behalf of the states. The electoral college is in the constitution.",4,0,1444541642,1444716838
