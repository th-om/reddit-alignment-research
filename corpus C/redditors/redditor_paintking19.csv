cunx8v1,1,t3_3jatzv,paintking19,"Indiana - Mike Pence 

Absolutely miserable. Signed a law removing power from the superintendent of public education, an elected official. Passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in direct response to gay marriage being legalized. Along with the attorney general spent millions battling gay marriage all the way up to the district court, appealing multiple times. After the Religious Freedom thing tore apart Indiana's image he hired a PR firm from NY and spent millions trying to repair our image. Just created a drug task force via executive order, yet refuses to legalize needle exchange programs. He touts a budget surplus, while letting our schools and infrastructure crumble. When elected many saw him being governor as just a stepping stone to the presidency. Now he's not even running. ",10,0,1441177941,1444725588
