cv3qpup,0,t1_cv3du1p,Mattie_Smith,"I know everyone said this kinda thing would happen, and even went so far as to use that to devalue the situation, but this makes me very happy. Any way that we can get kids interested in science will help this country and world.",1,0,1442426897,1444726926
cv2ihqe,1,t3_3kz5yr,Mattie_Smith,"I find it amazing that I and so many others here can find such appreciation in the beauty of a hunk of steel. That being said, This is B.E.A.U-tiful. Great find!",1,0,1442336870,1444726926
cux33pq,0,t1_cuw2g06,Mattie_Smith,"Sorry that everyone downvoted you. I know I sometimes get to lazy to ""watch the video"" or ""read the article"", but I would hope that after seeing it you have an idea of just how similar these arguments are.",1,0,1441913744,1444726926
cux2uxa,0,t1_cuwicrh,Mattie_Smith,"That is a fair assessment. But in a modern context, and I don't know what the written law says about this, it would appear that just as anyone can make their own religion and use that as their beliefs that one could also choose to interpret their documented religion in any way they choose. **It then becomes a question of whether or not they could continue to use that historical interpretation/belief against interracial marriage and be allowed the same accommodation that Kim Davis was given? And if it not, then can we assume that in many years we will see the same thing happen with same-sex marriage?** ",3,0,1441913374,1444726926
cuwu6v2,0,t1_cuwn8is,Mattie_Smith,"Yes. But your answer is nothing more than a brute emotional response, and it has no weight in an intelligent discussion.",0,0,1441900008,1444726926
cuwu5cw,0,t1_cuwlcj9,Mattie_Smith,Okay. Lets not get emotionally invested in this. We are simply having a discussion.,1,0,1441899942,1444726926
cuwhym4,0,t1_cuw16gv,Mattie_Smith,"Okay, this analogy actually has me tied. While I agree that it is absurd, I also understand that that is a firm belief, and it affects others in a small enough way that I can see possibly working around it. But again, I am having trouble deciding where that line is drawn, at least in my own view. Where the law is concerned, I am guessing we will see the line move a bit within the next week.

cuwhwj3,0,t1_cuw4acv,Mattie_Smith,"I will tell you that we are all VERY AWARE of such a peoples existence. That being said, bringing it up in intelligent conversation serves no positive purpose, and worse it destroys credibility of valid arguments by its association.",1,0,1441863975,1444726926
