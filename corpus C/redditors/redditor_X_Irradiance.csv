Digital watch: Wear a digital watch (one that uses those 7-segment numbers like old digital watches) and get in the habit of looking at it to see if you're dreaming. When you ARE dreaming, instead of legible numbers, the watch looks like it's broken – random segments appear and sometimes blink on and off as if it's gone spastic.

Both these techniques are 100% indicative of being in a dream.",1,1,1444688094,1444718722
cvxfg4i,1,t3_3ohkit,X_Irradiance,"I like your hypothesis, and it rings true to me somewhat – both in terms of the factors that have caused me depression and particularly those that have caused my partner a somewhat severe depression.

Yes, there are other factors, but just thinking about it, I can see how in many ways social defeat and particularly ""social helplessness"" i.e., chronic social defeat at a young age leading to an unshakeable sense of it, could be critical in depression.

Yes, people love to say that you cannot extricate genetic factors, but I really think that genetic factors alone cannot 100% induce depression. There MUST be an environmental aspect. I don't think there's depression that's wholly intractable, but there are cases that are impractical to solve.

That said, I don't think drugs are useless. Even SSRIs (IMO) really slam the brakes on the amygdala, and if everything else is roughly okay, that can be all that's needed to re-catalyze the behavior that will lead to a person feeling confident enough to start climbing the social ladder again.

When you look at drug addiction, it's pretty obvious that the problem is worst among those with the lowest social standing.

Yes, they say that ""even high functioning people"" get depressed. But, so what? I've known very highly-functional people with mysteriously poor outlooks and poor self esteem. That can be as easy as having an overly critical parent whose pernicious, reprimanding voice can be heard in one's head forever more to cast a shadow over whatever they might accomplish. Often, nothing can be good enough for these intrusive thoughts. I rather speculate that it is often rampant self-criticism that LEADS to an obsession with success in the first place.

Anyway, good thinking /u/rezadril! I'm going to have to think about this myself more deeply.",1,0,1444687395,1444718722
cvxemeq,0,t1_cvxaj1x,X_Irradiance,"It's not reading per se, it's reading something, looking away at something else, then looking back at the text to see if it reads the same thing. When you're dreaming, the words have invariably changed to some other words (but you can still read them).

And, it's not simply ""numbers"", either. It's particularly 7-segment numbers as you would see on an old digital LCD watch. Instead of properly-formed numbers, you see the segments lit up in a random way, so that much of the time they don't form recognizable numbers.

That's why they advocate buying a digital watch if you want to get into lucid dreaming, because you can check immediately if you are dreaming by looking at it.",1,1,1444686113,1444718722
cvxe8qt,0,t1_cvx80lu,X_Irradiance,"I find that in dreams there is always a coherent and believable answer as to ""why"" any such phenomenon is the way it is. E.g., ""how the fuck did an alien become president??""

Answer: ""Oh, that's right – I remember my friend telling me the whole story last year!""

And then I'll have really believable memories of that story being told to me.

cvwrt1s,1,t3_3oefih,X_Irradiance,"Aw man, this is considered ""new""? I've been trying to nut out this idea since at least 2001, and I'm pretty sure it's an older idea than that. I found a easier way to encapsulate the crux of it is to ask ""is what we are experiencing right now what is happening right now, or is there some delay?""

You'd think that it couldn't be instantaneous, because nerve signals travel at a finite speed. So, there must be a delay. But, if there is a delay between what is happening and what we are experiencing, then the present (perceived in the future) as we experience it is always a foregone conclusion by the time we actually think we're making the decisions that are affecting it. We did all that stuff some time in the past.

Now, it might be 1/10 of a microsecond, or it might be 5 minutes or 5 years. No one knows.

cvsxfff,1,t3_3o01nd,X_Irradiance,"Haha, your edit made me laugh. That's what I've been feeling about reddit lately (and I've been here for 9 years). I don't know why it's happening exactly, but I've been getting really lame-o answers to my comments, too.

In any case, I like your perspective. I feel that we're so tied up thinking that wars are created by governments and banksters over resources and egged on by a MIC that stands to benefit either way that we can't think of the benefit.

You say there seems to be a benefit in progressing society; it gets people to wake up and question the role of government itself, and for a few years at least, when the horrific memories are still relatively fresh, the peace that prevails feels genuine and productive.

I guess it's a bit like how they say that family wealth never lasts for more than three generations, and why I personally think there's no need for great people to have children – they never reach the greatness of their parents (Miley notwithstanding) because the kind of upbringing that shapes someone great is one where there IS hardship and other difficulties to overcome.

One of the things about getting a bit older (I'm 40) is that you get a better perspective on the true level of human society, and unfortunately, en masse, I'm sad to say that we're not just dumb but really childish, too. Especially here in the west.

Sure, you can take an average joe and attempt to reprogram them, show them a better way, but somehow they'll always eventually fall back. Without a personal motivation, the changes never stick. So, perhaps it has taken these ludicrous wars to wake people up.

That said, apparently the economic benefits of war are greatly overstated. Essentially, it's propaganda used to justify the war and the profits it generated for the few.

Also, would we really say that the era immediately post WW2 was particularly liberalizing? Perhaps it was really the opposition to the Vietnam War that kicked off the counter-culture movement before it was snuffed out by the spooks.

In any case, I just remembered this very informative video that I think you'll like and is very relevant to your question [""No, WW2 did not end the great depression""](https://www.corbettreport.com/no-wwii-did-not-end-the-great-depression/).

cvs3jfj,0,t1_cvryo5z,X_Irradiance,">Humans are not dogs, chimps, horses, birds or other animals. We are humans. Our brains are not designed to get satisfaction from threesomes, promiscuity, casual flings, and other purely physically pleasurable behavior.

But, nothing is 'satisfying' *ad nauseam*. The happily married man yearns for the fling, those perpetually single yearn for deep intimacy. We're wired to constantly seek out awesomeness and to constantly search for something new and different.

The best consumers are those who are strung out working 40+ hour weeks; they have money but no time and they're willing to spend. It's much easier to market the sugary side of sexuality, so that's what happens.

In any case, I really wish people would 'get over' their uneasiness regarding sexuality. It's the general lack of maturity in humanity, to the extent that it's practically impossible to have a serious discussion about it, that leads to so much injustice.

Same with drugs. Actually, the whole concept of pleasure is tainted. Just imagine how much different the world would be if no one was embarrassed about this shit.",-1,0,1444273446,1444718722
