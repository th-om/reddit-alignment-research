If they say they don't know and they'll call you back, I would press and say you need to speak to someone immediately given that this affects your ability to vote. If they still give you a hard time please post back here and I may be able to pass you a supervisor's number.

cvtvu3s,0,t1_cvtu56v,Miskellaneousness,"If you need to change your party enrollment to Democrat, today is the last day. If you use the DMV to change your party enrollment, it *almost definitely* will not make it to the BOE in time. Your only sure option at this point is to go to a county DMV and fill out the application in person.

Remember, this only applies if you are a previously registered non-Democratic NY voter. If you have never registered to vote before, the deadline is March 25th, 2016. Please let me know any questions.",1,0,1444410604,1444721013

October 9th is, beyond a shred of doubt, the deadline for party enrollment changes.

>  I can't find any mention of this on the official page

And yes, one would never know based on the BOE website. One would still be confused even after reading the election law itself. I have called the BOE numerous times to complain about the deadline not being prominently displayed on the website, and they have essentially agreed that it isn't clear, but said they will take no action to change it.

If you want to confirm the deadline, call the BOE Public Information Office at (518) 474-1953.",1,0,1444404133,1444721013

""I'm not here to play a game of labels. My opponents want to use these labels to scare voters and drive the conversation away from the issues facing our nation. I will not stand for it. I believe that capitalism drives great innovation and prosperity. At the same time, as countries across the world have demonstrated, the public is better served when the government is more active in certain industries.

The United States spends more for health care than <insert healthcare stump here>.

So I believe that when we see other countries providing for their citizens more effectively and more efficiently than we are, we should learn from them. Absolutely. I don't think voters should be scared of that.""",28,0,1444351573,1444721013
