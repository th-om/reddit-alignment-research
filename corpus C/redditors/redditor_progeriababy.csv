There would be no corporations or corporate interests. There wouldn't be a monopoly because communities would have their own democratically decided laws.""

Any time there's voting, there is a monopoly.  In fact, that's the reason for voting, it's why the concept of voting exists, to try to give people some measure of a voice in a monopoly run system.  anytime there is only one provider, that is a monopoly, no matter how the monopoly allows the people to vote.  a democracy is necessarily always run by a monopoly.  Plus, how is this system paid for?  Taxes, no doubt.

On top of that, voting is a very poor way of getting your voice heard.  Consider: if there's no monopoly, there's literally no reason at all to vote, because the providers of the service therefore exist in a market where they get a much higher quantity and quality of information in real time via their customers purchases.  Think of it like this:  Imagine someone said:
""There wouldn't be a monopoly because communities would have their own democratically decided shoes"".  and they were talking about a society where shoes were decided by vote.  People had the right to vote on everything about their shoes.  Every single aspect of the shoes were up for vote... isn't that amazing, see how much freedom we have and choices we have!  we get to vote on the material the shoes are made from, the color, the size, the laces, the pattern of the laces... everything!  And the shoes are totally free!  Not like in your society where everyone has to buy their shoes.  

Except of course the fact that the taxes they would pay for their shoes far exceeds the cost of a pair on the market (since they are also paying for the infrastructure of tax collectors, vote counters, administrators, etcetc.), and the quality of the shoes is far lower, since as a monopoly, they have no incentive to make quality shoes.  And once everyone's voted, the results are counted and everyone gets the same exact shoes.  

Meanwhile in a market, you don't have to vote since there are so many companies providing shoes.  Theres no reason to have a vote, you just pick the ones you want.  

The market for protection services would likely be more similar to the market for cell phones or insurance or even like the hair stylist/barber market, but the result is the same.  On the market, there is no tyranny-of-the-majority... because nothing is forced on anyone.  

>""ultimately, given a limited set of communities and arbitrators, you will probably end up with one that is not EXACTLY to your liking.""

true, but you will get one that is far more in line with your preferences than in a democracy.  and that isn't even the main benefit of a market system.  some more important things to consider are the cost, quality, and level of corruption.  In a democracy, you are paying far more for a given good or service provided by the government than you would it were provided by the free market.  If you remember ""Friedman's Law"" from the book, it says anything done by government costs at least twice as much as a privately provided equivalent.  That's actually amazingly accurate.  If you look at public education versus private schools, for example:  On average, it costs more than $11,000 dollars to send one student to public school for a year; but it costs about $5,500 to send a student to a private school for a year.  [David Henderson has a blog post with some more evidence for Friedman's Law](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/06/friedmans_law.html).

Quality is also much higher when there's competition, since without that competition, there's no incentive driving high the quality of service or goods.  This well known economic fact is evidenced by the behavior of employees at the DMV, public schools, police, the quality of government infrastructure, etc.  And the level of corruption... as I explained before, when you have a single provider of law, you have nothing stopping corruption.  I won't explain in detail, since I already did in the previous comment. 

As for the eye-contact example, I do understand what you're saying.  Any very small minority culture will have problems if they have customs that are significantly different from the norm in any society.  But the point of the book and of ancaps in general, is that an ancap society is likely (but not 100% guaranteed) to be a very libertarian society since, when you're paying directly for your legal system instead of just voicing your preference without the costs in mind (like voting), you are far more likely to choose only the things that are honestly most important to you.  And for most people, the things that are most important to them are to be protected from direct aggression.  I'll use flag-burning as an example, if you had to pay X amount extra per month to be sure that anyone burning a flag in your area would be prosecuted, most people would rather save that money and not care about somebody burning some fabric.  it's only when the costs are obscured by a tax system do people choose superfluous non-violent activity as ""crimes"".

**EDIT: I realized how much of an asshole I sounded like after I reread this first paragraph, sorry again.**
...um.  Yeah.  I honestly find it hard to believe you actually read through one of the most highly regarded and potent books ever written specifically about why a free market on law would be preferable to a monopoly on law, and still not at least know why an anarcho-capitalist would find that statement laughable.  I really do think you need to re-read the book.  I'm sorry if that sounds overly douchebaggy, but really.  It's the premise of the book.  Every chapter explains a different aspect of that theme.  Anyway, sorry.  Let me try to explain.  

**EDIT**:That sounded very asshole-y.  I do apologize.  Let me try to explain it even better:
In the US, there is essentially one government.  There are different states, and the way they were originally set up was quasi-market like (since states had much more control).  But even if all the states had totally different laws, and even if the federal government wasn't the de facto overruling force in every legal contest between states and fed, even if all that were true... it still isn't anything like an anarcho-capitalist society.  Ancap legal systems, as described in the Machinery of Freedom, are individual profit-driven companies competing with each other on the free market.  If a police officer is an asshole to you, what recourse do you have now?  you could try to go file a complaint.  you'll probably end up getting harassed for the rest of your life by his fellow gang members.  

However, if an employee of a private protection service is an asshole to you, what recourse do you have?  you can also file a complaint, and it's far more likely to be followed up on... why?  because the ultimate recourse you have is to stop paying them and choose a different company.  you don't have to move, you don't have to do paperwork and uproot your life.  you are in charge.  as a result of that completely different power dynamic, the private protection employees/guards/whatever are unlikely to ever be remotely rude to you, become corrupt, or do anything that will compromise their market position.   **end edit**

And, as far as your personal favorite economic system goes, you can absolutely have that in an ancap society, if you live with like-minded people and they all want some sort of mutualist system, and they want to pay whatever it would cost in terms of sacrifices in other areas (for example, if someone wants all currently illegal drugs to remain illegal, they would have to pay a much higher price to their particular private protection company, since the ones who don't patrol for, and prosecute, non-violent drug users will have far fewer costs; and if you want to live in a socialist community, you will have to be prepared to live in a much less prosperous community than most others).  In other words, there really are no ""property norms"" in a truly ancap society.  they're discovered via the market where people live, and the rules they choose to live under.  

Now, as for the ""you can't get everything you want..."" comment.  Centralization and monopolies breed corruption.  When you have a single monopoly on law that uses force to remain in power, they have zero incentive to do their job well.  By ""well"", I mean to the satisfaction of their customers.  In fact, monopoly governments don't consider their citizens customers at all.  On top of that, the government quickly becomes the strong arm of large corporations, since they are the ones with enough money to influence those in power.  Corporations use their influence to push through regulations that benefit them.  Friedman lists a large number of examples.  I can give you one that isn't in the book:  the Chinese lead paint scare.  

Some years ago, in the 90s, there were some toys imported from China which were painted with lead paint.  Parental special interest groups raised the alarm and called for regulations to ""protect our children"".  Those special interest groups also had executives from several of the largest US toy manufacturers as their major financial donors.  This is called the ""bootleggers and baptists"" situation, where two different groups get together to push some law, one group naive and morally clean, and the other financially supporting the first because they have a financial interest in the law.  The bootleggers supported the Baptists push to get prohibition pushed through in the 20s.  Thats where the name comes from.  anyway...

The government put together a regulatory committee consisting of members of the board of directors of most of the largest toy makers in the US, ostensibly because they knew the most about the industry.  This committee decided to enact some regulations that forced anyone selling toys in the US to have those toys undergo expensive testing to become certified before they're allowed to be sold.  The practical upshot of this?  Most of the small toymakers and boutique toy makers within the US went out of business overnight, since they couldn't afford the expensive testing.  Who gained that market share?  The major manufacturers.  ALL regulations passed in the US for the past 100+ years have held some financial benefit for some special corporate group or another.  That is the reason they exist.  In a anarcho-capitalistic society, that sort of corruption would be far more difficult, since ""regulation"" would happen via market mechanisms instead of via a top-down centralized system controlled by a monopoly.  

Now this is just ONE reason why the market is better than a democracy.  The book is filled with them, on every single page.  Another book I recommend is 'the myth of the rational voter' by bryan caplan.  ",1,0,1443743110,1444725333

That's a great insight.  This is what I am always trying to explain to people who argue against anarcho-capitalism.  I say that in an ancap society, you can have literally any form of community you like, so long as you have like-minded people together in an area.  Anyone with any political or economic ideals can live there in the way they like.  

But I think you should re-read the machinery of freedom just to get more of a feel for it.  Also, David Friedman's blog is called [Ideas](http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/) and his personal website is [DavidDFriedman.com](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/).  I read his blog everyday, and his personal website has a whole list of resources to read through, like essays, articles, audio and video recording of various classes he's taught, etc.  Lots of stuff.  

Anyway, as far as what you said about ""capitalist property norms""...there are generally two schools of thought when it comes to anarcho-capitalism... the rothbardian/deontological (the ""natural rights""/NAP types); and the consequentialist (Friedman's approach).  So when he says:

>""It seems to me that he is obviously willing to at least question the capitalist property-norms.""
and
> But Friedman admits that even the capitalist property-norms also have limitations that are essentially arbitrary. 

Nope.  He's not admitting anything about ""capitalist"" property norms.  He's talking about the natural rights ancaps.  He even says it here:

>It is easy enough to show reasons why the conversion of common property into private property is a good thing - why it makes us better off - but it is very much harder to derive property in land from some a priori theory of **natural rights**.

Many NAP (non-aggression principle) ancaps are moving towards the consequentialist school because of that very problem.  I mean... the whole book is basically in praise of property rights.  The very first chapter is called ""In Defense of Property"".  It's really the theme of the book if you could say it has one. 

also, you say:
>I particularly liked his depiction of private arbitrators and laws determined by the market. But I think he and other AnCaps/Libertarians I've talked to duly criticize democracy for being a tyranny of the majority. But, in that regard, how are systems of laws determined by the free market any different?

The legal system in a democracy is a monopoly.  There is only one, and it has a monopoly on violence and law.  An ancap society is the absence of monopoly.  Changing laws is as easy as switching providers.  

Arnold Kling puts it like this:

>""The absence of monopoly means that you can exercise exit, even if you cannot exercise voice. The presence of monopoly means that, at most, you can exercise voice.

>Neither my local supermarket nor any of its suppliers has a way for me to exercise voice. They don't hold elections. They don't have town-hall meetings where they explain their plans for what will be in the store. By democratic standards, I am powerless in the supermarket.

>And yet, I feel much freer in the supermarket than I do with respect to my county, state, or federal government. For each item in the supermarket, I can choose whether to put it into my cart and pay for it or leave it on the shelf. I can walk out of the supermarket at any time and go to a competing grocery.

And when Friedman talks about ""agoric institutions"", he does it in a very offhand way, in one sentence in the smallest chapter in the book.  He never mentions it again in the book.  What he's actually talking about is now called ""autarchism"", and it's based on the ideas of Robert LeFevre.  LeFevre knew very little about economics, but was an extremely staunch individualist.  

What Freidman is saying in that one single sentence is basically that he puts individual liberty above most other things and would prefer to live in a community where that it paramount.  That's all.  He's not making a statement about what some people call Agorism today.  ",2,0,1443738074,1444725333

It's hard to point to any single place that gives a really complete picture of transhumanism.  But if you look around and read what prominent ancaps write, you'll see they are oftentimes transhumanists.  For example, David Friedman, one of the most often quoted fathers of anarcho-capitalism, is a transhumanist.  He has never called himself that outright, but if you read his blog [Ideas](http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/), you'll see a pretty strong transhumanist bent (for instance: [this one about mind uploading, artificial wombs, and using virtual reality to create heaven on earth](http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2006/11/darwin-reproduction-and-religion.html)).  There are quite a few prominent ancap economists who talk that way.  Bryan Caplan is one.  Arnold Kling is another.  The list could go on for a while.  

But if you want one single place to get an idea of their philosophy, check out [Humanity+](http://humanityplus.org/) (it used to be called the World Transhumanist Association), it's a fairly good place to start.  They're the largest transhumanist society in the world and most of the biggest names of transhumanism are associated with them in some way or another.  They also publish H+ Magazine. 

Natasha Vita-More is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Humanity+, she and her husband, Max More, are both ancaps and transhumanists.    

Max More was the founder of the Extropy Institute, and wrote an essay called [""order without orderers""](http://www.maxmore.com/Order_Without_Orderers.htm) that's about how important what he calls ""spontaneous orders"" (like the free market) are to transhumanist goals.  Instead of using the term ""libertarian"" though, he calls it ""spontaneous voluntarism"" or a ""maximally consensual system"".  He's written some very ardent anarcho-capitalist essays.  One of the main principle's of More's Extropy Institute was called ""spontaneous order"" and he explained it as:

>""Supporting decentralized, voluntaristic social coordination processes. Fostering tolerance, diversity, foresight, personal responsibility and individual liberty.

Also on the Humanity+ board of directors:

-[José Cordeiro](http://www.cordeiro.org/): an ancap economist who, in addition to the H+ board... is either the founder, president, or a major chairperson or member of literally 10-15 well known think tanks, futurist societies, and economic associations.  And for some bizarre reason, he still doesn't have a wikipedia page of his own.   

-Patri Friedman was (and might still be) on the Humanity+ board too.  In addition to being the son of David Friedman and grandson of Milton Friedman, Patri is the founder of the Seasteading Institute (he stepped down but is still on the board, I believe), the founder of the Future Cities Development Corporation (which planned to start building in the [special economic zone in Honduras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_for_Employment_and_Economic_Development_(Honduras)), blogger about ancap, rationalist, and other issues, AND a really cool guy.

-Gabriel Rothblatt, who I went to college with, is also on the Humanity+ board.  Here's the deal with him, though.  He's a closet anarcho-capitalist.  Trust me on this.  He says he's a ""technoprogressive"" and vocally supports a few mainstream, non-libertarian things like his stance on healthcare... but he really just wants to get into politics so he sanitized his views.  He's been a supporter of seasteading for as long as I remember

I don't think Peter Thiel, the libertarian billionaire, is on the Humanity+ board, but he's always been closely associated with Humanity+.  He usually just calls himself a libertarian, but his opinions say otherwise, and he comes off sounding like an anarcho-capitalist almost always.  He said ""I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible"" in [The Education of a Libertarian](http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian).  

Thiel also started The Thiel Foundation, which funds groups involved in ""freedom, science and technology, and anti-violence"".  So it's basically a pacifist transhumanist anarcho-capitalist philanthropy.  He gave money to Patri's Seasteading Institute, Eliezer Yudkowsky's Singularity Institute, and both of Aubrey de Grey's anti-aging groups: SENS Research Foundation and the Methuselah Foundation.

-Jonathan Cain is the president of the Thiel Foundation, and on the boards of both the transhumanist SENS Foundation and the ancap Seasteading Institute.  

-James O’Neil is also on the boards of the SENS Foundation, the Seasteading Institute, and the Thiel Foundation.  

-Eliezer Yudkowsky is a co-founder of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (which used to be called the Singularity Institute when Peter Thiel funded it) and one of the people who started LessWrong, the rationality blog.  He describes himself as a minarchist but is, in my opinion, a strong breeze away from becoming an anarcho-capitalist.  

**TL;DR: Jesus christ did I just write all that?  I could keep going too, but my point is, there are a lot of ancap transhumanists.**
