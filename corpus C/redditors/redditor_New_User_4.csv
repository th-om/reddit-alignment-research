cvu9pdp,0,t1_cvu78c5,New_User_4,"Artistic embellishment. The line for that has to be drawn somewhere though, and I think unless it's patently impossible, like sound in space, if it's on screen it's cannon. Otherwise, Greedo shot first and ""parsecs"" are a speed measurement. 

I agree it's stupid, but that is what we consistently see on screen. But that's why star wars is science fantasy, not science fiction. ",1,0,1444432494,1444721033

cvty5uf,0,t1_cvtwlfl,New_User_4,"Show me anything that'll trump Newton. They already utilize intertial dampeners to not turn the pilot to paste, they could very well build the thing out of paper. 

Far as I know there's only been one or two incidents of a USAF Hornet or Super Hornet being shot down. ",5,0,1444414045,1444721033
cvtxzvt,0,t1_cvtwllv,New_User_4,"They show them using a targeting computer at point blank. Also, the prequel movies only showed use of a targeting computer once or twice (maybe only in TPM) and even then it was all at knife range. Every time we see the use of a targeting computer in the films, it seems damn near pointless since the pilots invariably could also just reach out and bop the enemy on the head.

Also the T.I.E. Starfighter's armament was, as far as I can tell, never revealed. It's cannonicity is also dubious even in the expanded universe. The TIE/LN is what everyone thinks of when you say ""TIE fighter"". ",5,0,1444413798,1444721033
cvtwia7,0,t1_cvtsqjz,New_User_4,"Correction, TIE fighters have a Titanium hull. Not durasteel. 

Also, the *Ford* is brand new and has never hosted Tomcats, nor will it.  The *Enterprise* would be more accurate.",16,0,1444411580,1444721033

cvtw7ov,0,t1_cvtporb,New_User_4,"Titanium alloy hull on TIE/LN fighters. Their max atmo  speed is listed as 1,200 KPH, which is literally a quarter the max speed of an F-14/a and a little over half the speed of later models, at 2,889 KPH and 2099 KPH respectively. 

In atmosphere, the TIE Starfighter is basically a jumbo jet as far as any 4th Generation USAF fighter is concerned. Slow, can't maneuver, and might as well not be able to shoot back. ",6,0,1444411152,1444721033
cvtvy0d,0,t1_cvtqj7k,New_User_4,"Yep, no shields, only a titanium alloy hull. Basically, they're no more armored than any 4th gen fighter.",2,0,1444410765,1444721033
cvtvwxl,0,t1_cvtrewn,New_User_4,"Counter point! The only TIE Fighter to incorporate a concussion missile launcher was the TIE/gt and it would have required assistance from a TIE/fc in order to target a Tomcat. The production model TIE/LN never utilized, nor was the frame capable of mounting, a concussion missile launcher. 

Also furthermore, no cannon information is available about the sensor systems of TIE/LN fighters and all cannon and most Legends material suggests line of sight, visual range combat was the  norm for laser dog fights in space. You may thank George Lucas for that bit of stupidity. 

And also, no TIE fighter series besides the Defender and Hunter carried Ion cannons. 

Your move, sir.",10,0,1444410722,1444721033
