cvxloij,0,t1_cvxdg6p,pankpankpank,">I mean, none of the rebels wear uniforms, and if you were to see one ISIS member and one non-ISIS rebel standing next to each other, it would be impossible to tell the difference. It seems to me like ISIS could easily send in spies to infiltrate the other rebel groups and that it would be practically impossible for anyone to know.

Uniforms and war have meant little for a long time. Ever see what the CIA's SAD/SOG operatives look like? These are the upper echelon soldiers in our entire military, and they aren't required to wear uniforms, can grown beards, have long hair, etc... Not too long ago there was a giant piece in the NY Times about an ex-Seal Team 6 member, and he described the environment between missions (they are literally on missions on almost a daily basis) as reminiscent to ""pirates of the caribbean."" My point being, uniforms don't mean anything in guerilla warfare, people generally know who is fighting for who, the militias are all in line with specific leaders and hold specific positions. 

>There is also the problem that ISIS and the other rebels are technically on the same side when it comes to the war against Assad. That means that even if they are two distinct groups, they might still occasionally work as allies. Plus, ISIS seems to have a lot of money and support. That means that even if they are two distinct groups and even if none of the other rebels become allies with ISIS, ISIS might very well be able to defeat the other rebel groups and simply take those rebels' weapons for themselves. In my opinion, all of this adds up to say that we should not be arming rebels in Syria.

There is nowhere near consensus among the rebels and ISIS on what to do with Assad. The problem with ISIS is they are actually highly fragmented, highly dispersed, and not very well coordinated. Therefore, certain sects under the umbrella of ISIS may join the rebels in their fight for the right reasons, but those same ISIS members may be at odds with the overall regime. In most cases, the rebels do not want ISIS to help as they know that ISIS's motivation is to take over in the event that they win. Therefore, the rebels have no motivation to let ISIS achieve any victory in Syria

>Also, I don't think that Assad is a great guy or anything, but I don't think we should be removing him. He is harsh and has definitely done things that the West would consider to be human rights violations, but look at what he's working with. His biggest and most formidable opposition is ISIS. There are many other terrorist groups and hard-line Islamists in and around Syria as well. When you are a secular ruler surrounded by people like that, it might unfortunately be necessary to execute a few every once in a while. Otherwise, they will take over the country, execute you and your entire family, and set up Sharia law.

The crisis in Syria began in 2012. Assad had a secret police force that carried out assassinations, torture, and mass imprisonment for anyone that opposed his regime. When the protests began, he did not respond in kind, but instead killed protesters, medical workers, and innocent people which sparked the civil war. Assad is a horrible human being, and not someone you want in power in any state. 

>The West has a difficult time accepting this because we operate so differently, but I do believe that Middle Eastern rulers like Assad should be given a little more leeway than other governments. I'm not saying turn a blind eye to everything, but we should be considering what the alternative governments would be like before we oust someone like Assad.

It's not about Sharia law or what his governance style was like, it was the fact he had secret police and massive human rights abuses akin to Hitler. I agree the West has a difficult time understanding that democracy is far more than just voting--in order to label a democracy as such. These countries need support systematically from the bottom up: they need institutions, civil rights, infrastructure, etc....not just Western government that basically comes down to fake voting. 

I'm with you on the West have a vast misunderstanding of Middle Eastern culture, but saying ""give Assad a chance,"" is ridiculous, considering the allegations began long before the uprising ",1,1,1444697397,1444717980
cvxkc2z,1,t3_3oiqej,pankpankpank,"I was 13--but can actual remember that election fairly vividly. John McCain used to be a great guy. At least as far as public appearances are concerned. 

He also was known as more of an independent than the hardline republican he is now. With age, he is 79 after all, he's become a lot more hardline and hawkish on issues of war. Ironically, I think his age is the main difference between then and now. He's simply getting too old for the job, and a bit senile, I'm not going to lie.

But back to his dramatically different stances on especially foreign policy--he even used to have the nickname ""Maverick"" because he was independent on a number of controversial votes. He opposed military operations in Somalia, took on the Tobacco Industry, he really was willing to go after people and say things that others were not. Mix that independent slant with his POW background and fairly pristine senate career, and he was maybe a few years (and a Sarah Palin) away from being a serious presidential contender. 

He changed dramatically with age, that's the only way I think I can put it

I can actually buy up to $300 I think is my limit?--through my card each week, effortlessly. No wire required, its an instant transfer. It's extremely simple just understand that Bitcoin, as a virtual currency, is quite high so figure out the fraction that equals the amount you want for your order. 

As far as other sights on the clearnet, Cat is definitely the way to go. I think I've been a customer for at least 2 years? Maybe I am wrong and they haven't been running that long but I can tell you I was one of their first customers from the start. They are a no bullshit, fair and legit business that sells the real products.

I've never had a problem on any of my orders, but definitely get yourself set up on Circle for bitcoin. Getting a 20% discount on your first order, plus an additional 10% off each subsequent order is actually a really really good deal. Never had a package lost, seized, delivered improperly. They are a great site and I would definitely stick with them--and trust me I am no shill when I am stating all of this, I rarely comment on vendors.

I would say my longest order ever was maybe 12 days? Either way, +/- 7 days has been the average for me overall. I also wouldn't worry about getting a seizure in customs.

Yes, because the U.S. wanted to spend $6 trillion to keep the war on terror ongoing because........?????

>First it was Saddam who took babies out of incubators to kill them, then it was Milosovic who build concentration camps like the Nazis, then Gaddafi was the biggest threat to international peace because he wanted nukes, then it was Saddam again. 9/11 comes around and it should be Saudi Arabia but its Afghanistan instead. Then its Saddam again for whatever bullshit reason, then its Qaddafi getting some again, even after being the Good Guy for quite some years, then Assad is the most oppressive dictator in the world, dont forget the Russians not being cool with the US lead coup in the Ukraine and finally the reincarnation of evil, monsters only hell could spawn. ISIS. Made possible and propped up by the US to destabilize the region and to target Iran the Jihadis did exactly what they were supposed to do.

Lol. I have to put my tinfoil hat on for most of this response but I assume you are speaking of the Saudi Arabia funding for 9/11? So we should have invaded Saudi Arabia, due to funding, rather than the terror-militarized state of Afghanistan that carried out the attacks regardless of what claims lay to the Saudis? Okay. 

So Assad was a good dictator in spite of all of this? He wasn't being oppressive against his people? Not enough for 330,000 people to die? Okay.

>You dont see ISIS attacking any US ally.

Iraq? Iraq? Iraq? Aka the country we supposedly liberated. ISIS displaying our failure at the national stage to an even greater extent? Yes, we wanted to create a giant uncontrollable radical group in order to target Iran, Sure....yes makes sense. What the fuck. 

>Yeah. The same propaganda outlets that told you Saddam has WMDs, Milosevic has concentration camps, the Taliban are responsible for 9/11.

Tinfoil intensifies. I still have yet to see ANYWHERE the U.S. profits from any of this? So we created a radical group to embarrass ourselves, get involved with a state that dissolved by its own means, because.....???????

And that's why it received the highest ""false"" ratings across every fact checking organization across the board. 

>Same goes for that IS intercepted air drops. They frequently get US care packages and all of these were interceptions? You seriously believe that the most advanced, technically sophisticated, simply the best military in the world constantly fucks up delivering air drops to the Kurds and gives them to ISIS instead?

Yes, air drops are not advanced, or technically sophisticated. They are literally dropping wooden crates containing weapons. Without special forces, or U.S. troops on the ground on the receiving end, bad intelligence can easily send air drops into the wrong hands.

>Same goes for the US training effort. You really think that the CIA is a bunch of dumb asses who train John Jihad and didnt know he lied about his affiliation when he signed up?

The CIA has been training radicals for decades. Who knows what they were thinking during training. It's not like they have a pristine record at not fucking up.

They aren't idiots you are just trying to simplify a highly highly complicated conflict. What interest does the U.S. have in arming ISIS? What interest does John McCain have in visiting ""ISIS?""
