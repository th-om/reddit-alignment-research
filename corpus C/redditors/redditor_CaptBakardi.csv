I'm an English major, so it might not surprise you that my biggest attraction to Sailor Moon is the story. I feel that the subtle details of the real world that get woven together with the fictional story make for a really entertaining read/watch. The fight scenes are, as a 31 year old who is in love with Kamen Rider, quite lame by most standards. The animation is typical of the era and the music is memorable for me but likely only because of the nostalgia factor. So, the characters and story are the real sellers for me with each character being stronger than their stereotypical archetype feature. While Mercury is smart, she's also open to learning about the social world she has all but forsworn which provides her growth. That's just a small example but Moon's greatest feature isn't her strength or even courage as both are questionable. However, her just genuine good is so strong that she is able to overcome any obstacle (and those she can't, she her good draws those that would help her to overcome any obstacle). It is just a pretty good/feel good story with a great mythos.

I could go on about the relationships be it strong friendships (Chibi/Saturn), rivalries (Mars/Moon), or some of the most beautiful love (even though there isn't much reason I feel this way I think...) with Neptune and Uranus.

The love shown in the series is fictional but its great as an exaggerated version of real life loves. So, while married and in love with my wife, I find it hard to compare any fictional relationship with ours.

Hope this helps and good luck with your thesis and travels! I loved my years in Japan.",2,0,1443550094,1444725349

cvaky7d,0,t1_cvaii77,CaptBakardi,"[Up front I would like to admit that I haven't come up with a solid understanding as to why Haruto acts the way he does leading up to the climax. That said, I do believe there's more that isn't being considered by you and to a far greater extent by others so please allow me to try and work through these things. First, We have to remember that one of the Kamen Rider leitmotif is that his/her powers come from the same source as the villains, therefore Haruto becoming Wizard is more of someone taking a bad thing and using it for good. 
That is literally my favorite part of Kamen Rider -aside from the suits and 'henshin'- because it is such a fantastic and underutilized story device. That said, you crack open an important can of worms that I'd like to address as it is extremely important. The movies are varying levels of canonical. It doesn’t make sense that someone would see a monster in episode 1 of new series and not expect hero of previous series to show up, and thus it isn’t addressed -though that’s a great idea for a transition in my opinion-. However, even if a parallel dimensions type of situation, there are multiple Kamen Riders. Hell, the last two episodes of Wizard even COMPLETELY validate that each series is canon. This is important for a few reasons that we’ll come back to.] (/spoiler)

[There can be no light without the dark. This is, of course, sad but seemingly unavoidable in fiction and in reality. What I mean is, Kamen Riders cannot be heroes without villains -though this is equally true for any medium/property-. This means that without evil there cannot be good. So accepting that, we can assume the inverse is true and ultimately that’s sort of what Kamen Rider has always ridden -pun intended- on. So much evil, and then we get a good out of it. So, for the world of Wizard -all but the last two episodes-, you say there is no good that comes from magic. However, the ultimate coup de grace would be that Haruto eliminates Gremlin and prevents his goals. Additionally, Nitoh stops the Sabbath and eliminates that. So at the very least, magic has brought good into the world. On a much smaller scale, the joy that Shunpei feels as a mage -chichin pui!- is most definitely a positive though it was ultimately introduced to present something to be removed. The girl who’s name escapes me that was stealing from all the men had her life entirely changed -though we see her semi-justified reasoning in the end- by magic and Haruto specifically. So I think we can at least agree that magic isn’t all bad.] (/spoiler)

[Why would Haruto want more mages? If you give it deep thought -which I don’t think any character in the show did but yet here you and I are- then you realize that a gate has the ability to conquer their phantom and become a mage or to succumb to despair and lose their life to their phantom. This isn’t 100% conclusive as it seems Gremlin’s schtick is that he doesn’t have the soul to begin with and perhaps was even born with the phantom in control -though I find it hilarious to picture him as an infant giving in and suffering from despair because his pacifier was dropped or something-. You posit that Haruto’s best course of action is prevent any more mages so no one has to suffer that because so few survive. I think that it not being addressed is a huge problem and there’s two main points to it.] (/spoiler)

[1) Haruto alone cannot save every Gate and realizes this thus welcoming more mages as possible.] (/spoiler)

[2) A gate is ALWAYS a risk. The show only demonstrates people being forced into despair and risking becoming a phantom. However, Gremiln may very well prove this point. He may not however as I believe he was part of the first Sabbath at the very least being present. But think about it, if a Gate is missed and loses their dog/dad/mom/loved one and goes into despair and then becomes a Phantom, that’s a huge problem. If you want to remove the self-imposed TV rules, Haruto is only in Japan! What about people giving into despair in Australia? Wouldn’t we need mages there? And so on.] (/spoiler)

[Ultimately, I’m not sure what his reasoning was. Perhaps it was some combination of this legitimate need for more mages, a lapse in judgement, blind rage, etc. ] (/spoiler)

[In the end, I love that Nitoh gets to take the hero role in order to save the masses though Haruto gets to have the 1v1 to end the inevitable evil. It’s fitting for each of them and great to show multifaceted threats for the heroes.] (/spoiler)

[The Gremlin fight is huge for a few reasons. It is a great example of pure good vs pure evil. It is an unredeemable human AND phantom fighting the titular hero. It is the one person that Wizard was made to save being saved as he redeems his inability to save her to begin with. Making her the ring that is the source of his power so he can carry her with him forever is beautiful. The ending is outstanding for me and the fact that Dragon even calls him on using his -dragon’s- power for his own ends for the first time ever is awesome. Haruto taps into the power not to save someone but to redeem his friend’s soul. The same soul tainted by the villain that he is trying to defeat and every single one he beat along the way. Beautiful.] (/spoiler)

[As for villain disposal, Phoenix is shown as a ruffian from the get go. He’s still a person -not literally though potentially literally- inside and has feelings but his personality is such that SCREW YOU AND YOUR FEELINGS AND MAKING ME HAVE THEM. So really, it’s a crapshoot to me that he would either “you’re right, help me fix this” or “SCREW YOU..” and so on. I think him choosing to stay the course of evil shows him as unredeemable and that Wizard realizes this and takes action based on this to stop him -forever- is another beautiful capstone that they wrote in. As for Medusa, I think a big bad killing of their Lieutenant who seemed super bad by just disposing of them is another great writing choice. I think the fact that it literally causes despair for her is pretty appropriate and as sad as it is, it is her comeuppance.] (/spoiler)

[Wizard and Drive can be compared any way you want but you can do the same with all the riders. They have their own stories and I think the positives and quirks of each should be celebrated. There are no genuinely bad apples in the bunch as they each have things that are great about them. -Granted, I haven’t seen every Rider series to its conclusion…yet-.] (/spoiler)

I apologize for being so long winded as I feel I lost a few points I wanted to add in here but I just have to indulge in such a great opportunity. Also, to be safe, just going to spoiler the whole post...as soon as I figure out how.
