cvqqejs,0,t1_cvqabge,plausibleD,"Why shouldn't the argument be framed that way? Why do you decide what is legitimate violence and what is not? 

Maybe it's the fact that the few in control are the ones that have a monopoly on violence. They frame the argument the way they do in order to keep power to themselves. Maybe they know that framing the legitimacy of violence in another way will equalize power amongst people.

You are quick to use the conventional wisdom in favor of the status quo; quick to minimize the hardships of a job loss, while being quick to gloss over the orders of magnitude of greater violence perpetrated by those who are in control. 

Just as an example: which should be seen as more legitimate violence, the violence of corporations that can cause the death of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of individuals, or the violence that happened in this case, leading to the loss of (by my knowledge) nothing more than fine clothing? The end result of both types of violence is the same; someone gets to keep more money and therefore, more control. Which violence should be viewed as more legitimate?",-1,0,1444177037,1444720929

cvn7dra,0,t1_cvn2a1f,plausibleD,"Everyone doesn't have a birth certificate. Those that do were given them according to the rules of the state. Why? Because it's the states job to identify it's own people. 

People need jobs. Finding and registering citizens is one of the more legitimate ones in my opinion. If the state needs money it should tax those that benefit the most in order to meet its obligations to its people. Many of these states won't even take free (to them) federal dollars just because they don't want to give their own citizens healthcare. 

It's never been about the legitimacy of the vote. It's always been about delegitimizing a certain segment of the population.",1,0,1443912653,1444720929
