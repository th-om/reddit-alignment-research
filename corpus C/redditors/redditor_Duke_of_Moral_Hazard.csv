Colbert did something similar recently, proposing that middle-aged men who drive sports cars display a bumper sticker the size of their penis. Now I love me some Colbert, and I get that the target of the joke was compensating behavior but the implication, that only men with big dicks deserve sports cars, is undeservedly shaming (and he should know better).

""Small dick"" has become a shorthand insult for male insecurity. I'm all for poking fun at childish insecurity (""Mexicans are raping our women!"" ""I'm still cool and relevant!"") but the shorthand is too easy, obfuscating what are assuredly a variety of issues, not to mention undeservedly shaming millions of men who might very much like to accept themselves.",15,0,1444664145,1444725090

Her: Thank you. I washed it!

You: <laugh> You've inspired me. Next week for sure.

Her: <laugh> I can't wait to see that.

You: So...it's a date?

Now it's up to her, and she can let you down without anyone losing face. Obviously, a script probably isn't going to work, but just throw anything out there (restaurant you want to try, play you want to see, etc.).

cvh4o3d,0,t1_cvh1uvq,Duke_of_Moral_Hazard,"I get that they probably don't dwell on bad shit, but Watney has an awful lot of time to watch sitcoms and listen to disco. I know it's not *Castaway* in space but a little emotion, and his experience of having emotions, would have made the book feel more realistic to me.

But that being said, I think it will make an awesome movie, especially if Damon & Co. give us more of the character than Weir does.",1,0,1443463992,1444725090

Like, we never have his thoughts and feelings about the possibility of dying (what it means to him, etc.). That may be a by-product of the diary format, but my point was just that it lends itself well to a visual medium.",2,0,1443463593,1444725090
cvh0xz8,0,t1_cvgzxof,Duke_of_Moral_Hazard,"You're right that the book is not great. Primarily because Watney is never in any real danger. Of course, we know that because he's the main character, but he seems to know it, too. At least, he never worries much about his plight and what that means to him. But this is perfect for a movie that can't spend time in the character's head anyway (ham-fisted voice-over narration excepted).

Anyway, since the book mostly reads like a movie treatment, I expect good things from the adaptation.",0,0,1443458439,1444725090
