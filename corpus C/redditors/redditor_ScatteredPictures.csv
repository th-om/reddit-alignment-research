cvx0p6b,0,t1_cvww9dl,ScatteredPictures,"You'd be surprised at the amount of Democrats who still get elected in West Virginia at local levels, despite being a solid red state at a presidential level. Our state legislature just got a Republican majority last year for the first time since before FDR. We haven't even had a Republican governor for awhile.

Granted, most of these guys are only Democrats in the sense that they like social programs and unions, there's really nothing ""liberal"" about them in the areas of social issues or especially environmental protection.

I'm pretty liberal myself and I have mixed feelings on Senator Byrd.",1,0,1444665757,1444716733
cvx0cdd,1,t3_3ognso,ScatteredPictures,"Clinton gets tossed a lot of canned questions that have tested well with her base, she answers well, and although her numbers will drop slightly, she'll maintain her wide lead.

Sanders gives more or less the same speech he's been giving for the past few months. His supporters overwhelming think he ""wins"" the debate, his numbers go up slightly since more people will be aware of him.

O'Malley gets far more talk time than he deserves, and his numbers go up slightly for the same reason as Sanders. Ditto for Webb.

Chafee will attempt to make himself stick out without saying something too confrontational, will fail, his numbers will stay the same or drop (they're almost nothing at the moment) and he will leave the race soon.",61,0,1444665189,1444716733
