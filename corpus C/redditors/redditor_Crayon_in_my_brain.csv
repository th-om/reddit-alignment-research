cvqoqjp,0,t1_cvqcy0g,Crayon_in_my_brain,Smoking is the perfect counter example to your argument. If is far cheaper to provide free counseling to anyone who wants to stop smoking than it is to treat cancer later. Similarly vaccines or properly targeted medications (ex. to lower high cholesterol) are likewise inexpensive compared to ER trips. Healthcare is complicated and nuanced. ,1,0,1444174114,1444716620
cvqc26t,0,t1_cvq9y2o,Crayon_in_my_brain,"> In the face of increasingly constrained resources, there is a realistic way of achieving better health results: conduct careful analysis to identify evidence based opportunities for more efficient delivery of health care — whether prevention or treatment — and then restructure the system to create incentives that encourage the appropriate delivery of efficient interventions.

To me the article seems to discusses whether it is worth screening for cancers in the elderly, which seems reasonable, but doesn't discuss whether it is worth treating easily preventable diseases in uninsured individuals who would not otherwise seek treatment. 

Yes, preventative is not necessarily the most cost effective method for every disease, but limited *and reasonable* preventative care for individuals who might not otherwise have any care is better in terms of both quality of life as well as cost.",1,0,1444154674,1444716620
cvpo0av,1,t3_3nn7cb,Crayon_in_my_brain,"Some good points here already but two other things that I don't believe were brought up yet:

1) You can't stop sick people from either moving to your state and/or figuring out what to do with out of state residents that are in your state. This would add significantly to the burden of individual state because there are very low barriers to limit an expensively sick person from moving to a state that will cover the entire cost of their health care. As an example: there are many people who moved/are moving to Colorado so they have access to medical marijuana. If someone were to be diagnosed with a caner that is expensive to treat cancer it would be in their best interest to move to a state that would take care of them.

2) Universal healthcare is initially expensive, but pays off dividends down the road. Preventative care costs more up front due to previously uninsured people gaining access to healthcare, but ultimately saves the system from having to pay expensive critical care later. This would also limit many states, especially smaller states, from being able to raise the funds necessary to implement the program. This burden would also likely vary state to state, depending on the current number of uninsured.",26,0,1444098613,1444716620
cvpjihs,0,t1_cvpe6v9,Crayon_in_my_brain,"I agree, price per guest would be a much better metric. In addition, the price of an ""average"" wedding has gone up significantly faster than the rate of inflation. So spending $1-5k in the 80's is a significantly different experience than spending $1-5k on a wedding today.

cvoul65,0,t1_cvotvd5,Crayon_in_my_brain,"> Assuming its platform saddle works the same way that Plesio and Bronto saddles do, it won't count the weight of any non-structure entities on top of it.

I think that the OP meant on the back of the Quetzal, not the talons. If this is what he meant, it would be similar to how brontos can carry a rex and wouldn't count against the weight. That being said, they devs have made it so that brontos can not effectively ride brontos so they could do the same for any creature that couldn't realistically ride along on the Quetzal.

cvguujm,0,t1_cvbbjux,Crayon_in_my_brain,"In addition to what everyone else said, it partially stems from a Bran dream prophesy: 

> He looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his father pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. There were shadows all around them. **One shadow was dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood.** - AGOT, Bran III

Obviously this does not confirm Cleganebowl, but it seems possible that there may be some unfinished business between UnGregor and the hound helm. My personal theory is that Brienne (now with facial scars) dons the Hound Helm, and Jaime (in the golden Kingsguard armor) will have a run-in with UnGregor.",2,0,1443448249,1444716620
