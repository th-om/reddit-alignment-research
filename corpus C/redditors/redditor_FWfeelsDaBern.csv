Raúl Grijalva is an Associate Member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.  Bernie is like many of us in that he probably needs some help seeing every issue that is out there.  Bernie is just the rare person in politics that will broaden his views while sticking to his overall positions on the issues.  ",1,0,1444568422,1444716895

* November 3, 2015 is Municipal Election day (in areas that have these elections this year).  

* May 3, 206 is Primary Day in Indiana (time to vote for Bernie).  

Now to get more involved, check if you have local elections this year.  Allen County has a very nice GIS with lots of election information (polling place, races, and usually sample ballots once we get closer).  

As for Bernie, many groups are collecting signatures to get him on the Ballot  for the Indiana Primary.  There is a specific form for this.  Please get in contact with your District or Local group if you want to Help other Bernie Supporters.  Facebook seems to be the best area to form groups but there is always email and other communication available.  This websiteis a good resource to finding those groups:
