In the years since I have found that very few adult vegans are like that. The problem is that young students are preachy and insufferable, not vegans. But I'd wager there are lots of people whose main exposure to vegans was people going through an irritating phase in college. ",136,0,1444391190,1444727202

cvs5img,0,t1_cvs4lv8,kamahaoma,"My understanding of provisional anonymity comes from the article: it ""will be withdrawn if the information turns out to be inaccurate."" In other words, if the journalist gets bad info they expose the source. I don't think it's reasonable to expect any government official would accept that bargain, even if they were telling the truth, for reasons I outlined in my initial comment. 

>Granting anonymity and publishing without thinking critically in this case was a sign of journalistic gullibility.

The unnamed officials in this case surely demanded their names not be published as a condition for 'leaking' the bad info. They did not lay it all out first and then ask pretty please don't use my name. The papers didn't have to publish it after they heard it, that was a sign of journalistic gullibility. But granting anonymity was a prerequisite to getting the information in the first place. 

If you're right and that really is just a semantic issue, then I think it's on the author's part since he spends most of the article talking about anonymity when it's not really about that.",0,0,1444277794,1444727202
cvs3ucq,0,t1_cvs1fc5,kamahaoma,"It's unlikely that powerful officials are going directly to the journalists with misinformation. They're probably using expendable intermediaries who may well believe the story they are telling.  Accountability and anonymity are mutually exclusive, you cannot hold someone accountable while letting them remain anonymous.

The other criteria I agree with, but they point not to anonymity as a problem but rather the gullibility or political motives of journalists. The title, though, is 'The Perils of Granting Anonymity to U.S. Officials,' not 'The Perils of Believing U.S. Officials' or 'The Perils of Journalistic Conflicts of Interest.' 

Ultimately, while I agree that there is a problem, the focus on anonymity in the article and the (IMO unfeasible) idea of 'provisional anonymity' made me feel like the author was mainly interested in having journalists out the liars or refuse to grant anonymity, rather than continue to gather everything and protect even shady confidences but be more circumspect in what they choose to publish.

Since you have to grant anonymity if you want them to talk to you, and we're unlikely to find out about US motives/procedures from anywhere other than an internal leak, that seems like 'turning off the faucet' to me.

cvrybwd,1,t3_3nvaba,kamahaoma,"Few potential sources are going to grant a career- or freedom- ending interview based on the promise of ""provisional anonymity"" based on how accurate the journalist perceives them to be in retrospect. 

After all, what if the source got bad info from above, and it turns out what they leaked was false even though they honestly believed it to be true? If I was a high-level official looking to leak bad info, I wouldn't go to the journalists myself - I'd tell the story to some lower-level official and have them pass it on. Or what if the cover-up is so thorough that it appears the source has lied even though they didn't? 

Anonymous sources have to stay. Yes, the government intentionally leaks misinformation, but it also unintentionally leaks real information, and many major injustices have been revealed that way. Clearly journalists must be more discerning, but turning off the faucet is not the way to go.",3,0,1444264840,1444727202

A traitor to a criminal organization is still a traitor. Many people agree that the government went too far, but think Snowden was still wrong for essentially snitching on his country to the international community. 

For others - myself included - whether his actions were right or wrong depends mostly on whether he had any other option that would have curbed the mass surveillance without exposing the US to international blowback.
