A little embryo has the same important characteristics as an egg or sperm: can't feel, can't sense, no consciousness, has never even *been* conscious, can't feel pain, etc.

Why value the embryo much more than an egg or sperm?  It's like being 99 miles from the finish line instead of 100. So what?",1,1,1444704525,1444717360

Interesting take on things.  In for a penny, in for a pound.  May as well kill as many as I can since I'm gonna get the same punishment!

> Which is kinda why liberals dont have a problem with abortion. It's not actually bad if it's not being done on a genocidal scale.

No thinking, feeling, sensing persons are harmed by abortion.  Same as not having sex in the first place, IMHO.  

Just because you nudged the ball and started it rolling down a hill doesn't mean you can't stop it from reaching the bottom.  Same as not nudging it in the first place.
