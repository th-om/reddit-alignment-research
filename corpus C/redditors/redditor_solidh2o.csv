I currently work in a small team of 6 that handless several hundred million in transactions a year, something that would have been completely impossible 10 years ago..

Things are changing, and at an alarming rate.  If you are not a highly motivated and  creative thinking person it will soon not matter the industry, humans need not apply.

This translates to an annual failure rate (AFR) of 0.88 percent, but their study found that AFRs in the field “typically exceed one percent, with two to four percent common and up to 13 percent observed in some systems”.

I remember a good while where western digital drives were 1 year and 3 months almost to a day before failing.  Not planned obsolescence, just some defect for a few years in the late 90's

I typically start to see some degradation in drives around the 3 year mark and at 5 years in home systems and in our large systems we are consistently changing drives out.  While most manufacturers claim 1 million hours, they always caveat at ""~1% failure annually"".  Some people just get lucky, others unlucky...

cvkxosl,0,t1_cvktl18,solidh2o,"I completely agree, but it's a drastic shift away from the current bid for electricity model that we currently have in most places in the us.  One challenge would be giving a value to the grid based on geographical location.  You can't say LA county because it's significantly more expensive to fix a transformer in downtown LA than it is in Compton / Lynwood, though they're relatively closely tied geographically. You could theoretically get into all kinds of issues about who pays for what maintenance, and a whole additional body of governance just to handle it ( knowing California bureaucrats I'll bet they salivate at the prospect actually).

cvkt7m1,1,t3_3n4rl2,solidh2o,"There's two pieces to consider here:  

1) affluent neighborhoods will convert to solar quicker than working and middle class neighborhoods.  As this transition progresses, more and more the cost of grid support will fall on the less affluent customers.  This could create serious issues.  There are ways to address, but the best way is to separate the billing so that grid support and energy purchase are completely separate -  rather than calling it a tax.

2) Further down the road, some neighborhoods may be completely net negative for the utilities ( my neighborhood is 70% solar - all new construction)  If locations like this don't pay for grid upkeep, there will be no incentive for the utilities to repair broken transformers and other maintenance of this type.  The best solution is to have this fully managed by public entities - and most likely result in some other form of taxation, which again would probably be regressive.  

I am all for solar but if you want to be on the grid you have to pay for it.  If not then fully unplug and get batteries to support your household in the evenings.

cv87tdp,0,t1_cv86yil,solidh2o,"exactly my thoughts!  I've lost count of the times I've discussed this with people.  I have a lot of hugely progressive friends, and I caution them not to get worked up into a frothy lather over current events  because of changes that are coming. 

Every time I say this, I get jaw drops "" but you're such a devout capitalist!"" they cry.  I'm more of a pragmatist.  I feel that Marx actually had a good prediction of the future, but only full automation and de-emphasis of capital/ production will allow his theories to be  realized.  I feel that trying to force socialistic or communistic schemes upon a general population will only lead to collapse or a totalitarian government.  Technology will be our salvation, not politics.  

Call me an optimist, but I really think post-scarcity is in our grasp in the next 50-100 years, and maybe immortality too.  That or global thermal nuclear war, but hey, here's hoping!
