cvs1oqd,1,t3_3nwt58,Elliptical_Tangent,"I have 3.

The first one I got was because of a discussion with friends over drinks.  I forget the entirety of the conversation, but I said, ""Strength comes from love,"" and that was controversial at the table.  It seemed like a slogan to live by to me, so I got it translated into Mandarin and tattooed from the base of my neck down between my shoulder blades.

Once you get your first tattoo, you realize it hurts, but not much, and the constant pain of it does something oddly pleasant to you.  You tune out to the pain, and go to this... other place.  I can't really describe it.  It's very Zen.

So then wanting more tattoos, a few years later, I decided to get an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other.  Most of this was due to the fact that I'm left-handed, and ""sinister"" literally translates to ""left-handed.""  The old custom of throwing a pinch over your left shoulder when you spilled salt comes from the superstition that the devil hung out around there.  Or something.

So I got a laughing devil whispering encouragement on my left shoulder, and a pleading angel on the right.

I'd really like to get 2 more tattoos on my hands on the triangle made by your wrist, base of thumb and base of index finger.  On the left hand, it would be the Eye of Horus and on the right The Golden Ratio.  Thing is, I don't want to be Tattoo Guy to people I meet, so I want to get them in white ink.  Problem is, I see a good bit of white ink work where the template ink has gotten into the tattoo, and I want it to be all white.  Haven't found an artist I trust to do it right.

If you're thinking of getting one, and you have an image you can't see getting tired of, go do it.  The pain is like irritating, not Ouch!  And there's that weird awesome place you get to go to...",6,0,1444270354,1444720261

cvqgilq,1,t3_3np9x6,Elliptical_Tangent,"People playing an rpg like each other enough to continue being part of the group.  The characters have to be assumed to feel likewise about each other.  If not the party falls apart.  Therefore, your job, as a player, is to find a personality for your character that's palatable to the other characters.  No lone wolves, no misanthropes, no sociopaths.

""That's what my character would do,"" is fine so long as the actions only impact that character.  If it's impacting the other characters, you're violating the other players' freedom to RP their characters the way they want.  They instead have to humor this asshat in the group, or have to attack/ostracize the asshat in the group; neither of which were the kind of character they'd imagined.

tl;dr: It's selfish, and violates other players' creativity in RPing their characters.",2,0,1444161159,1444720261

To me, he's in a group with Bill Burr, Doug Stanhope, and Patrice O'Neal (among others) where it's aggressively honest comedy.  For me, Jim isn't as funny as these others because he likes to reveal his personal grossness, which I don't think he makes funny, just known.  These other guys have all said something at one time or another that not only made me laugh, but expressed beliefs that I didn't know I had - not Norton.  But that's me.",3,0,1444020021,1444720261

Drugs?  Available.  Major cause of violence.

Alcohol (during Prohibition)?  Available.  The root source of organized crime in the US (which we're still shackled with thanks to drugs).

Adding guns to the list will not turn out well, history shows.  Add to that the fact that there are countries with higher gun ownership with lower violent crime, and countries with lower gun ownership with higher homicide rates, and I can't see how gun control fixes anything.",10,0,1443830255,1444720261
cvle794,0,t1_cvl46yk,Elliptical_Tangent,"> Or maybe, as Dorian and a few other mages say, is that blood magic is safe as long as you use your own blood.

That's my thinking.  I also believe that the blood mages are, on the whole, the kind to throw discretion to the wind, and wind up abominations for their recklessness.  Merrill had a very specific job in mind when she picked up blood magic, and although she's a little naive about some things, about magic she's got her head on straight.",5,0,1443761011,1444720261
