cviq83k,1,t3_3mu8qy,jo9008,I study Fire Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland. Every year we the engineering department lets the community in to show them what we're up to and our department puts on this demonstration on fire tornados.

cuvmt91,0,t1_cus2obc,jo9008,"Thank you very much for your response. It was very elucidating. Do you mind if I ask another question? From the Keynesian perspective, when injections of cash fail to move the IS-LM curve it is known as a liquidity trap. Do economist feel that's what we have been in the last few years? Also from the Keynesian perspective is it possible to 'bump' the economy back by creating temporary artificial aggregate demand? I believe this was the part of the tactic immediately after the recession when the government issued the stimulus packages. It seems to me in a time when banks and businesses have plenty of money on hand a fiscal stimulus would make more sense. Correct me if I am wrong but fiscal stimulus-> increase aggregate demand-> more hiring, spending and output by businesses? 

My idea to tax savings was similar in it's thinking in that if savings accounts were taxed (or something of similar effect) it would incentive businesses to spend that money instead of sit on it and wait for a better market. This influx of spending would increase aggregate demand and overall output. Does anything I'm saying make sense?",1,0,1441810759,1444718670
