cvu5z80,1,t3_3o3br7,BryanWheelock,"Multiple sets per exercise were associated with significantly
greater changes in muscle size than a single set per exercise
during a resistance exercise program. Specifically, hypertrophy-related
ESs were 40% greater with multiple sets
compared with single sets. This was true regardless of subject
training status or training program duration. There was
a trend for an increasing hypertrophic response to an
increasing number of sets. Thus, individuals interested in
achieving maximal hypertrophy should do a minimum of
2–3 sets per exercise. It is possible that 4–6 sets could give
an even greater response, but the small number of studies
incorporating volumes of $4 sets limits the statistical power
and the ability to form any definitive conclusions. If time is
a limiting factor, **then single sets can produce hypertrophy,
but improvements may not be optimal**. ",2,0,1444425991,1444719479

This is a excerpt from the most recent killer's Journal: On an interesting note, I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are,” the UCC killer-to-be wrote on Aug. 31.

He went on: “A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.
