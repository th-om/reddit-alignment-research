cvxc7lz,0,t1_cvu202r,ashstronge,Pretty much sums up my Stance on this too. I'm a nationalist and would really love to support the NI football team as they are a jurisdiction in Ireland - I just don't feel very welcome when many of the celebrations have Union jacks and songs about saving the queen ,1,0,1444682587,1444723359
cvrf85g,1,t3_3nqfnn,ashstronge,"Mathematically, probably not. In practise, if the Republicans lost Ohio & New Hampshire, it would be hard to see them winning Pennsylvania, Iowa or Nevada or a number or other states that would be neccesary to get them above 270 electoral votes.",1,0,1444235705,1444723359

cvgmxuv,0,t1_cvgap94,ashstronge,"Haha I didn't say the constitution was Unfair. However a judges job is not to decide what is fair. In a case where the text of the constitution clashes with what is fair, the judge should side with the constitution.

As the constitution is ingrained with 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness', sometimes there may be unfairness naturally rise up. That doesn't mean that it is unconstitutional. In many cases, Liberty will trump fairness due to the constitution.",2,0,1443419796,1444723359
cvgafsz,0,t1_cvg9qw8,ashstronge,The judiciary don't decide what is fair and what isn't. They decide what is constitutional and what isnt.,6,0,1443394231,1444723359
cv88rac,0,t1_cv7fowf,ashstronge,"Completely agree with this post. This has been my opinion for years- Hillary would have been the better choice in 2008 and Obama would have been a far better President in 2016-2024.

Unfortunately, the democratic (and general election) voters of 2008 went with hope for change over experience and I think the country has paid a price overall for that choice. I think Hillary Clinton would have been more effective and built a better relationship with congress, which would have less to (slightly) less gridlock and more effective legislation being passed.

Obama would have had 8 years to build relationships and experience as a senator (or even vice president) which would have been a great candidate in 2016, & more importantly, a more effective president.",1,0,1442780510,1444723359

The issue is not that your co-worker IS getting enough.",15,0,1442523080,1444723359
cv4pw8z,1,t3_3lap55,ashstronge,"Also women have increased from $22,800 in 1960 to nearly $40,000 now. Surely that is something to be celebrated.

I think Bernie Sanders looks at welath too relatively. If Bob has enough money to buy what he desires, then what difference does it make if his neightbour Paul earns more than him?

You either have enough money in your pocket or you don't- it is not subject to what your neighbours are earning. ",16,0,1442501442,1444723359
