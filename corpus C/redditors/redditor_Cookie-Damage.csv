cvt7fdt,0,t1_cvt78r7,Cookie-Damage,"I mean it is something to consider. Imagine you were a congressperson from a very liberal area. And say you were a blatant communist, or perhaps a total conservative Democrat; but of course, you want to further your career and are willing to modify your outward beliefs in order to keep the seat. Obviously, you'd adopt the political ideology and dialogue most dominant in your region.

Or perhaps, like Bernie, you're a liberal from an equally liberal state. You may not have to adjust your views, but you will have somewhat of an obligation to serve your constituency, which itself is a polite way of saying ""pandering"". The far left strike at Hillary for doing the same thing they idolize Bernie for doing. And who knows, Bernie might really be a Communist (obviously he probably isn't) and think the liberalism he espouses in order to gain traction is a bunch of malarkey, but of course, he's been pushing the fighting liberal image for decades, so he has to stick with it.",3,0,1444353939,1444726214
cvt75yb,0,t1_cvt6xv0,Cookie-Damage,"Personally, I would say I'm a mainstream liberal, and my views simply align with Hillary more. I also align with Biden as well, but I simply like Hillary more as well. Bernie Sanders is too liberal for me, and I really don't enjoy his fiery rhetoric that basically boils down to ""Free college! Bring down the banks!""

An interesting thing to note is how people always paint Sanders as the epitome of an honest, genuine politician, and demonize Clinton for being the opposite. How exactly does anyone know Bernie Sanders is being genuine? He's from a very liberal state, so of course he has to advocate for the same issues and positions as Vermont. In effect, he's been pandering to the liberal base of Vermont for decades so we've kinda gotten used to him. It doesn't really make him genuine. Drop him in North Carolina or Arkansas and see how liberal and populists he is then. If he wants to stay in Congress, I'll bet he moderates his views extremely quick.",5,0,1444353514,1444726214
cvt52bo,1,t3_3o1ehj,Cookie-Damage,"I like Hillary. And honestly, no one will want to participate if you phrase posts like ""Does ANYONE actually like her?"" honestly... It's r/politics level condescension. We also have no real way to tell whether or not you're being honest when you say no one you know likes her. For all I know, you could be lying. So many Bernie supports shove the same unverifiable, anecdotal evidence in our faces. ""Oh, I don't know ANYONE that likes her!!!"" yeah because you probably live a liberal or conservative area and probably only talk to people you know would affirm your anti-Hillary views. Its an old tactic that we here on r/politicaldiscussion are getting mighty tired of. This post is only 33% upvoted, so I think you get the message.

Furthermore, my best friends, my mother and grandmother, and my colleagues all love Hillary. That's my own personal evidence, and it can't be verified at all, to be honest, so its foolish of me to put it in any of my arguments.",14,0,1444350004,1444726214
