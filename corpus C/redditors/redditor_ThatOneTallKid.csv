Your selfish, individualist argument thoroughly discourages one of the American traits that led us to economic prominence: the willingness to take risks and bet on ourselves.",0,0,1443483386,1444722800

Seeing your name on so many billboards was surreal, since I've been a big fan since I read Looking for Alaska in 2010.

On your work with AFC Wimbledon, how is your relationship with the club's executives? What was their reaction when you said you wanted to sponsor them?  ",1,0,1439484540,1444722800
