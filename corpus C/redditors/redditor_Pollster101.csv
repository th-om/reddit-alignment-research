cvxm047,0,t1_cvxlf5l,Pollster101,">  The first article talks about a bill he was trying to pass that would have opened the fed up to audits. The president opposed him on this.

No, it talks about a provision added by Sanders that would have opened interest rates up to Congress. 

>The 2nd and 3rd follow about the same thread as each other, he wants the fed to be used to help the majority of Americans 

No, he wants the Fed to engage in policy. That is illegal, which is why he wants more Congressional control over policy. 

>although unless you're rich disagreeing seems to go against your own self interest, but to each their own

This is incredibly childish, and, honestly, idiotic. The Federal reserve is independent for a reason. Politicians can absolutely wreak havoc with their hands on monetary policy. Go look up Carter's appointment, and why it destroyed his presidency. 

You are either oblivious to the impact that a minor change in monetary policy, or you are just bending over backwards to defend Sanders at all costs. You intentionally misrepresented all of the articles posted. What good does that do for you? I've never understood why people would be so stuck in their ways that they refuse to consider new information. ",1,1,1444697897,1444716697

>Last-minute maneuvering in the Senate allowed the Federal Reserve to sidestep legislation that would have exposed its interest-rate decision-making to congressional auditors.

>Pressure from the Obama administration led Senate lawmakers to alter a provision pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) that was gaining momentum despite opposition from the Treasury and the Fed. It would have largely repealed a 32-year-old law that shields Fed monetary policy from congressional auditors.

In 2013, Sanders tried to push for a new Federal Reserve chairman who would use resources for political means.

>Specifically, Sanders said the Fed should demand that large banks use $2 trillion in excess reserves now squirreled away at the central bank to provide low-interest loans to small businesses to create millions of decent-paying jobs. 

And he is still pushing for the Fed to act as a jobs program, instead of a reserve bank.
