What war crimes?
Dont war crimes require some kind of intent or at least reckless disregard?

I watched the video and while knowing the outcome made it seem far worse, to the men performing the act there seemed to be no intent to harm innocents, indeed they showed restraint.

The US is acting badly in regard to whistleblowers, but the video wasnt a smoking gun to me.",1,0,1444693323,1444716246

And a former prosecutor turned college professor, but hey, go ahead and put your CCW permit holder ahead of that, TOOOOTAALLLY more qualified.

>You cannot go to the aid of another and be wrong. You have to be right, or you're going to jail. This is what I've been saying the whole fucking time. Your examples do not address that.

Again, this is not the law, it is not fact, it is nothing but the opinion of your CCW instructor.

>I cannot argue with an Internet Rambo how purposefully ignores what I'm saying though. 

I have directly countered what you are saying, you simply insist it with no more backing.

>You win dear Internet warrior. Thank fuck you don't want to carry.

Considering I have yet to encounter any such situation yet in my life its unlikely I would anyway.

Ah, so you think the letter of the law is not followed in the courts?

Shall I start posting examples?
I know of one kid in Montana who shot a friend knocking on his window, no charges.
Another is a man in Texas who shot a cop serving a no-knock warrant, no charges.
There is always Zimmerman, who followed a person who he thought was a robber, then killed him when he attacked, great big mess of a case that he won.

You are wrong, by both the letter of the law and the reality of the courts, the ONLY thing you have backing you is one concealed carry class teacher, who was wrong.

I'll tell you where he was right though, its best to be conservative in the use of force, because even those who are in the right, legally and morally, frequently have a hard fight with the hellish legal system we have. After that we simply differ in opinion, I would rather take a legal risk to prevent a unjustified physical injury than stand back, and let it happen. You say that makes me a rambo, I say it makes me a human being who cares for others, I say a rambo would roam the streets looking for trouble, I say a coward would ignore trouble that started next to them for fear of having to justify their actions in court.",1,0,1444595587,1444716246

1. I get to do pretty much whatever I want until I hurt someone else, meaning I dont have to read a long list of regulations (or hire someone to do that) to make sure I am not violating a law before I do that.

2. Because the more government ""help"" you have, by extension the more government control you have, freedom vs tyranny isnt binary, its a sliding scale, and rules put in place to help can also be used to harm.",1,0,1444590913,1444716246

>But if those companies took those revenues home to be reinvested towards the companies' infrastructure or hire more people, they wouldn't have been taxed anyway since they wouldn't be considered profits.

No, they are already profits from overseas, bringing them into the US to spend internally would require paying taxes on them.

>The most likely course of actions these corporations would take with these revenues that they would like them to be considered as profits is either to increase dividends to shareholders or to buyback shares from shareholders.

I have no intention of carrying concealed, why take the class?

Whut?
This makes no sense, why is it a problem to expect an officer of the law to be ruled by laws, to be a reasonable person who responds proportionally to the situation rather than escalates it dangerously and risks harming people unnecessarily?

>Growing up, my parents always tried to set an example to have self-control in the way I behaved. hey were quick to point out that **a bad situation is rarely only one party's responsibility.**

I have seen statements similar to this used to justify police abuse in the past, and the way it is used is amusing. Its always 'A bad situation is rarely one party's responsibility, which is why we shouldnt blame cops ever, its always the perps fault'

Its not always one persons fault, which is why I blame both, I do blame the cops more because they are adults trapping a kid who is already high on adrenaline, and because they were the ones who clearly perpetrated the abuse.

>If I had gotten into a fight and then was still acting all riled up and told the cops I still wanted to go after the other person (this is what the article said) 

Yes, the article mentioned that the police made this statement after a video was released of them abusing the kid.
You know, like they always do, blame everything on the perp.

>at which point they restrained me using excessive force, my parents would have found fault in my actions as much as they found fault with the officer.

In both sides a group of people believe that exercising a right results in the uneccesary death of innocents. The attacking group pretends to recognize the right and claims to just want ""regulation"" while in fact regulating the right to the point that its not possible to exercise for most people, a legal fabrication they willingly perpetrate to save the lives of innocents.
