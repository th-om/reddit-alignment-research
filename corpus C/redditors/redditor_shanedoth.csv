cvutb90,0,t1_cvuqj9n,shanedoth,"Acknowledging that the leaked information pertains to information that, *if true*, would be harmful to national security interests (almost always defined to protect ""sources and methods"" of intelligence collection), doesn't acknowledge that it's actually true or current.

If I tell the media that ""John Doe, the Deputy Minister of Finance at Equatorial Kundu, is a CIA informant,"" that's information that would certainly be classified, if true. But even if not true, it's probably harmful to U.S. interests to disseminate that false information (and it could be devastating to that individual).

So we could argue about whether certain things should be classified or not (or whether the government overclassifies things), but that's a totally separate discussion from whether the government has the power or an interest in suppressing the dissemination of information that purports to be classified information.

My own experience with hospitals, whether publicly owned or privately owned, whether for profit or non profit, or whether staffed by employees or contractors, is that they're just highly individualized with their own strengths and weaknesses, as far as the actual care goes.

For billing, though, all providers are universally awful, with vague descriptions of what you're paying for or what your insurance is paying for, late billing for shit that happened long ago, bills being sent to the wrong entity (so that you have to go through the hassle of fixing it with your insurer), etc.",1,0,1444251267,1444724820
cvrodbq,0,t1_cvrnco0,shanedoth,"Following the famous people *is* personal use for many people. The imbalance of followers trickles down to a bunch of less commercial uses. Maybe the cute girl gets a few more followers than she follows herself, and it works well for both sides of that. Maybe the lurker isn't interested in posting, but wants to consolidate different voices that he's interested in (jokes from comedians, announcements from traffic/weather reporting bots, news aggregators, etc.). It's a decent model for certain things. Just different from Facebook, which is in turn different from LinkedIn or Instagram.",7,0,1444248899,1444724820
cvrmwr5,0,t1_cvrg8te,shanedoth,"There are a few features that Twitter has that isn't easily ported to Facebook. One of the most important is the ability to follow someone *without them following you back*. Twitter sees it as two separate one-directional relationships, instead of a single bi-directional relationship.

This allows people to follow celebrities and other thought leaders without those popular people needing to create new ""fan"" pages. Instead, they use a normal twitter or Instagram account and let people follow them at will. It also gives instant feedback on a ""follow"" request because human approval isn't necessary. What this leads to is really popular accounts, some of which grow somewhat organically. There are many revenue models that can flow from that, that might not be available to entities like Facebook or LinkedIn or whatever.

And none of this is to say that the other model is better or anything, but just different. And differentiation is important for why two services can survive side by side.",22,0,1444246825,1444724820
