cvwnaao,1,t3_3od0jy,JustRuss79,"Does redditing count?  Between all the social media sights and emails I compose every day, I'm sure I hit 10k a day easy.

That is not the same as creative writing, but as long as you adhere to correct grammar and structure I think it counts.

The problem of course, is doing all of that ""normal"" writing every day and then coming home and doing another 1-10k of creative writing when you've already used up a large portion of your ""alloted"" words for the day.",1,0,1444626920,1444720596
cvwmx7r,1,t3_3obv8h,JustRuss79,"Personally:  If you are attractive, I will notice and try hard not to stare and wonder if you are doing it because you want me to look, or who you wan to look, or if you just like not wearing a bra, or if its laundry day and all your bras were dirty, or if you enjoy making everyone wonder all these things...  It is distracting, but welcome...though annoying sometimes when I'm trying to concentrate in a professional environment.

Personally: If you are not attractive (to me) then I'm going to think most of the things above, but be bothered in a bad way because I can't NOT notice and the fact I can't stop noticing makes me a little bit ill.

Other assholes who wolfwhistle and such.. yeah if you go without a bra you have to accept on some level you are ""inviting"" that kind of behavior by going without a bra..in the same way you would invite being hit by a car if you cross the street without looking even though it is your light and you are in the crosswalk.  You did nothing wrong but shit happens.

TLDR:  Distracting, sometimes good, sometimes bad, not your fault but it is ""polite"" to be respectful of how others feel around your boobs.  If you don't mind a little extra staring, then feel free..but please don't be offended that people like/dislike looking at your bra-less boobs..just accept the consequences.",1,0,1444625998,1444720596
cvwkkly,0,t1_cvwjn4s,JustRuss79,"Opponents of TPP called most of the bad stuff way back then, are you saying that just because they were right, does not mean they were right all along? 

Which is more plausible?  That the authors heard the protests and went ""hey thats a great idea!"" or that it was always shitty?",2,0,1444620859,1444720596
cvwkejy,1,t3_3odjgg,JustRuss79,"Your own blog is a good place to get known, you might get a guest writing gig on another site.

If you actually write a book or novel, you can use your now well known blog to advertise.

For ""publishing"" however, the easiest route is Amazon. You can use their tools to pulish an e-book then put the link on your blog. I'd stay away from using ""createspace"" to print any copies that you want to sell to book stores though,  go directly to lightning source instead or create your own publishing company (even just a shell company) to avoid having createspace listed in your book. Also make sure you have barcodes on any printed copies you want to sell to bookstores or they might laugh you out of any meeting.

Large book stores are actively rejecting anything to do with amazon if they find out about it because of the threat of online publishing, thus why you should stay away from using amazon directly through createspace.  They use lightning source to print their stuff anyway, so you can skip the middleman.",-1,0,1444620566,1444720596

Sure you can't drive a train into a building, but if there are 100's of passengers onboard you still have a security risk once it becomes popular (as hoped for)",3,0,1444620208,1444720596

cvvjr17,1,t3_3o7v90,JustRuss79,"Everybody is getting so in depth when it is much more simple than massive galactic formulas.

A fixed point, is anything you know to be true unless it can be explained as a lie later.

Knowing that Captain Jack was still alive centuries from now, means he cannot die. If he died, then time would unravel and create a paradox. (unless he somehow explains later that he was time jumping every time the doctor saw him...but the immortality has manifested itself already so would need an explanation for that too)

Same thing when Rose saved her dads life,  time unraveled and the universe stepped in to correct it by killing everything in the vicinity.

It is just that,  fixed points for a Time Lord are usually on a MUCH larger scale because they can travel from one end of time to the other. Much harder for the universe to clean up the mess.",1,0,1444539901,1444720596
