cvxhprf,0,t1_cvxf1t5,Nocturnal_submission,">We can all be forced to buy private insurace (our current system). 

This is not our current system. 

Also, I probably would prefer ""market based"" to ""free market"" as a term, because the price signals are the important part of the system, not necessarily the origin of the money. But when you condense everything to a ""nutshell"", you gloss over key details that affect how the system operates. And by conflating our current system with a free market/private system, you miss the opportunity to inject competition into a system without simply shutting out poor people. A market that is exclusionary is one that is missing an opportunity to deliver value. ",1,0,1444691017,1444719273
cvxemcb,0,t1_cvxef8b,Nocturnal_submission,">We agreed as a nation that everyone experiencing a medical emergency  can get care through the emergency room gets care. 

This is not good policy for a number of reasons, not least because it significantly increases the cost of care...

>If we want a free market system people who cant pay just die when they get a heart attack or have a stroke. This is an insanly cruel position, but it would be economically sound.

It would not be economically sound because we would be destroying valuable human capital. Also free market does not mean anarchy. Your caricature of the system does not mean that's what I or any center-right politician advocates today. ",1,0,1444686109,1444719273
cvxefhk,0,t1_cvxebu1,Nocturnal_submission,"Yes, well, I explained why the financial sector is especially sensitive to cost changes, hence why it would be destructive and therefore ""economically crazy"". You have not addressed that at all. ",1,0,1444685809,1444719273
cvxedrk,0,t1_cvxdk32,Nocturnal_submission,"It's deadweight loss, and if you apply it on both sides of the transaction and conduct multiple transactions per day, it adds up quickly. If any jurisdiction lacks this tax, thanks to the flexibility of the Internet the domicile of those trades can change overnight. Therefore the business will move. 

America's labor market situation is also vastly more complex than you make it out to be with that throwaway last statement. Improving financial regulation doesn't have to be destructive, although it certainly can be. Just like any other type of regulation.",1,0,1444685737,1444719273

cvxdmhc,0,t1_cvxbtbs,Nocturnal_submission,"We don't have a free market healthcare system in the US. We have private profits and public costs, which allows runaway price inflation to occur without signalling the distress to market participants. W/r/t Medicare for all, is that not just a single payer system? And if so, how does that help improve the quality and cost of the service provided?",1,0,1444684601,1444719273
cvxd0hz,0,t1_cvxcuqp,Nocturnal_submission,"Right, people in America would still need to use banks. So we would pay the tax. Traders etc can be domiciled internationally in a country that doesn't levy the tax and be at a distinct competitive advantage compared to us traders. If we require every transaction going through a us exchange to be taxed, within 5 years the nyse et al would be displaced by Asian competitors. ",0,0,1444683712,1444719273
cvxcdda,0,t1_cvxarcu,Nocturnal_submission,Let's let them do it first and see what happens. How can it produce such astronomical tax receipts if it doesn't cost the actors a lot of money?,2,0,1444682817,1444719273
cvxbwvf,0,t1_cvxb4q3,Nocturnal_submission,"That's a good point, although Internet and transportation are usually subsidized at a local level. That allows people to vote with their feet if they don't like the way the system and associated taxes work. Not sure how government subsidizes my cell phone but please inform me if I'm ignorant. Government food subsidies are predominantly for suppliers, but food stamps only cover a portion and are means tested so are less distortive than said universal programs. However, the patchwork of programs for people in poverty creates a plethora of problems on its own that are only tangentially related to the nationalizing of healthcare and education.",0,0,1444682172,1444719273
