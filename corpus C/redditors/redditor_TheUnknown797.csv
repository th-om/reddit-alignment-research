I personally feel that in the NDP was in the lead (federally) then people in the interior would swing NDP (Prince George-Cariboo comes to mind as one example) but if its between the Libs and Cons then the Cons WILL win....People here don't realize that Christy Clark and the BC Liberals are a different party from the federal liberals.",20,0,1444572453,1444726542

Compared to South Sudan and Sudan, Iraqi Kurdistan and Iraq, Somaliland and Somalia share both the same language (Somali) the same religion (Islam) and the same ethic group (Somali). The divisions mainly stem from tribal (Qabil) issues as Somaliland is mostly Issaq while Somalia contains many more tribes. Thus while Mogadishu sees multiple tribes fighting for power, Hargeisa only has the Issaq running the show leading to less infighting and more stability. Honestly the reasons for separation other than ""It's a stable part of Somalia"" aren't very strong compared to the other two examples where ethic and religious strife is/was common.
