But he also released documents detailing nsa intelligence collection activities against foreign countries that are far from unconstitutional - it's literally the nsa s job. That's where he fucked up.

There's no controversy that the documents made it to Hong Kong - that's where even Glenn Greenwald admits he got them http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-16/journalist-denies-claim-that-snowden-files-breached/6549268

The controversy is that Greenwald and snowden maintain none of the documents were taken by Chinese authorities. Which is fresh coming from a guy who was desperately trying to get asylum to China and released documents to a government controlled newspaper(south China morning post). And even if he didn't hand them over willingly, the Chinese would have made sure to get their hands on copies of them one way or another, especially on their own soil.

And you're right, that would make him a target for assasination, because he ignorantly, naively or at worst maliciously harmed US interests by even going to Hong Kong with documents like that.",1,0,1444173470,1444728668

That's a state secret. There is literally no reason for him to do that except that he doesn't have US interests at heart. 

> And again, there's no reason to believe Snowden had any files when he left the US. He gave them to journalists for a reason.

He had the files with him in China on laptops. That is undeniable. He has even said it on multiple occasions. He said he never gave it to the Chinese, but US operatives assumed from day 1 that the Chinese got their hands on them, because for the same  reason they wouldn't let such a valuable trove of evidence leave US soil without them getting access to it.
