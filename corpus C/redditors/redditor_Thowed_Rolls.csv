>""As much as the parents want this case to be about a 'gun,' it is, rather, a case about classroom disruption from a student who has had a long history of disruptive behavior,"" Nussbaum wrote. He asserted that the suspension came as a result of disciplinary problems the boy had, and not just because of what he did with the breakfast pastry. ""Had the student chewed his cereal bar into the shape of a cat and ran around the room, disrupting the classroom and making 'meow' cat sounds, the result would have been exactly the same.""",1,0,1443206863,1444724496
