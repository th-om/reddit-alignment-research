cvh3poz,1,t3_3mpaa8,urbanreason,"What's particularly interesting in the second half of the video is that in describing what they wanted to achieve with the creature design, they described almost the opposite of what they actually designed. 

Strong profile/sillouette, relatable, memorable, able to emote...

The creature in this movie really needed to grab you and stick with you in order to make the movie memorable, and it's the one thing that they really missed the mark on in the movie.",1,0,1443462571,1444722411
cvh2n8r,0,t1_cvgz9jn,urbanreason,"Agree in one sense but I definitely think it differs from the traditional definition of ""well-written character"".

Spielberg's characters are incredibly well-written, but specifically because they don't suffer a lot of unnecessary character development, but often come as fully realized characters with little development necessary. His characters are not themselves very complex, but contribute an often one-dimensional part to a multi-dimensional story. 

Take almost every character in Jurassic Park. Their character throughout the movie can often be summarized in a single sentence, and they even have a distinct visual palate. 

Modern movie-goers often mock these types of characters as being shallow and one-dimensional. They defy our lofty ideas of what defines a good character.

cvh1ybk,0,t1_cvgxboa,urbanreason,"100% with you on this. The design of the monster was the biggest missed opportunity in the movie and is one of the biggest reasons the movie became so unmemorable. 

J.J. Abrams does not have a good aesthetic for monster-design. He prefers amorphous, unrelatable, insect-like creatures with nothing recognizable or memorable about their appearance. 

When you look at good creature design, whether that's E.T. or Yoda or Godzilla, you can see pretty clearly what's wrong here. You can see Godzilla or E.T. once and remember what they looked like years later. You can see a J.J. creature a hundred times and still not remember what it looks like 5 minutes later. 

They provide nothing that we can connect with on any level. They only repel us.

cvcyg8p,1,t3_3m8gmv,urbanreason,"A behavioral expert could probably shed more light on this, but in my limited observation there tend to be many different types of barks that may come off as ""violent"" while not all of them actually are. 

I have a medium-large, fairly well-trained dog who does not typically bark at other dogs on walks who are barking at him (we trained him to ignore them). He will, however, snarl and/or return the bark on occasions where the bark is vicious or threatening. But those instances are in the minority.

My dog also has a greeting bark that is specific to people he knows (or thinks he knows from a distance) that to the untrained ear might sound ferocious.

But I think knowing what the bark means comes along with observing other cues such as posture, tail activity, display of teeth, pitch of the bark, pauses between barks or groups of barks, etc.",2,0,1443125513,1444722411

cvbhgs3,0,t1_cvb1jfv,urbanreason,"Like I said, we can debate the economic merits of a national $15 minimum wage: or in your case, say one word without context.

But the rationale of people don't support a higher minimum wage because a barista or fast-food worker will now make closer to their hourly rate, as though their job is so superior and a higher minimum wage is some kind of personal insult to them, who feel as though a warehouse or retail worker should always receive an inferior wage and live an inferior life-style to their own... I think at best it's a little petty and immature.",1,0,1443025360,1444722411
cvaweks,0,t1_cvakk5d,urbanreason,"I don't really understand where this question comes from. I make more than a few multiples of $15/hr, and if the minimum wage were raised to my hourly rate then I'd just have a lot more jobs to choose from. 

If I lost or got tired of my high-paying job and the minimum wage were close to my rate, I could take a lower-skilled job at starbucks and not fear I'd lose everything.

Now if a lot of people in my industry decided: ""well shit, why should I do this job I enjoy or got an education for when I could just punch the clock and stop thinking about work the second I leave?""... Then there would be a shortage of labor in my industry and the employers in my industry would be forced to pay more to keep us or attract us back.

Otherwise, I don't get the point in being jealous that a restaurant worker makes the same rate that I do. I just don't get it. 

We can debate the economic merits of a flat national $15 minimum wage... but as far as being upset that low-skilled jobs pay close to my rate, it just seems a little childish. 

Should McDonalds employees make my rate? Well I'm pretty sure McDonalds makes a hell of a lot more profit than the company I work for. If wages should be tied to anything, wages should be tied to the company's profit, not the perceived skill-level of the job. ",5,0,1442972545,1444722411
