cvxkb1t,1,t3_3ohhqd,plzsendhalp,"My puppy was the same way. First night I got him, I thought I'd made a terrible mistake.  He would NOT shut up.  Now he loves his crate.  He's totally at peace there.  When it's time for bed there's no fuss.  He goes into his crate on command, or even if he's just tired.  I'm lucky.  I didn't use any special training technique.  My friend's puppy, on he other hand, hates her crate and will not willingly enter it for any reason. 

I plan to get a second puppy soon and I hope Tuck is able to teach him that crates are safe, cool places, and daddy's always coming home soon with treats and love. Hopefully Tucks can save me the headache of separatin anxiety. ",2,0,1444695255,1444729246

I started it a while back and didn't get through the first chapter because of how cheesy it started.  I thought it was some slapstick nonsense.  The main character is named Hiro Protagonist and he's the world's greatest hacker/swordsman who delivers pizza for the mafia on the side.   Started it up again and fell in love.  It's so, so good.

Picadillo is what you make when you really love ropa vieja, but you don't feel like spending all day cooking.

cvu3i92,0,t1_cvu2l5f,plzsendhalp,"Tostones are SUPER easy.  You should make some.  I love them way, way more than the sweet plantains most restaurants in the US serve.  

Most grocery stores have plantains.  Buy a couple unripe ones.  Peel them and then slice them in 2.5 - 3 inch pieces.  

Pour some oil, I use olive, into a frying pain and lightly brown all sides.  Take them out of the pan and use a paper bag to flatten them.  Toss them back in the oil and cook until they're golden and crispy.  Salt liberally.  Mmm.  They also taste better homemade, in my opinion.  I'm not sure how restaurants get theirs, but there's usually a slightly off taste to them.  Like maybe they're kept frozen or something.  

I bet if you make them yourself they'll taste better than anything you've had at a restaurant--so long as you don't burn them.  They do burn easy.  ",4,0,1444422058,1444729246

My family fled to America shortly after Castro took power.  My grandmother has always cooked traditional Cuban dishes.  Old school, 50s and before recipes.  

Today, most Cuban restaurants serve a kind of Caribbean fusion.  Cuban with a little dash of Puerto Rican, Dominican, etc., etc.  And that's fine, but it's not what grandma makes.  I'm biased.  

That book is nothing but old school recipes, and they're great.  I'm a sucker for Cuban food.  Can't get enough of it.  I'm not generally picky eater, but man, when it comes to Cuban food I want it authentic or not at all.  

My girlfriend is like that with anything Italian.  ",12,0,1444419055,1444729246
cvu0zp0,0,t1_cvtt8xt,plzsendhalp,"Finding the right therapist is like finding the right girl (or guy).  

People don't realize that.  There has to be chemistry.  What works for me might not work for you.  You have to click with your therapist, and your therapist has to click with you.  When you find the right one it's fantastic.  You have someone trained to help who you can trust implicitly.  

Don't blame yourself.  Just keep looking.  If the next therapist doesn't work out don't do what I did and give up.  Keep looking.  It'd be like quitting women because there was no chemistry with the first girl you ever dated.
