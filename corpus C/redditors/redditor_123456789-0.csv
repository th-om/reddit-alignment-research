cvnlji2,0,t1_cvna4gj,123456789-0,You fail to reject the hypothesis that John Wayne's death was linked to testing of nuclear weapons. I don't think /u/oh_horsefeathers was trying to deal with multivariate analysis. Have fun in statistics though.,1,0,1443946035,1444723895
cvn10nf,1,t3_3nb0dx,123456789-0,"Hate to say it & I know this isn't the type of criticism you're looking for, but this is not a motivational statement. It reads more like an informal resume. I'd assume the navy already has access to your academic accomplishments & your statement leaves me wondering 'why the hell does an 18 year old have two associate degrees, let alone a bachelor's degree & what does that have to do with his desire to join the navy?' You should focus on some experience that showed you the navy was the right path, your long term aspirations with the navy, your goals, & your desire to become part of such a prestigious organization that can't be fulfilled by choosing some other path. You got to put a little more thought into it. Sorry.

Anyway, 'deconflict' is not a word, if that's what you're looking for.",1,0,1443901017,1444723895

cvm2ilg,1,t3_3n92t0,123456789-0,"Sounds like you already know what you want to get him. I wouldn't be very concerned about the element of surprise when gifting a dog or cat though. What's more important is finding an animal you both share a connection with. Let randomly taking him down to the animal shelter be the surprise, but it should take you at least a few visits until you find an animal that's just right. Not the most flashy option for gifting an animal on the day of your bf's birthday, but definitely the better choice in the long run.",2,0,1443816817,1444723895
