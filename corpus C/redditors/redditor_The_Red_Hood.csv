They're being released free this time around, but at least I am supporting the developers in that way. In addition to that we get the Fall of Reach movie - which the trailer looks great. The REQs will also be fun little bonuses to open up every few weeks.",1,0,1444422266,1444727872

cvspceu,0,t1_cvp6kcx,The_Red_Hood,"The ASU BME curriculum is interesting pretty generalized. I graduate with my bachelors in it this last year. You cover lots of different areas from biomechanics to bioelectronics, but the coursework alone will not get you a job in the medical device industry. Even the big names like Gore and Medtronic hire more specialized engineers like materials and electrical. Specializing in a particular part of BME is what you would want to do if you were to pursue it, but that is something you'll have to do on your own with lab experience, internships, tech electives, etc. Unfortunately there aren't any tech elective paths set up to help you choose that specialty.",2,0,1444325781,1444727872

cvlth8m,0,t1_cvlqggc,The_Red_Hood,"Oh that's right. As soon as I saw the ""3"" in your post I assumed it was the halo 3 trailer with the wraith barrage. You're referring to the trailer where Chief is wearing a cloak. That's makes sense. Thanks again!",1,0,1443803320,1444727872
