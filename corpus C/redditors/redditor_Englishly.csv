cvpd8bu,0,t1_cvpcka5,Englishly,"I was trying to give *myself* some reason to give it a chance. Wiseman was that reason. Though I fear that some of the jokes and reactions from people will not be dark enough for primetime national television. It also doesn't seem too far off from the premise to [Horns](https://youtu.be/3U7kcwiFsVM).

cvop8ej,1,t3_3njpty,Englishly,"I am not one to call for a coaches head before three seasons are up, and I don't think this article outright does that, but watching my other favorite team this weekend, the Gators, it became clear that good coaching is unmistakable. The woeful past two seasons for the Gators look more and more like Muschamp's inability to game plan and prepare the whole team for Saturday. Is there merit to this argument about Lovie not having the guys prepared, or does his gameplan just suck? What are your thoughts?",8,0,1444028313,1444721982
