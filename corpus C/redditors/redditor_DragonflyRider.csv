cvxs8x2,0,t1_cvxrf86,DragonflyRider,"10-year Sgt's turn into 15-year sgts turn into 20-year Sgts under your system. That makes a 38 year old Sgt. And what if they want to go for 30? Now you have a 48-year-old E5. I've never met a 40-year-old who could manage the physical demands of that kind of rank. I know they're out there, but I sure as fuck wouldn't want to serve under a 40-year old squad leader.  One of the expectations if you're infantry is that by the time you get to where your back isn't as strong as it once was, you have the rank to not have to do the heavy lifting like you once did. Besides' that's why they make warrant officers, right? If you're that good at your job go warrant and they let you stay in until your teeth fall out.

They tried your way once upon a time. It didn't work.  Hell, they had problems in Korea with guys who had only been out since WWII ended when they sucked them back in. Five years is a long time when you're expected to eat shit and sleep in shit and take shit.",1,0,1444707798,1444718406

cvxr3g2,0,t1_cvx2s8o,DragonflyRider,"If they let E5's stay in past ten years they would then have a corps full of 35 and 40 year old unpromotable E5's who aren't going to get promoted and know it and take it out on the Lance Corporals and won't do their jobs.  This way a new crop of corporals and sgts have at least some possibility of staying in and getting promoted. IT's Darwinian, but makes good sense in terms of needs of the service.

During Desert Storm the Guard had to throw out about 20% of its Officer and NCO corps because they were doing exactly that.  Let a guy stay in past his use by date and suddenly he's literally a fifty-year-old Staff Sgt. who's out of shape, not up to date on his MOS, and scared he's going to get blown away because he's out of his depth.  Would *you* really like to serve in combat under some 35-year-old can't get promoted Sgt who's been in fifteen years? ",3,0,1444705827,1444718406
cvwo8uk,0,t1_cvwn84v,DragonflyRider,"You're doing your job, hoping you won't get shot by accident. I was a combat photographer for ten years. You sort of put the consequences and everything but getting the right shot out of your head and focus on just doing your job.  It's not a reflex, you're looking for the best shot you can to describe the situation.  I once had a camera shot out of my hands as I held it to my face because I was so focused on getting the shot.

You can bet the shooter had to move a good distance towards this girl and move around her to get everything in frame. Great shots don't just happen, you have to move yourself to the right spot to get everything you want in it.  The photographer probably had a decent amount of time to see the guy shot, and the girl moving towards him, and recognized that this was going to be the shot that summed up both the government's irresponsibility and the public's outrage all in one fell swoop. You can bet he took more than one shot, too. I only got one or two keepers out of a roll of film back in the day.  Some suck, some are out of focus, some just don't quite make the cut. One or two jump out at you like this.",4,0,1444629559,1444718406

cvvyr0t,0,t1_cvvtn2i,DragonflyRider,"The box where the ammunition on an M1 (on the back of the turret) is stored is designed to blow outwards instead of just blowing up. It directs the force of the blast up and out instead of killing the crew.  Look at the video again and notice how the flames are on the back of the turret. On an older or Russian tank the falmes would also be coming out the commanders hatch. In this case no flame is coming out of the crew compartment at all, and the guy climbs out of a clean commander's hatch.  The missile hit the blowout box, but it worked correctly saving the crew's life.  There's a proper name for it but I misremember.",4,0,1444584351,1444718406

Believe who you want. I've seen the IR footage. CEV punches hole in wall, fire immediately starts where no BD people are. It may have been an accident, but the feds started that fire and spent millions of dollars to hide the fact.

And they also definitely shot the piss out of each other. At least one ATF agent was shot in the back by his partner.

I'm not saying the Branch Davidians didn't get what they wanted, but the feds fucked the goat. 

It also pissed a lot more people than Tim McVeigh off. Right wing loons have used it as a clear example of the threat the federal government poses for years. It helped start the fucking tea party for Christ's sake.

Poorly led, poorly executed, poorly explained.",1,0,1444506998,1444718406
