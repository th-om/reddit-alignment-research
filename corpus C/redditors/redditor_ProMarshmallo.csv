cvxwwfc,0,t1_cvxv1v9,ProMarshmallo,There is also the fact that the majority of players try to out run Leoric like morons instead of running to the side or through his march to avoid most of the hits. ,1,0,1444719652,1444731532

cvvm5k8,0,t1_cvvfofo,ProMarshmallo,The thing about Mosh Pit though is that not only can it cap all 5 players to be sniped but the mechanics of the stun makes Relentless and other such talents useless as it pulses a 0.25 second stun 20 times. It has that over things like Tyrael's judgement or Johanna's Blessed Shield. ,1,0,1444547179,1444731532

cvtemv3,0,t1_cvtamga,ProMarshmallo,That would be fine but if you wanted to buff RD I'd make it hit multiple targets so Zim since he's lacking any non-single target damage and has crappy wave clear potential. ,1,0,1444367322,1444731532
cvt9pyy,0,t1_cvt8pm0,ProMarshmallo,"DR doesn't need to be a gap closer because Kharazim already has Radiant Dash and two charges at that. If you want DR to stick to someone save a charge for characters that use an escape. It does a lot of damage with Iron Fists and making it near guaranteed damage with mobility and escape options as good as Kharazim would mean that he has incredibly low risk when using it. 

Talents like Blasing Reach at 16 would also effectively give DR a cooldown of 4 seconds. Add Fists of Fury at 13 and Kharazim does 1380 damage over 3 seconds. Nova's Triple Tap heroic at level 16 does 1923 damage and has a 100 second cool down. If Anub Arak were to take all 7 hits of SSS at level 16, he'd take 1715 damage on a 50 second cool down. These figures are of course are using the in-game value of Iron Fists. 

Lastly SSS is not a heroic designed for an assassin or damage dealing, its for offensive support. If you want damage heroics, find an assassin, specialist, or bruiser style warrior that you like. ",1,0,1444357601,1444731532
cvt7ojl,0,t1_cvt6xyz,ProMarshmallo,"Yes his default damage is 25 and at level 1 it only increases his damage over 3 attacks by 12.5, I fail to see why this is an argument in favour of your changes. It doesn't change the fact that he starts out-DPSing assassins. Its a factual statement of numbers but you've just pointed out that there is different scaling at levels 1 and 10.

You also can't completely rely on other teams needing CC to counter an off spec. Yes you can stun anyone out of anything that isn't invulnerable or unstoppable but because DR can be interrupted doesn't mean its damage should be buffed.  

SSS is designed as an offensive skill, the fact that it deals damage shows this. Its exactly like Force Wall on Tassadar or Sundering on Thrall, it can be used either offensively or defensively based on how it is used. There are very few skills that are purely offensively designed and the majority of heroics in this game can be used multi-purposely.  ",1,0,1444354340,1444731532
cvt5sh2,0,t1_cvsxrt3,ProMarshmallo, I hope your pants are fire retardant because that's a coat. ,11,0,1444351244,1444731532
cvt5o70,1,t3_3o1avy,ProMarshmallo,"Out of all the current supports in the game Kharazim probably has the most build variety; he can build for raw healing, mobility support, vision support, ability damage, and auto-attack damage. What you are proposing are massive buffs to his least effective build that goes against his core design, which is supporting the team not acting like an assassin. 

Kharazim has a great auto-attack when you consider his attack speed and changing it to a flat 50% bonus would boost his current with Iron Fists by 50%. Valla with full stacks of Hatred at level 10 does 218 damage a second; Kharazim currently does 210 damage a second with Iron Fists. With your change he would be doing 315 damage a second. Absolutely not, Kharazim should not be out damaging some of the best auto-attack assassins in the game.  

Iron Fists already does a very large amount of damage in conjunction with Deadly Reach. At level 10 Kharazim does 790-889 damage depending on if there are 2 crits 3 if he connects the full duration, that's about 30-40% of his own health (2470). For comparison, Nova's Snipe with Ambush Snipe and full stacks of Gethering Power deals 629 damage. Snipe also costs 15 more mana, requires stealth to reach that damage, and is a skill shot. You also want to make the full duration of Deadly Reach be a guarantee, that's ludicrous damage for a support. 

You've also completely missed the point of Seven-Sided Strike's design. SSS is a support heroic skill for a support character and the 7% on the highest health character is to help your team secure kills and not get them yourself. Percentage based damage is incredibly powerful and your change to SSS makes it impossible to mitigate or play around. ",1,0,1444351042,1444731532
