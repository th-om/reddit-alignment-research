 You either failed to correctly setup the billing address of the account or had a tenant before a full statement completed in which case you should have called to pay the balance the week after you had a tenant.

This was avoidable and it was only avoidable by actions on your own part.",-1,0,1444666159,1444722201

What can limit participation?

Knowledge of the event happening. I highly doubt anyone frequenting the sub would not know what was occurring.

Willingness to make calls. Some see making 10-15 calls to reach one person to try to convince them to change their party affiliation AND vote in the primary as an inefficient exercise due to the certainty of a non-100% success rate(they don't change or they change but don't vote).

Availability to make calls - many people are west coast and work meaning they could only make calls super early in the morning to people in the middle of their work-days.

Lag-time in process - Ok, someone is excited to begin calling and willing to do anything they can to help New Yorkers become aware of the registration deadline. They block out some time and sign-up to make calls. The email with participation link only comes after manual human interaction occurs. The person who has overcome all other hurdles to participate is now stuck waiting.  They receive their link the next day and make a mental note to block out some time to make calls ""sometime"" soon.  Life happens and the once aware, willing, able volunteer is no longer available.",3,0,1444426794,1444722201

With all the gamification happening. The lofty goal may have itself reduced the amount of calls made.  People like reaching reasonable goals and setting new ones, not to aggregate work for weeks towards a seemingly impossible number.

Someone somewhere should learn the lesson.",1,0,1444425611,1444722201
