cvxknxz,0,t1_cvxkhz8,Wowimo,"Yay, sometimes, as a couple we intentionally use the ""well my husband/wife doesn't want to"", which can be used sparingly to deflect. Sort of a ""it's not my fault"". As long as you are both on the same page with this approach, your wife sounds like she is comfortable with you laying down the law. That's great and it does relieve the pressure of her being the ""bad guy"" if she's not comfortable doing it herself. 

Sounds like you too worked it out!",1,0,1444695821,1444717692

cvwvd76,0,t1_cvwojsi,Wowimo,"What about this? Can you arrange for the kids to conveniently have sleepovers or playdates while the sister visits? That would at least limit their exposure to this wonderful example of humanity and hopefully somewhat limit the commentary.  Try planning as many things as you can out of the house for the kids, then you can mitigate the damage at home.

Also, stop coddling the sister so much. Always letting her choose where to go out to eat because you're afraid of her reaction? (If the kids are not around it would be easier to do this.) One night, going out to eat, just tell her you made reservations at XYZ place. Stick to your guns. You can say ""We really wanted to share this place with you. Sorry you don't feel like going there. We are going there whether you come or not. You are welcome to come or stay here, there is food in the fridge."" Then leave. Follow through. My guess is, if you two start growing a collective backbone against her behavior, she will reduce it in your presence.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with you as the husband taking the lead. You can play good cop/bad cop. You are bad cop in this scenario. You actually lay down the law against psycho sister. ""This is our house. In our house we don't yell at children/yell at each other/etc . ""My wife is the mother of our children and you need to respect her."" ""Don't speak like that to me or my wife."" ""Please lower your tone of voice, there are children here and it's not appropriate.""

My guess is, you are not the only ones disgusted by her behavior. I cannot believe everyone else around her thinks she is a little angel. It sounds like she needs someone to stand up to her and I'm confused as to why expecting an adult to act like an adult, and not a child would burn bridges? Do you really think if the rest of the family is as great as you say, that they would find fault with you for standing your ground?

There is a way to do this without creating a ton of drama. If you get into a situation with SIL/mother, you only discuss said situation with them directly. You do not engage other family members to try and get them on your side. If they bring something up, you say, ""well that's between us and let's talk about something else."" End of story. You don't owe other people an explanation for keeping peace and quiet in your own home. 

Ask yourself this - is she a person you want your children to engage with? If not, then why do you allow her around them? Do you want them to pick up behaviors from her? Or do you want them to learn that her needs are more important? 

I've never been a fan of keeping toxic people in your life. You seem to absolutely hate this woman and spend months dreading her visits. Your reasoning above doesn't excuse exposing your children to this. My husband's mother is a raging alcoholic and his father isn't much better. Do they ""love"" their son and grandkids? Sure, in their own fucked up way. But that doesn't mean we don't have serious boundaries and greatly limit their access. We barely see either because they are not examples I want my children to emulate.

One more idea - instead of having mom and SIL visit you, can you possibly visit them and stay in a hotel while you do? Would that meet the ""we need to see you requirement""? Get creative and grow that spine! This woman could live a hell of a long time - if she's 30, chances are good she's living until at least 60. Are you ready for 30 more years of this bullshit? 

Ps. In answer to your original question, yes, I have in-laws I cannot fucking stand. They have screwed my husband over and disappointed him his whole life. He's more forgiving than I am because he desperately wants a relationship, any relationship at all, with his parents. However, the longer we are together, the more unhealthy he realizes both are and he has limited his contact. I told him early on in our relationship, that he can have any type of relationship he wants with them, but me and our children are not going to put up with that shit. Kids don't need to see their grandmother falling down drunk or their grandfather throwing an adult temper tantrum. 

Do I think that's sad? Hell yes. However, I remember, they are the adults. They are the ones choosing to drink/act out/be crazy. They are choosing their own behaviors over their grandchildren. I didn't make that choice, they did.",1,0,1444655820,1444717692

cvwimhs,1,t3_3odm1i,Wowimo,"Why are you letting these people into your home? Twice a year at that! It does not sound like there is any redeeming value to their visits. Your wife dealing with your mother doesn't sound like a reason to be prisoner in your own home.

Why don't you just tell them no? Pretend to be gone? Go stay at a hotel yourself? You and your wife are adults. It's your home. Your job is to live your life and protect your kids from this type of environment. This is not good for you, your wife, or your children! 

Walking on eggshells until they die is not the way to resolve this. The way to resolve this is to, pardon my french, ""grow a pair"" and get that horrible woman out of your house.",1,0,1444617371,1444717692
