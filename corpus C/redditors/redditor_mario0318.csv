Sure they hold an influence over the direction of a company, but that doesn't mean sacking them would sink the company and ""wreck"" our economy. Their actions did far more damage than jailing them would ever do. It shows an example to jail them, and the company would do just fine finding someone else.

You're also making it sound like we would be jailing thousands of them. Jailing just 5 or 10 isn't going to wreck such a diverse economy. We might dip as confidence is lost in these large corporations but that's necessary. They should be broken up anyway so as to avoid such large disruptions in the future.",3,0,1444186726,1444727948
