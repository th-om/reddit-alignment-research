cvchhcv,0,t1_cvbk8x1,lalaland1125,"I don't think you quite understand all of the pro higher minimum wage arguments. The basic idea is that it takes a certain amount of money in order for families and individuals to survive in society.

Now, there are two ways to provide that money. One way is through welfare and government spending. The other is by forcing employers to pay the real cost of their workers through minimum wage laws. Right now we are sort of using a mix of both approaches. Many of the people on minimum wage require governmental assistance.

The main reason I advocate for a higher minimum wage is to move working people off governmental assistance. I do not want the government to subsidize industries that can't pay their workers enough to live. 

That is the reason I don't advocate for ""20, or 50, or 100"".",2,0,1443099175,1444727057

If someone believes something as crazy as a young Earth creationism, which is based off pretty much nothing, what else could they possibly believe? I don't want someone in control of nukes who clearly lacks the ability to see reality from fiction.

Now, if there was some evidence that homosexuality actually caused moral and/or psychological harm, I would also be forced to critique candidates for being homosexual. However, all evidence seems to indicate that homosexuality is a normal part of the human experience and offers no advantages or disadvantages to heterosexuality. I am always open to new opinions though. Feel free to prove me wrong.",1,0,1442689964,1444727057
