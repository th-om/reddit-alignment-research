cvrgrwi,0,t1_cvrfvqa,Angel3,"According to the box, i think 6? But the pharmacist gave us the correct dosages for our 2 1/2 year old because he had some sort of allergic reaction and had hives.  Word of warning though, benadryl has the opposite effect on toddlers.  Ours was bouncing off the walls from it. Sucks, because I really could have used a nice nap.",2,0,1444237971,1444719939

cvrc959,0,t1_cvrbq28,Angel3,That's not true.  I was a MA in a doctor's office and administered vaccines regularly.  We did all sorts of IM and subq shots. Just didn't do any IV drugs. ,11,0,1444231286,1444719939

Then a slice of bologna for the rest of the little circles. Its a little bit more than I'd use for a cheese sandwich.",1,0,1444179313,1444719939

cvqkycf,0,t1_cvqfah4,Angel3,"Honestly, I think that's probably the main issue. You talk to the husband about your day at the park and mention Sue, Sally, and Mary everything's fine, but you talk about Steve, Bill, and John and suddenly there's an issue.  Hell, my husband is used to the fact that most of my friends are guys and he is probably the least jealous guy I know, but if I'm out making new male friends while he's at work busting his butt so we can afford for me to stay home with the kid I think he'd probably get a little ill about it.  It isn't fair, but it is what it is.  Only thing I can recommend is maybe try to hit the park on the weekends with your wife, maybe she could help break the ice with some of the wives and maybe some of these women would be more willing to engage with you while their husbands are around, which is also more likely on weekends.",3,0,1444167735,1444719939

cvmp9al,1,t3_3nc2e5,Angel3,"> I find the claims that the US problem with mass shootings to be one based in deficiencies in mental health care to be somewhat lacking; if every country has roughly the same number of mentally disturbed people per capita, shouldn't they have the same number of mass killings as the US? 



It isn't a matter of per capita mentally ill, it a matter of access to treatment to the mentally ill.  In countries with universal health care people with mental illnesses can seek treatment, whereas in the US even if you have health insurance psychiatric care is not necessarily covered nor is medication so receiving proper treatment can be extremely difficult.  We desperately need to fix the healthcare system in the US.",36,0,1443878492,1444719939
