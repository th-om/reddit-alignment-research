Ah Tabai. .. seemed cool but also very calculating, i get a similar vibe with Evie.",3,0,1444507133,1444719174

Yeah older Ezio would be an absolute threat,  one i could see Connor easily underestimating. But yes, an assassin trained Native is a force to be reckoned with! Ah Tabai comes to mind.",3,0,1444500194,1444719174

cvuy8hl,0,t1_cvuts9j,Wildfire9,Though i feel even Connor is a more effective silent killer after honing his skill hunting wild game and learning to fly through the trees.  He is a wolf.  Ezios cool and all and maybe I'm an AC3 purist but i just see Connor as a better killer.  Now Ezio-Revelations version vs. Connor would be a better fight.  I could see that hook blade catching Connor off guard.,6,0,1444499122,1444719174
