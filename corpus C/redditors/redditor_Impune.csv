cvx2nmj,0,t1_cvwwuig,Impune,"I thought the same thing -- others have donated larger sums (to Poly even) in the past and not seen a name change. But I guess that depends on the relationship between the donor and the school; if it was someone who cherished the Poly name donating $200 million, they might not necessarily want the name to change. But I digress.

I haven't seen the contract, but I'm *guessing* this is a first step to building a long-term development relationship with these donors. NYU named a school after Tisch, and they came back time and time again to donate (and now they have the Tisch Hall [Stern] and the Tisch Center [SPS] and even a Tisch Lobby [in the SPS building]).

My guess is this $100 million isn't just for the name change to Poly; it's for the name change on the understanding that there will be a few more buildings/archways/random rooms named after Tandor with subsequent donations made for each one.",2,0,1444668826,1444729334

People dressed up as 49ers (overalls, dirt smudged on their cheeks, with signs that read ""Gold Digger"") and some others had Kanye inspired facial hair drawn on their chin. They were all accused of wearing black face and are now being ""investigated"" by the university. ",1,0,1444656334,1444729334
