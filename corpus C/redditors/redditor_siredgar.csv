""Du_mich_auch pegged it (http://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/1q66po/why_do_people_talk_with_fascination_about_genghis/cd9lh0y), but I would add this as well:

Fear of recurrence. There is no organized (or even disorganized that I'm aware of) effort at reviving the armies of Ghengis Khan. There is no Neo-Khan party.

Neo-Nazis are a reality however. Crimes and violence committed by self-professed Nazi admirers and/or Neo-Nazis are a real thing. It may be a small movement, but it's an undeniable movement. Swastikas still get painted on Jewish cemeteries and synagogues.

Genghis Khan is history. Nazi's are still now, even half a century later.

When you're already in a hole, stop digging. Club up some money to put this woman up in a hotel, and tell your wife the truth. 

Or start looking for marriage counsellors. ",4,0,1443495331,1444723295

- Prostitution to protect customers from STDs.
- Suicide to make sure someone is in a rational state of mind when making this decision.
- Selling body parts to make sure poor people or those who aren't capable of giving informed consent aren't being coerced.
- Drugs - Probably the one I'm least concerned about regulating though I'd be open for a good argument as to why it should be.",0,0,1443316298,1444723295

I don't agree with the thoughts posted so far that the clients are guilty so get whatever you can for them. Presumption of innocence until proven guilty. 

In addition to the overworked points posted previously, I bet a big part of it is that the public defender's client has something to lose if the case goes against them (liberty, fines, etc). The DA doesn't really have anything significant to lose if a case goes against them that I'm aware of. 

Stack those two pieces (overworked, and the costs of losing to your client are significant), and plea bargains make a lot of sense.",0,0,1442849636,1444723295
