cuqrx4b,1,t3_3jnfiz,nikovich,"I see where you're coming from, but I'm not sure I agree. Jeb's big strength starting out was that he could attract monopolize the GOP field before anyone else could line up voters or donors. He got the donors, but as an article this week in Slate describes, they might have just been premature. I mean he's flubbed the big question he was obviously going to get (Iraq). He gave a milquetoast showing in the debate. He just seems like someone who hasn't run for office in a while. So maybe the donors made a mistake, and now Jeb could just spoil the GOP's ability to coalesce around a more popular candidate.",1,0,1441394984,1444731418
cuqgtna,0,t1_cuqevie,nikovich,"I think in a typical election you're totally right. Cruz and Huckabee are going for the Reagan strategy to win as a conservative buoyed by the enthusiasm of the GOP base. But they don't have the celebrity status Reagan did (Trump does), and their opponent isn't Carter in a bad economy, and the ""silent majority"" no longer exists demographically. So it's an optimistic strategy, but it could work against a weak democratic candidate. But I am frankly surprised that Rubio would do this, as he's aiming for the establishment lane.",11,0,1441378407,1444731418
cuqad5n,1,t3_3jlowr,nikovich,"I think the GOP establishment is eager to avoid making it an issue, as polls show a majority of Americans support gay marriage. But any GOP primary candidate whose strategy relies on rallying the Evangelical Christian vote to their flag is eager to make it an issue. This is the kind of thing that could get the GOP base riled up to caucus for them in Iowa.",118,0,1441363305,1444731418

cup62f4,0,t1_cup16wg,nikovich,"Not super keen on that myself. Worker and state-run industries tend to create the same environmental problems as corporations. For example, take coal miners - across the world they oppose regulations decreasing fossil fuel emissions. The mining unions in eastern Europe constantly demand increased coal production. In Czech Republic, the hunting and fishing unions under communism turned the country's forests and lakes into farms for their prey. Indeed, communist countries are [plagued](http://articles.latimes.com/1994-06-21/news/wr-6835_1_water-treatment) with [environmental](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-13/china-air-pollution-kills-4-000-people-a-day-researchers) [disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster).
