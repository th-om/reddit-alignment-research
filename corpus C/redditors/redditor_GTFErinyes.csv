I can't see the markings, but the paint scheme suggests its not a NASA bird. Instead, it's likely an F-15 from the CA Air National Guard unit out of Fresno, especially if this was taken over Sacramento",1,0,1444708235,1444719635
cvxsg1c,0,t1_cvxm8n1,GTFErinyes,"> meaning Fighter and Assault aircraft.

Your post is correct, but I'm going to be *that guy* when I say that the A actually stands for Attack

It was designated F/A-18 since it was one of the first aircraft designed from the ground up to be capable of doing both fighter and attack roles with its flight computers being able to switch from air-to-air to air-to-ground modes seamlessly

>NASA used to use T-38s for the same purpose

NASA still uses the T-38 - NASA gives its pilot-qualified astronauts T-38s to take around flying to stay current. Last I recall, it was 10-15 flight hours per month

cvxs2ri,1,t3_3og9fu,GTFErinyes,"Much better color schemes - did you intend to put the destroyer icons on the coast they are home ported to?

Also what source did you use for classifying a ship as a destroyer? Each nation has different criteria for naming a ship a destroyer, and an American Arleigh-Burke class destroyer is going to be significantly different from a Argentinian destroyer for instance

Sad to see how few destroyers the UK's Royal Navy has now given the RN's prestigious history - just 6 Type 45's for their entire navy.

Exactly. They were designed in the 70s in case of a war with the Soviets and the Atlantic was swarming with Soviet attack subs

With the end of the Cold War, and the diminished sub threat (as well as the increased capabilities of our destroyers with the Arleigh Burke class), they ended up being an under-armed ship for a navy focused primarily on open ocean ops",1,0,1444707333,1444719635

That's Space Shuttle Endeavour being carried by the modified NASA Boeing 747 during its flight over Los Angeles before landing at LAX

The stadium at the forefront is the Coliseum of Los Angeles, which hosted both the 1932 and 1984 Olympics

cvxqtc5,0,t1_cvximr0,GTFErinyes,"> What gets me is how close the escort is flying. I would have thought it was needlessly risky to fly that close.

Military formation flying is far closer than that - a few feet of separation when necessary, such as flying through clouds together",1,1,1444705377,1444719635
