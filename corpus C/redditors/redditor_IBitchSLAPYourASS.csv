cvwdg64,1,t3_3odz27,IBitchSLAPYourASS,We can win. I know we can. I just hope it's a blow out. We need to get our offense clicking and going. ,2,0,1444607931,1444723656

cvw6ia6,0,t1_cvw5uhj,IBitchSLAPYourASS,Glad I wasn't the only one to notice. I think they burned a TO and then they booed right?,1,0,1444596115,1444723656
cvw6gbe,0,t1_cvw60aq,IBitchSLAPYourASS,My exact thoughts. We lost like this to GB this year too(In spite of the 17 lead today). Took the lead and our offense didn't step up and Rodgers got another chance and then another chance and boom our lead is gone. ,5,0,1444596034,1444723656
cvw6b3d,1,t3_3odalx,IBitchSLAPYourASS,What no one is talking about is how the Bengals scored 2 TDs on the same play twice in a row. Seriously what the hell. I saw i coming from the formation,3,0,1444595813,1444723656

cvw27re,0,t1_cvw1za0,IBitchSLAPYourASS,It was holding though. He had his arms all around Irvin. I'll admit any call withholding my homerism but that call WAS holding. I'll admit holding calls go uncalled all the time and this call could have gone unnoticed and lots of people would think nothing of it. but it was called and there's nothing else to it.,0,0,1444589769,1444723656
