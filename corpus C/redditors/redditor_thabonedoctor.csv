cvvz89h,1,t3_3ob2am,thabonedoctor,So what does that translate to in terms of number of bibles American Evangelicals should send over to help the cause? Should we send 5 million prayers or 10 million? Which televangelist can I donate seed money to for this???,-1,0,1444585117,1444722466
cvpwz7s,1,t3_3noois,thabonedoctor,"So... If I didn't do the Darkblade nightfall the first week, will I get a Calcified Fragment from this? I heard it's from a nightfall on the dreadnought, and I've heard it's from any nightfall... Which can't be true because I've beaten the NF this week and last week and don't have that CF.

I'm at 44 Fragments so I sincerely hope I don't need this one haha",1,0,1444122877,1444722466

Honesty I think Hawkmoon and TLW are the odd men out, hand cannons are too underpowered now. Pulses and Autos are top tier. Lots of fantastic legendary primaries around now too so I'd bet on lots of Invectives being paired with them. 

I'm interested to see if Truth or Bolt Caster is more popular. Glad I'll have both ready. Monte Carlo is extremely underrated as well.

The bigger question is what the hell do non-Titans do against teams of 3 sunbreakers... It's too easy for Sunbreakers to clean up entire teams in 3v3 with the health regen perk. ",1,0,1444120894,1444722466

cvkugap,1,t3_3n32yj,thabonedoctor,"If KSA and Russia get into a punching match the disaster of the ME will get so much worse. 

Consider the possible outcomes if that happens:

Saudi gets wrecked, Russia and US now engaged in a proxy war in KSA. World feels bad for KSA because of more U.S.-Russia meddling, Wahabbism spreads more

This alleged Saudi coup in planning happens the moment the regime pushes Russia back, new leaders aren't as crazy, war is prevented. 

Or, new leaders are more crazy, they bomb Russia, Russia says ""oh look lots of Ruskies in Mecca aren't there? Time for annex, don't you agree Crimea?""

Entire Arab world says enough is enough, finally gets collective heads out of asses and fights for their sovereignty. Both Russia and ISIS back down, ME enters period of lasting peace. 

The breakdown will end up with the GCC, and a very unwilling US, fighting Russia, Assad, And Iran. That is a truly awful outcome. If KSA is going to shed their brutal theocracy, it cannot be triggered by Russia, by the U.S., by Israel or any western nation. This MUST happen by an organic breakdown of the regime (or this alleged coup in planning), economic pressure to reform in the manner of Dubai, or (worst case) civil war, likely incited by ISIS. 

Whatever these horrid games, real or not, that some ME leaders are playing by being far too friendly with ISIS, they will come back to bite those who participate. 

If Russia engages in any actual attacking of the nation of Saudi Arabia, the entire region will get so much worse. ",2,0,1443727706,1444722466
