That's a choice to commit crimes.

>people would starve

When has anyone ever starved to death in the United States? That's some South Sudan shit. Never happens in the first world. Nobody was starving before food stamps. They won't when they're taken away.

>Violence would skyrocket.

Also a choice. We have prisons. I'll even throw in ending the drug war to free up the space.

A LOT of people simply don't give anything to their politician of choice and vastly more people don't even engage in having an opinion at all. If each of these 120 million gave like 20 bucks, that half figure would be a lot less.",-2,0,1444621741,1444717480
