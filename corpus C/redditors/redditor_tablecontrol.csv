Many Japanese and German cars still look good after 7 or 8 years.  I can't say the same about most American cars",3,0,1444584373,1444718302
cvvwv2s,0,t1_cvuxvt4,tablecontrol,"I think the problem is the CPU usage.. it gets pegged at 99 - 100% for long stretches at a time.

I have an AMD Phenom II 6 core processor.

I was finally able to get into the game and play. the menus would peg CPU @ 100% for awhile, then be able to play.. but many times ingame the same thing would happen.

I just go so frustrated that I went back to BF4.",1,0,1444581077,1444718302
