cvtyctd,0,t1_cvtxuua,norablindsided,Just finished the episode you were talking about two days ago so that's why I remembered. First time watching TNG,3,0,1444414338,1444725978
cvtxrtx,0,t1_cvtmsvg,norablindsided,That was a different episode. There wasn't a junk yard in that one. The two part one you're thinking of is Unification where they played possum in that ship yard for figuring out why the Tripoli was missing.,7,0,1444413464,1444725978

I use it at night when doing development at night as it's easier on the eyes. Another thing to do is try to use a dark theme for things as much as possible. Kinda look into what developers are doing as these are people who have been sitting in front of a computer reading for extremely long hours for years. They know some ways to prevent eye strain",2,0,1444306222,1444725978
cvranw2,0,t1_cvr9vqp,norablindsided,Seriously every headline is linkbait. I wonder how many people will actually use this due to Reddit users being very vocal about disliking those types of titles.,4,0,1444228771,1444725978
cvjnvd8,1,t3_3mynod,norablindsided,"I'd highly recommend looking into Indian food.  Curry keeps well and all you'd have to do is get some rice and veggies and some naan bread and you have a meal.

I'm not huge into vegetarian food, but if I had to go vegetarian I'd probably just eat nothing but Indian food.",17,0,1443642386,1444725978
cvgvae1,0,t1_cvftl05,norablindsided,"I always felt that I the benefit of having the color coding was that you could run up to any member with a yellow shirt and assume some knowledge on how to work ship systems, while a scientist may not have such knowledge. I imagine that to be very useful in war time when you can immediately pick up someone's skill sets visually.",1,0,1443449158,1444725978
cva3rou,0,t1_cva2d95,norablindsided,"Interesting I'll have to look into this more. I did see one case [Monsanto v Schmeiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc_v_Schmeiser#Patent_rights_versus_property_rights).

But that case seems kinda iffy. Apparently over 95% of his crops were round-up ready crops, and that doesn't happen with just having seeds naturally into your field. Those had to have been planted.

I do think it is an issue that the possibility of a suit does exist. Could it be possible that a suit could be settled out of court?",1,0,1442925566,1444725978

cv9vb1g,0,t1_cv9d05d,norablindsided,"GMO use is great when it adds nutrients to foods. However, lately it has been used by seed manufactures as a way of hurting farmers. Monsanto specifically has a large legal division to simply make sure farmers aren't using their seeds. Its a big issue when a farmer is next to someone using round up ready seeds and the seeds blow into their field. They then get sued by Monsanto for having their seeds in their field.

GMO patents are the biggest problem, and while we do know that most GMO foods are perfectly safe for consumption what we don't really know are the long term environment impacts with certain GMO seeds.

While we would like to think that GMO is for more nutrition most of the time its for round up ready crops.",0,0,1442895514,1444725978
cuvqgk3,0,t1_cuvku8m,norablindsided,Was that an actual prop though? I know that some of the props they showed like the lightsaber was a 3d printed replica. Could it be that this was just a cheaper replica fabric than the actual movie prop?,14,0,1441816340,1444725978
