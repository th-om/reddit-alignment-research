I hate how R v W is written because ""when does life begin?"" Became the issue. No!! I'm in that third camp. 

Who cares? Some foreign body has taken up residence in my body and wants to grow in me? Fuck that, like any other medical procedure to correct an unwanted/unneccessary health condition.

I'm 100% behind someone who finds abortion abhorrent, mad respect for their opinion, truly.  They can decide what's best for their family, not the government, and certainly not me. 

I freely admit to being part of the problem in this discussion, though. For me, it's an issue of health, and personal autonomy.  The government does not get to force me to allow my body to be occupied.  What the fuck? I can't wrap my head around any of the ""when does life begin? No one ever wants abortion! It's a hard choice. It's a life"" back and forth.   I can't begin to care. It's a medical condition and if it's fucking up my life and health, I would like it stopped please. And thank you, science for pulling us out of the dark ages. I would like to take advantage of you to better my life, please.

I rotted my teeth from being a drunk and I was able to get a medical procedure to correct the issue. 

Women have *died* for what is essentially a couple hours outpatient procedure and some discomfort/pain to heal physically.  

For me, it's a deal breaker and it's a personal failing of mine that I just can't debate it rationally, because this is my *health* and my rights as an autonomous citizen to control it without government interference.  I won't budge, not ever.  You'll take my reproductive rights from my cold, dead hands.

Oh and by the way, Middle-class means you can weather these types of issues monetarily.  We could not, even insured.  We're two college educated people with decent work histories who have spent well over 150k on therapies etc for our child, and not to mention programs he needs- which tripled his college costs, btw. 

Maybe I should have bought a timeshare in a spa for my anxiety issues instead and just let my kid stay not potty trained, unable to communicate effectively, screaming in pain all day long.  ",1,0,1444688813,1444729657
