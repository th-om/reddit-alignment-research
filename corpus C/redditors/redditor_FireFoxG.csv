The i8 is one of 2 cars on the consumer market that is in competition with Telsa right now. the is the i8, GM ELR and Telsa... Everything else is either WAY WAY outside the 100-200g range, or competes with a Prius in the sub 40g range.

The ELR only has 233hp, so that is out, leaving the i8 the only competitor in the market. So ya, you are wrong.

cvxrwr4,1,t3_3oidvo,FireFoxG,"Nic Bostrom's take on it is the most compelling argument for it.

Based purely on the odds... It is so overwhelmingly likely that we are in a simulation... that it renders the probability that this is our first time through the looking glass at near zero.

The argument goes... Imagine you are watching a play of Shakespeare. Given the millions or billions of recreated simulations of that first play, What are the chances that your first time seeing it is the first time the play was played.  Now extrapolate that idea out to a few 10s of trillions of years that we expect the universe to support life, and consider that we are already simulating small bits of reality for scientific reasons.

cvxm2cc,1,t3_3ogmnr,FireFoxG,"To ELI5 it.

Something going to speed of light travels any distance in zero time(from it's reference frame).  Thus, A particle with mass would require instantaneous and infinite acceleration which would require an infinite amount of energy to do.

Think of it like this. At 0.99999999999999 c, for every day on board a spaceship, nearly twenty thousand years pass for the observer at rest(earth, etc).  So in 1 day on the ship we would get 1/4 way across the milkyway.  Conventional physics still applies, so the amount of energy that it would require to push a ship 20,000 ly over the course of 1 day is still required, which means the acceleration would be insane, which means the amount of energy would be insane.

If you add one more 9 to that figure above, and you are now moving 61286 ly per day(from the ships rest frame) so you now need enough conventional energy to move something 61285 ly in 24 hours. As you might have figured, the closer you get to C the more extreme the time dilation becomes, which means the amount of energy becomes ever more absurd.

To put this in more human terms, think of how hard it is to push your car... now imagine how much hard it would be pushing it fast enough to move it entire light years within a day.",1,0,1444697993,1444718726
cvwsm41,0,t1_cvwrjle,FireFoxG,">but let's not make things up about Assad, his government is a dictatorship which is also likely responsible for half the deaths in this conflict.

Brought to you by the same people who said Saddam was allied with Al Quida and had anthrax/WMDs(The US gave Iraq the WMDs back in the 80s then got rid of them and the anthrax was from a US military lab). 

If you take 5 seconds to listen to what the protesters were saying back then about Iraq... the sames ones(Ron Paul, Noam Chompsky, McClatchy, etc) are saying that the US funded terrorists basically faked the ""chemical weapon attack"" and the US blamed it on Assad.  If you can buy that the US is funding ISIS... Then it's not much a stretch to understand they are lying, ** yet again**, to the American people about what is really going on.

It's amazing that anyone believes the US government after all the shit they have pulled off.

PS, you should read what Russia was saying about Iraq before we invaded... It should drastically change your worldview.  What they said would happen is exactly what happened. Then go listen to what they are saying today. http://cns.miis.edu/stories/030217.htm

You sure about that?  Russia is fielding global reach MIRV nuke systems, and probably orbiting strike platforms(seeing as how they are basically the only country on earth with a decent space program). Pretty sure not even the US could take down what Russia is fielding.

The US is not going to risk nuclear war to take out Assad, at least I hope not.",1,0,1444639547,1444718726
cvwqv76,0,t1_cvwqbw1,FireFoxG,"Whatever floats your boat man.

Even if that were true... it's not, but if it were, The US is still funding terrorists that are trying to overthrow an elected government that is recognized by the UN, China and Russia as legit.

Throw in some Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan for good measure and there is no other valid conclusions one can come to, other then the US is funding ISIS in the same countries whos governments we directly destroyed or are trying to destroy.... Or the US government is so inept that it has the same effect as the above conclusion. Either way, ISIS is driving American military vehicles around, and shooting everyone with US military hardware.

>Just because Fox news keeps trying to make it seem like everything is always a failure and they are the solution doesnt mean it actually true.

People might have trouble telling the 2 apart because the FSA only exists in the newspapers, not reality... And the US government confirmed it.  Meanwhile there are 1000s of videos online of ISIS driving around brand new tanks, Humvees, Toyotas and using brand new TOWs.
