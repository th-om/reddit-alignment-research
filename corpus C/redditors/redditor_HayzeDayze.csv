cvxfgrx,0,t1_cvxfc36,HayzeDayze,"I would think that satire on a group I disagree with would make me laugh more than satire on a group I agree with. Wouldn't you agree? Now, he isn't necessarily making that big of a change. But changing from a joke on Republicans (by being a hyperbolic example of them) to more limited, moderate jokes I would say I disagree with you.

And there are many forms of comedy, some hit with different people.",1,0,1444687425,1444731564
cvxfbdz,0,t1_cvxeyyi,HayzeDayze,"Well considering that he was playing satirical character of Republicans, with humor directed towards left-wingers (most of the time) and now is interviewing in a more moderate sense; I would say that my political persuasion has a lot to do with it.",5,0,1444687195,1444731564
cvxc2od,0,t1_cvxc01n,HayzeDayze,"That's actually a good point. It didn't cross my mind (and it should have) that he is needing to be more moderate. 

I'm a liberal, so this makes a lot more sense.


Edit: I'm surprised that this point has to be made. Obviously his old show was a joke on the right wing by being a hyperbolic example of them. I myself am a liberal so I found it humerous. His jokes are more moderate since he doesn't have such a distinct group watching and needs to appeal more. Thus his jokes don't hit home for me as much.",2,0,1444682397,1444731564
cvxb5pj,0,t1_cvx71zo,HayzeDayze,"By who? I'm not disagreeing, I would just love to see the sources on that. IMO, they both are equally likely to have done it, but I am inclined to believe the government hoping to retain power would use violence more (except this itself is extremely debatable).",8,0,1444681113,1444731564
cvxb23z,0,t1_cvxabjo,HayzeDayze,"Really? I thought it was more light humor and didn't address to many intense topics.

But I might have been biased because I was thinking of the Colbert Report the entire time.",14,0,1444680977,1444731564
cvxaw2p,0,t1_cvwszuz,HayzeDayze,"So I read the study, and I actually wrote a paper during college about the lack of referencing to the Nanjing massacre.
If you look at many of the textbooks they DO discuss the Nanjing massacre. But they discuss it extremely limited. Even as much that 80 percent of the textbooks studied only hold 1 sentence (such as ""The destruction of Nanjing occurred after/before..."" or vague sentences like that.

So while the Stanford article says they are not ""detailed"", it is correct. But the truth is in the details, which they void.

I don't know about the other Japanese issues like expansion, etc. I only did it on the Nanjing massacre. But, IMO, it is not recognizing the atrocities if you only write one sentence or a short paragraph after the rape and murder of thousands.

Food for thought when reading studies like these I guess.

Edit: oh and I would like to add. My course on Chinese history was very biased, which is why I avoided all the sources my teacher recommended. I have a degree in Poli. Sci. and have a lot of access to sources which ""attempt"" to avoid bias. So I attempted to not be biased just for my teacher.",25,0,1444680739,1444731564
cvvr1dw,0,t1_cvv1j3t,HayzeDayze,"I think that can be said for almost anything.

On that note, I studied the topic when I was a Sophmore and Junior in college and he seems pretty on par. I would say he seems verrrrry slightly to the Palestinian side.

Why would you say he is biased?",1,0,1444567733,1444731564
