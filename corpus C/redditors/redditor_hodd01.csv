The concept of ""nothing"" is near impossible for me to conceptualize but rationally I know that ""nothing"" is waiting for me in a few decades or sorrowful accident along the way. I ,as many others, have and continue to go through phases of fear of this nothing which neither optimism nor faith have could fully fix. However I find solace in the rational  of the physicist philosophers that the my body, thoughts and being are the remains of the vast universe of which millions or billions of years later I, my atomic self, will return. Fear, regret and sadly joy will then be as foreign to me as nothing is now, for I will be a star once more. ",2,0,1443812175,1444724218

“A universe without purpose should neither depress us nor suggest that our lives are purposeless. Through an awe-inspiring cosmic history we find ourselves on this remote planet in a remote corner of the universe, endowed with intelligence and self-awareness. We should not despair, but should humbly rejoice in making the most of these gifts, and celebrate our brief moment in the sun.”
― Lawrence M. Krauss""",6,0,1443807792,1444724218
cvloeya,0,t1_cvlnmw0,hodd01,"Your message resonates with me so strongly. I however am blessed that I have no lost my wife or any close loved ones but know to the core of my self that if I had to go through what you have done, I would drop everything and try to join some suicide level military unit to achieve an honorable death. 

My thoughts and hopes are with you. 

Edit: Wanted to clarify what we all know and even you deep down know, your wife's love for you is not attached to her body but her spirit and while, as you have read, I too would want to waste away, your wife would want you to be happy, even if that is harder for you than death.",3,0,1443795757,1444724218

From doublelift moving in with travis, to saint v hotshotgg drama, jiji the king, and many more unique memories CLG has grown and regardless of their final standings will continue to grow. I am proud of the organization and happy for hotshot as a 27 year old man I teared up watching his victory speech and think my old frozen heart will explode if they win worlds.

cvdss12,0,t1_cvddv0z,hodd01,"See the war on prostitution, murder, DUI's, ect they all still occur so it is apparent that our legal system does not care about a perfect solution but reducing an action. If we outlawed abortion, would it still occur? absolutely, but it would happen less than today and that would be the objective of the law. Now are the consequences of the law worth the cost? Is it a good and moral law? It is all open for debate but the idea making perfection the enemy of good is setting ones self up for failure. ",8,0,1443193576,1444724218
