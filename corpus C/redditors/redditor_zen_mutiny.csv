This.

In fact, there's any number of ways it could have been done. The earthquake scene should have actually been traumatic for the player, rather than mere spectacle. ",2,0,1444663044,1444724026

cvww7zb,1,t3_3ofzoe,zen_mutiny,"A large part of GTA IV's development time was spent building a new engine for the next generation of consoles. That work being out of the way, the developers had more time to focus on the 'finer things' in GTA V. AC:Unity suffered the same issue as GTA IV -- not being as fully fleshed out, due to working with a new engine, and ACIII suffered the same fate before it. You can also observe over the course of GTAIII to Vice City to San Andreas, how the engine became more refined, the feature list grew, and graphics and physics became better, even though all three games were built on the same engine for the same hardware.

cvwfr0c,0,t1_cvvnr3x,zen_mutiny,"TBH, I think Ubisoft could make a better Batman open world game than Rocksteady ever could. Especially if it was based on the DCAU. They've demonstrated that again and again with Assassin's Creed. The way you feel as an Assassin who can take down a whole squad of enemies at a time without even breaking a sweat, and then throwing down a smoke bomb before disappearing into the night is exactly what I would love to see in a Batman game. Oh, and leave in AC's entire free-running system, plus the grappling gun and using the cape to glide. Batman should be fast like an Assassin, not slow and cumbersome like he was in Arkham City. Ubisoft has already shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that they can handle a Batman game. ",1,0,1444612293,1444724026
