As soon as you need help, government intervention and spending are all just fine and dandy, but when it's anyone else who needs help it's pork and government overreach. And even after the government give you the funding you need to fix things, the next time another state asks for emergency aid I just know we're going to hear all about how we spend too much or that government is useless.

cvx6zgw,0,t1_cvx6t1o,PoliticalMadman,"The ones that voted in politicians who refuse to believe that government can be used for good? The ones who are constantly complaining about taxpayer money going towards ""moochers"" or ""leeches"" or anyone who isn't them? If they think that government is unnecessary then this is the perfect opportunity to prove it. ",46,0,1444675128,1444725141

There is actually a lawsuit going on right now between Beverly Hills and City Hall. But they already started building the subway anyway, so I'm pretty sure they're just going to tell Beverly Hills to get over it. Here's hoping. ",3,0,1444623382,1444725141

When you're in control of a high speed metal box you better be looking where you're going and damn sure that you are functional enough to handle it. ",15,0,1444494695,1444725141

cvu1g7f,1,t3_3o37cr,PoliticalMadman,Good god the comments here are poisonous. Are there people who are honestly celebrating the deaths of over a thousand innocent people? How many different kinds of disgusting do you have to be to cheer for people dying needlessly? ,5,0,1444418947,1444725141
