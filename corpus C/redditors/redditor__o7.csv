cvx7lma,1,t3_3oh1cp,_o7,"I've increasingly started to hate Kaspersky more and more.

Over the last week I have been fighting with them to get our LEGITIMATE OWA URL re-categorized from Phishing because their support team is dense.  We don't use their software but one of our remote users reported it and they are unbelievably dense when I am asking them to just re-categorize a URL.",2,0,1444676020,1444717336

Mostly been pulling samples out of our email filtering that it hasn't identified and tinkering with REMnux. I'll probably be sent off to the SANS FOR610 GREM course (we do one a year at my company) soon.

I appreciate it and will keep you in mind.",1,0,1444672925,1444717336

I'd say passing a major certification is an accomplishment that can fall under the what you've done.  Not all of them are braindumpmindlessbullshit exams.  I can see your point though because I've interviewed a loooooot of people and I see the same correlation you do.",1,0,1444663397,1444717336
