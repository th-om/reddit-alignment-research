cvx2joa,0,t1_cvx1s9r,bigfootplays,">2.4 per year is 5 months per partner. Are you saying that dating someone for FIVE MONTHS is not enough time to decide to have sex with them?

That assumes that in every relationship, the person waited 5 months, had sex once, broke up, and got a new boyfriend/girlfriend the next day, which is both highly unlikely and, if true, would show a deeper problem. As a side note, the earliest I've ever had sex with someone I was dating was 6 months in and even in that scenario, it was her idea, so five months does seem like too short of a time for me.",4,0,1444668654,1444719564
