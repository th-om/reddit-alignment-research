cual3rl,0,t1_cuakny2,ikcubose,"No, it would have the same performance function, not the same vocal function.  That's the point, the highest registers of males and females are different.  There is no reputable text that will say any differently.",1,0,1440161286,1444731692
cuakh1m,0,t1_cuaguo8,ikcubose,"* This classification of registers is pre-
sented in Table 5.
Registers heavy, thick, normal, modal, and chest
are produced in mechanism M1.
Registers falsetto, loft, and head for women, thin
and light are produced in mechanism M2.*

That is the direct quote, from the article.  Falsetto is different than head voice, because of the overtone associated with each voice.  Yes both are produced by the same mechanism, however by that logic so is chest and modal voices.  So you are incorrect to say it is the same, however I wouldn't be opposed to say that they are comparable in some sense; as you referred to them both as m2 it has to do *soley* with the relationship to the intrinsic refer of that voice type.

cu9wicr,1,t3_3ho78q,ikcubose,"Disclaimer: I am at work so I can't listen to the recording.

**however** biologically female sopranos, don't have falsetto.  There is a practically similar whistle tone, however since you are untrained my bets are not on whistle tone.  It is probably unsupported upper notes (head voice).  Will listen when I get home.

edit: Okay So I did listen to the recording and /u/cupcakecakecup you have a lovely voice, I really enjoy listening to you!  From a technical standpoint, there doesn't sound like you are doing anything that will injure your voice in the long run, just support your sound a little more.  Secondly I stand by my initial assumption you're certainly not using your middle (modal) voice on those high notes, however I might not call it a head voice either.  What I would guess is happening is you have learned to shift something in your voice in order to hit those high notes, due to a lack of breath support.  Fix the breath and surely your high notes will follow with more volume and resonance *if* that is the type of sound you are shooting for.  If you want to stick with the soft singer-songwriter thing that's awesome! Keep singing!

Also /u/Guzxzy I would refer you to Barbara Doscher's The Functional Unity of Singing where she clearly delineates the difference in the male and female registers and why the male voice's upper registers is termed differently than the female's upper register.
