Who is so down trodden they can't afford the verification for a state ID while at the same time is unable to qualify for government benefits (which also require the same SS verification) who is also unable to sign an affidavit at the polling place which says they are able to vote? The idea that some portion of eligible voters cannot vote because they are so destitute is a complete myth. What other country in the world doesn't require voter ID, or ID for the most basic services?",6,0,1444173989,1444726992

It's outrageous for them but the law of the land when it comes to obamacare or gay marriage.
