I don't think the hands of time can be turned back by tweaking things here and there.  We need some massive reinvestment in our people and infrastructure.  Not just tax breaks for the rich and the corporate.

You must be delusional.  Companies want to do everything in their power to reduce tax payouts.

The larger problem is not with them exactly but more so with the lawmakers.

Also Snapchat != Facebook.  How can you really think they honestly lost $28.5M without using the loopholes that exist?",0,0,1444667158,1444728770
