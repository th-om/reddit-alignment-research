It sucks, but what's worse? Making $11-13 in a field you love that will eventually increase with time, or working in retail for $15 forever? ",1,0,1444335352,1444716899
cvsuq4t,1,t3_3nwneo,stripes_by_proxy,"I graduated almost 9 years ago and I'm still not sure of what I *really* want to do with the rest of my life. You have plenty of time to figure it out as you go. In the meantime, work in a lab. Any lab. Or at least do something that's related to your degree. The bigger that gap is where you didn't do anything science-related, the harder it will be for you to get hired anywhere once you do figure out what you want. ",2,0,1444333614,1444716899

cvrisq6,1,t3_3nuzlg,stripes_by_proxy,"Once, when I was like 12 and was looking for where my parents hid my SNES controllers because I was being punished, I found a VHS tape with some title that suggested it could be porn. Excited, and home alone, I run to the VCR to pop it in. It was porn, but it was so incredibly low quality and lame that not even my hormone-fueled self in the pre-internet age was excited at the find and I felt like I was getting a depressing glimpse into the failing sex life of my parents. I put it back where I found it and pretended it never existed.",2,0,1444240856,1444716899
