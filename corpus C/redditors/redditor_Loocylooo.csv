cvxko2h,1,t3_3ogpb4,Loocylooo,"So for the first couple of years of both our kids' lives, the kids referred to me as ""daddy"" and their dad as ""mommy"" and wanted ZERO to do with me. It totally sucked. When they woke up in the middle of the night, they wanted their dad. When they were sick, they wanted their dad. Dad was the one to bathe them, read them bedtime stories, etc etc. I tried to not let it bother me, but it did big time.

And then like almost overnight at about the same age for both of them (around 2-1/2), they suddenly became ALL ABOUT MOMMY. We're talking Stage 5 Clingers, up my ass, had to be with me all the time. They're 5 and 7 now and I don't see that slowing down.

(I do notice that it seems to correlate with about the time they started getting into trouble for realsies, and their dad is stronger on punishment than I am, so that may be why there was the switch. But I'm loving it, so whatever)",2,0,1444695826,1444724146
cvwvy63,1,t3_3oegqq,Loocylooo,"My situation is a little different because we were only together six months when we got married, and I was six weeks pregnant at our wedding (oopsie!). So I don't know what it is really like to be married without a super needy baby in the house (got pregnant again when that kiddo was 14 months old, so clearly we found time for sex!)

Anyway. We go through phases where it seems like we are more roommates than lovers, and that's ok. We just acknowledge that hey, this is a rough time in our house (like when the baby was teething, or when he got sick, etc). 

The newborn stage can be rough. Newborns so, so demanding, especially if you have a colicky baby. We just told ourselves this wouldn't be like this forever! And that really helped get us through the exhausting, omg what did we do, parts of being parents.

But there is nothing sexier to me than my husband cradling our sweet babies in his arms, or when he reads to them at bedtime. You just see your partner in a different light, and it can be really beautiful - that could also be the hormones talking, but I did cry once watching him bathe our son, just how gentle he was with him! 

Anyway. Communicate, acknowledge what the other person is feeling, and when you are going through the less than glamorous parenting bits remind yourself it won't be this way forever. Our kids are 5 and 7 now and things are pretty spectacular over here, and have been for a couple of years now (pretty much once both were potty trained and sleeping through the night)",1,0,1444657171,1444724146
cvweh7q,1,t3_3oaq3c,Loocylooo,"I don't know if it is the same at every school, but in my program at least non-thesis also meant non-support, IE I wouldn't have gotten any assistantships. My program (civil engineering) saw non-thesis as more for people who were working full time while getting their masters. Anyway, just as a heads' up in case that would important for you.

(And, go OSU! I went there for undergrad, and it is amazing. I miss that place every day and wish I had stayed for grad school)",2,0,1444609915,1444724146
cvweeaj,1,t3_3odg3s,Loocylooo,"My bachelor's is in chemistry, and I went to graduate school for civil engineering, with my emphasis on environmental engineering. The switch for me was super easy, but maybe that's because it was civil. I did take a year and a half of pre-reqs first before I made the jump - basic engineering courses and a few geared to civil (statics, dynamics, thermo, fluid mechanics, hydraulics, hydrology, unit operations, etc). 

Anyway, I didn't have a hard time getting in. I had a solid GPA and the advisor that took me on wanted someone with my background, so it was a good fit for both of us. 

(Oh, also to say it was a Masters program, which may be different as well, but I did have several friends who had a bachelor's in something other than engineering that went on to get PhDs in civil engineering, so I'm adding my experience in case a CivE person stumbles on this question)",3,0,1444609763,1444724146

cvwbdc3,1,t3_3ocw6o,Loocylooo,"I just talked and talked and talked. And then talked some more. We counted everything. Grocery trips took a little longer when we did it, but I'd say, ""Let's count out four apples,"" or I would just do little quizzes with them like ""What fruit is yellow?"" or point out shapes and have them list off what they saw. Just stuff like that. We've now upgraded our math skills to adding (my oldest is 7), so he ""helps"" me stay on budget during my shopping trips. I point out as many words as I can. I just don't do any designated learning time, I just point out stuff all day long. 

We read to them, but not super consistent until they were around 2 or so, and it wasn't nightly. But I always told myself if they brought me a book I would stop what I was doing (unless it wasn't possible, like cooking or taking a shower, lol) and read to them, even if it was for a few seconds.

cvwb6dx,0,t1_cvw3bg8,Loocylooo,"Why not read Roald Dahl and Harry Potter now? My favorite book growing up was ""The Phantom Tollbooth,"" so I started reading it to my kiddos when they were around 2, usually just a section at the end of the bedtime reading, when they were starting to drift off. I couldn't read about the cows that type anymore! ",9,0,1444603807,1444724146
