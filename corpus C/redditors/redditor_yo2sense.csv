cvxwskv,1,t3_3oj4lp,yo2sense,This article hit me pretty hard. It's absolutely true that I focus on American prosperity and dismiss the lives of foreigners. It's immoral and I have to do better. ,1,0,1444719275,1444721425
cvxw1ju,1,t3_3ojttp,yo2sense,"This is not the professor's best work. Though his deconstruction of Representative Ryan is spot on, Paul Ryan's position in his party stems from his undue media influence, Krugman exaggerates when saying the GOP is ""post-policy"". The Republicans have policies they'd dearly like to put into action. They just don't have any they can pursue with a Democrat in the White House. 

At the end the article misses the fact that the Speaker job is a career killer for anyone right now and for the forseeable future since the GOP is unlikely to be swept from the House or win the White House. The Freedom Caucus will RINO every Speaker who ""compromises"" with a Democratic President by keeping the government running. The GOP establishment will go along with that because keeping the ""crazies"" fired up is an absolute must for them to win the Presidency and if they can win they are all on the same page when it comes to hard right policies.

cvx29wt,0,t1_cvw17mn,yo2sense,"> ...In what alternate reality would being speaker be viewed as a benefit for a presidential candidate in today's GOP??? A regular congressman still has the benefit of being able to vote ""No"" on things...the speaker is directly tied to everything that ever comes to a vote

This. So much this. Becoming Speaker would kill Paul Ryan's political career. For the Tea Party it's not enough to be a right wing extremist like Ryan. For Speaker they want a right wing terrorist. Someone willing to let the entire country and the world economy itself fall apart around us rather than voting to continue funding Obamacare/Planned Parenthood. 

Whoever becomes Speaker will have to ""compromise"" with President Obama because most Americans are not OK with failing to keep the government open and risking default of the US debt. Speaker Boehner tried to show the Tea Party types how toxic this was by allowing the government to be shut down. It went as informed observers expected: people blamed the GOP for their extremism and their support crumbled. 

But that reality didn't bother the Tea Party types. They are in safe GOP districts so they don't worry about losing to Democrats. For them personally the best way to keep their jobs (and keep the fundraising dollars flowing in) is to never compromise no matter what. So they will trash whoever becomes Speaker as a RINO when he or she inevitably does their job and funds the government. Paul Ryan wants nothing to do with that and won't become Speaker unless the Tea Party Representatives agree to give him a pass. Which they won't because that would open them up to the same charges of being soft on liberalism they've been accusing Boehner and McCarthy of. ",1,0,1444668236,1444721425

But I don't agree that there is a skills gap that is holding the economy back. Paul Krugman calls this a zombie idea. As in, it was proposed and found to be wrong but is so convenient that economists who should know better keep dragging it out.

These groups remain static and yet you focus on individual responsibility. Your conclusion would make more sense if you saw poor but smart relatives become successful and rich but dumb relatives spiral down into poverty. 

Do you think it is a coincidence that the people on one side tend to make better financial decisions? Or better yet, what do you think would happen to you if you had been born on the poor side? Remember, this hypothetical you doesn't have the good habits you learned from successful parents nor their financial and emotional support. According to your observations, we should expect this new you to not make good choices and not be successful. Still think it's about individual merit? ",5,0,1444500665,1444721425
cvuw2zw,0,t1_cvuvebc,yo2sense,"I agree though I think the tax could be workable if it were much smaller than Senator Sanders is proposing. As in, an order of magnitude less. Low enough to disincentivize high frequency trading without becoming too much of a drag on regular mutual funds. 

Of course, that means less revenue for free college, the other Sanders' proposal I'm not in favor of. Personally I see no evidence that America has too few college graduates. What we need are jobs. Good jobs. I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask young people to finance their own education so long as there are enough jobs after graduation to allow them to pay off their debt.

http://afrikanblackcoalition.org/2015/09/a-new-constitution-or-the-bullet/

Reading it you can feel the anguish and frustration of the author. And for good reason. This isn't some nitwit bitching because they saw a Happy Holidays sign. People are dying. But that doesn't make his criticism of the Constitution any more compelling. 

He doesn't go into specifics other than that the Constitution protects killer cops but mostly focuses on how it was written by white men for white men. He goes into our racist history but never tries to come to terms with his specific objection. The Constitution protects cops who kill people for the same reason it protects noncops who kill people. And noncops who don't kill people. Constitutional protections are there for everyone. In theory we believe this means that while some guilty people will go free, innocent people won't be convicted. Of course, this theory isn't much comfort to blacks who have experienced first hand the rampant injustice in our justice system.

If we didn't have the Constitution should we believe that killer cops would not be protected? Of course not. No country would leave their police without legal protections. Who would take the job if they didn't? The author provides no evidence that the problem is the Constitution itself and not the white power structure in this nation. Even the most colorblind laws won't matter if we don't change the society around them.

So while we feel this guy's pain and forgive his lack of logic we shouldn't follow his lead. Nor should we attempt to further our own political agendas by pretending he is making, ""a direct threat of violence against those who disagree with him."" By saying it's replace the Constitution or bullets the author is not saying you have to agree or he will shoot you. He is saying that the situation will continue to devolve into more violence.
