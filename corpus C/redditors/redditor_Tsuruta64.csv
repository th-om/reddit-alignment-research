cvxi0fz,0,t1_cvxhcjl,Tsuruta64,"I don't agree with this at all. Rider is very well-developed, especially as the King who truly challenges Saber and Gilgamesh ( especially as the two don't really get the other). 

Saber, at the end of the day, gave the answer at the Banquet of Kings that we expect kings or rulers to give. Rider gave a completely different answer from what we expect - and gave a very solid framework for why and why Saber's idealism was completely wrong. ",2,0,1444691503,1444717750

Then again, everyone seems to ignore the actual best-written [character](http://i.imgur.com/6xfqUsO.gif) in my book, though his minor role in UBW probably didn't help in that regard. ",8,0,1444690301,1444717750

Right. Favorable.

cvx0s8f,0,t1_cvwzxe0,Tsuruta64,"Multiple problems here.

First, from a pure economics perspective, what the Soviets did was absolutely retarded and would lay the groundwork for their eventual collapse. Jumping straight to inefficient heavy industry is fine if you want to make tanks and planes, but not for actually making products which can compete on the global market. And Soviet industrial products were not capable of doing that at all.  

Look at China and Japan, for example. Neither of them jumped straight to heavy industry ( well, China tried under Mao, but we know how that turned out.) Both did light industry first, where their advantages of cheap labor proved more valuable in that field. Japan for years had the reputation of a country that produced shitty, cheap goods, like China does today. 

Second, of course American agribusinesses are better than Mexican subsistence farmers at growing crops. Shitty countries leverage the advantage of cheap labor, and then gain better standards and expertise, and then get around to making their goods which can compete with the world. 

>We couldn't beat Vietnam or China which is why they developed industry relatively on their own (and THEN liberalized trade).

Name one. What industry did Vietnam and China ""develop on their own?"" ",0,0,1444665893,1444717750
cvwwo7p,0,t1_cvww0i2,Tsuruta64,"Huh, they do. Countries overall were far less dependent on international trade then they are today, which means that cutting yourself off with tariffs is going to hurt even more.

As for the failures? Argentina is THE big one, but large chunks of Latin America and Africa implemented tariffs to ""protect infant industries."" Or you can look at China's efforts to develop industries by itself. ",0,0,1444658708,1444717750
cvwvp35,1,t3_3og4v8,Tsuruta64,"Minimum wage is a terrible way to end poverty.

Outright welfare or an EITC is a much better approach, because the problem with minimum wage is that rich people don't use stores which pay their workers minimum wages. Middle to lower class people do, which means that the middle to lower class people are the ones who will lose out when prices are raised thanks to minimum wages. 

Minimum wage's only advantage is that poor people can delude themselves into thinking that they're REALLY not dependent on government aid. Look at the commonly-used argument that low minimum wages means that we're all paying for it with welfare anyways. When the reality is that since taxes are mostly paid for by the rich, no it doesn't actually work like that. ",1,1,1444656598,1444717750
