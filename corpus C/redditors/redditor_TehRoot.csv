Usually the two outermost pylons are reserved for short-range IR air to air missiles for self-defence. ",1,0,1444713225,1444718254

For the 6600k's Iris HD pro. If you have multiple monitors you're going to need to either set one of them to use your motherboards onboard graphics, or I think if you only have one display you should be fine. It was annoying. 

So I have my primary capture display and one of the two other screens connected to my Fury X, then the third monitor is connected to my motherboard DVI port. 

Not sure why it works but it works. I'm using the latest OBS client. ",2,0,1444674947,1444718254

Supports Quicksync/NVENC/x264 for all of them. Maybe in the past it was only for recording. 

I couldn't get QuickSync to work properly but all I needed to do was install the correct intel graphics driver to use them for streaming. ",2,0,1444673981,1444718254
