One out of every ten ads was about Obamacare. Did you bother to read the article you linked?

>OK, so how do you make a health care plan that still solves the ""insurance companies spending billions of dollars to prove something was a pre-existing condition so they don't have to pay for it"" problem without using an individual mandate to make sure people don't wait to sign up for insurance until they're sick/injured?

Obamacare did it, obviously it can be done. The reason people don't wait to get insurance under the current system despite the undeniable lack of a mandate is due to the open enrollment system. You can't simply wait to get insurance until you're sick. Logically, if a system works that provides a monetary disincentive to not purchasing insurance, a system would also work that provides a monetary incentive to purchase insurance.

When was the last time a primary went to the convention?

>On one of the big issues of the day. So the Right in the party is going to call him an establishment moderate and treat him just like Romney.

Pundits haven't been openly hostile to Rubio in the same way theu were to Romney because, while it's an important issue, it pales comparison to Obamacare.

>So much the worse for him.

You've lost the plot. It's bad that he's a flip-flopper, but worse if he's not? That makes zero sense.

>Off year elections without Obama on the ticket.

My point is that if anti-Obamacare messaging was getting old, it wouldn't have worked better in 2014.

>Get rid of the mandate and keep the ""must insure"" and you bankrupt insurance companies.

Except that in practice, Obamacare doesn't include a mandate. It includes a penalty.

cvwgm5p,0,t1_cvwe0ty,teddilicious,"> Romney was a better candidate than any of the current candidates

Romney was the wrong candidate in 2012. Republicans best chance to beat Obama was to hammer him on healthcare, and they couldn't do that with Romney.

>Romney had the organization and the money...

Whichever Republican wins the nomination will have ample organization and money.

>...and the support.


Dead wrong. He only won the nomination because his opposition was split. Further, conservative pundits on talk radio and television were fully on the ""anyone-but-Romney"" train until he won the nomination.

>Rubio has immigration where he both went against his party voters and he flip flops.

Rubio is a far superior candidate to Romney. He's a fresh face for the GOP. His stance on immigration splits the party, unlike Romney's history on health care, which is unanimously disliked. Also, your overselling the extent to which he changed his position on immigration. He changed his messaging, but still supports a pathway to citizenship.

>If the ACA was old in 2012, it is an ancient rallying cry now.

They couldn't really attack Obamacare in 2012. When they ran on Obamacare in 2010, they won big. When they ran on Obamacare in 2014, they won even bigger. A Republican with a unique health care plan that removes the individual mandate, but keeps popular aspects of the law, would be hard to run against.

>What else can they hit Obama with?

You've made fun of the idea of attacking Obama on foreign policy, but he's weak there. Russia, Syria and Libya are all unmitigated disasters of policy.

>Clinton's baggage is all that gives the GOP a chance this round.

As if Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley or Jim Webb would waltz into the White House if Clinton wasn't standing in their way.
