cvrgv86,0,t1_cvreypx,jonathon087,My wife would fall into the category of teaching as a passion. It's a shame and I've mentioned this to here because she paid a tremendous amount of a four year degree to get a shitty job...,1,0,1444238107,1444720423
cvrgst6,0,t1_cvrfmh3,jonathon087,"My wife is on her third year of teaching, her first two were at a secondary language school where they were trying to transition Spanish speaking children to English (she was a kindergarten teacher). She made 29k there. We now live in Kansas City and she makes 39k. A significant raise (still not enough). She's in her classroom by 730 every morning and doesn't leave until roughly 430. The extra hours she puts in at home is ridiculous. Public teaching at anything lower than college level is just not worth it in this country and it needs to be fixed",6,0,1444238007,1444720423
cvqcss3,0,t1_cvpsknu,jonathon087,"You're probably right for the most part. I'd say Charles is about done (he hasn't slowed down yet but he can't carry us forever) and Houston can only do so much himself. Peters looks promising but it's only four games in. Berry is either still recovering or the cancer has impacted his future more than people like to admit. I'd say Poe is a special talent but he's been run into the ground every year and is likely still recovering from surgery this year (or maybe he is recovered but the surgery took a larger toll than we'd hope). And Kelce is just maturing. He's shown what he is capable of but still makes boneheaded mistakes. That's probably the list of true, top talent we have that would instantly replace a lot of players on other teams. The others are either average/above average or just players.

cvqcipv,0,t1_cvq6jny,jonathon087,"Pretty much this. Except I'd say Sutton needs to go as well. The guy just can't adjust. That seems to be this coaching staffs motto ""we don't adjust"". We've been outcoached in every game this year and almost lost to the Texans because of this. We're still going to ride out Reid's contract and it's going to hurt us in the long run as we have a team that can win now (barring Smith being Smith) and we're wasting it on this coaching staff. ",1,0,1444155343,1444720423
cvqbvqr,0,t1_cvqaufx,jonathon087,"Eh... We still have quite a bit of talent on the team, just in the wrong areas. Smith isn't the right quarterback, Reid isn't the right coach and neither is Sutton. Dorsey has done decently well, albeit forfeiting two second rounders for an average game manager and whiffing on his first two first round picks. ",2,0,1444154413,1444720423
cvq52k6,0,t1_cvq4zfw,jonathon087,"I don't understand.. the guy is nineteen years old and obviously still maturing. He's got douchiness written all over him, but you're complaining about some stupid shit right now. You're pretty much all that's wrong with this sports these days...",4,0,1444144228,1444720423
cvok9uf,0,t1_cvo5zat,jonathon087,And what difference does it make if we get in? It would be another one in done. Better off just burning everything down in hopes that Reid is fired ,1,0,1444015694,1444720423
cvok7zg,0,t1_cvohb02,jonathon087,I'd argue that we actually have less than fifteen percent of making the playoffs based on how shitty we've been ,2,0,1444015598,1444720423
cvo9os2,0,t1_cvo79yg,jonathon087,You seriously can't count seven field goals as a plus. That just shows inefficiency or coaching inadequacy... Literally nothing out of this game can be considered a plus. ,7,0,1443996876,1444720423
cvme26j,0,t1_cvm0ry7,jonathon087,I'm just saying that Reid/Smith are very legitimate and very large weaknesses that are hard to overcome,1,0,1443838643,1444720423
