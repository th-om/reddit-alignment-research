cvu3e2b,0,t1_cvu2erh,0x6A7232,True.  I just assumed that if you were going through all of this trouble and all that you would have already checked those (see the section about voltage drop). ,1,0,1444421888,1444717392

Better?",1,0,1444310515,1444717392
cvsfddm,0,t1_cvsdfw1,0x6A7232,That's good to know! It's actually way more convenient to test in vehicle usually. ,1,0,1444310076,1444717392
cvsav1n,0,t1_cvs6kyf,0x6A7232,Well..  That in combo with <13V DC while running means bad alternator (unless something else could cause both). ,1,0,1444295162,1444717392
cvs0tm2,0,t1_cvs0mkv,0x6A7232,"That's no longer a good way to test due to computerized controls, don't try that at home! (can either give a false positive, or damage components, I hear). ",2,0,1444268990,1444717392
cvs0rye,0,t1_cvs0drx,0x6A7232,"Of course, cheap fixes are always nice! 

If it did end up being the alternator, they are repairable, you could look on YouTube, but it would require some tools I'm sure, as well as removing the alternator (also on YouTube). 

Much cheaper than a new one, and of course having one swapped by a mechanic is more expensive yet. 

(I'm thinking a diode wouldn't be more than $5, someone who knows can chip in as to price and difficulty of doing such a thing. ) ",1,0,1444268914,1444717392

Wait... That's not quite right. The jerk circle? ",-5,0,1444268294,1444717392
