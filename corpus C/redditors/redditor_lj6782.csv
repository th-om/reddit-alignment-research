cvv8uo6,0,t1_cvv8eel,lj6782,"""Very rich as well"" - true, but Clintons don't even have half of what Trump *started* with. And she worked with him to ~~steal~~ earn more of that wealth than you'd think. And they are actually working to earn that money. Trump took his inheritance and invested it. All that is irrelevant to my point, though.

My point is that you can't put Trump on a pedestal for financing hid own campaign because none of the candidates have even a quarter of his worth.",1,0,1444518802,1444732254

cvtg9qu,1,t3_3nzrvp,lj6782,"Koch brothers foundations support ways to avoid raising taxes among other strongly libertarian views. This study (which makes some very unfounded, highly opinionated claims) concludes that this plan is better than raising taxes. This is not a coincidence.

Here's how the trust works:

Land was given to us by Fed at statehood on the agreement that the land is sold or leased and money only used for specific purposes (namely, education). AZ leases most of the land for grazing and other shit. Some of the land near urban areas is sold annually for development.

Most of the money goes into what is basically a money market account to make even more money. Meanwhile, a certain percent of total monies go to specific places, including 2.5% going to education. The more money in the account, the more the 2.5% is worth (and the money stays in line with state growth and inflation).

Here's how Ducey's plan works:

Up the % being pulled for education. Since more is being pulled, that % total amount will be worth less over time unless the economy booms. Ducey predicts that the amount would stay the same (as in not grow with the economy). Conversely, if it stays 2.5%, that lower % will mean larger amount each year (though it won't be at those 10% pull levels). Basically, we can pull a lot now and fuck future generations ""while we're in need"".

Nobody involved sees this as a permanent solution. Mostly ""we'll fix it all later when the economy is better""",6,0,1444372092,1444732254
