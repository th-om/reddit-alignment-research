If Syria was a democracy, it would elect a Sunni government and probably move away from Iran for religious reasons, reducing Iranian influence in the region. 

There wasn't much of a reason to not support him, until it became obvious a Syria without Assad would be like a Iraq without Hussein and a Libya without Gaddafi; a power vacuum would be created that would filled by terrorist groups and civil wars. But the majority of the Syrian population will never accept Assad's regime to continue, so the place will continue to be a complete fucking mess for the foreseeable future.",3,0,1444508089,1444717762

cvtybq8,1,t3_3o1skr,RationalRattachist,"The far left of America is kinda shitty if I'm honest. Bernie is only ahead in his home state and the state right next to his home state. Hillary is going to win the nomination with no real struggle. I think the more left wing part of the Democratic party will emerge if they lose the 2016 election, just like the far right emerged after McCain lost.

The far right emerged out of ecochamber news convincing them that Conservatives were the majority of the country and that if only McCain was a bit more right wing the GOP would have won. It was a complete fantasy, but people bought it. If Hillary loses the same will happen to the Democrats.

Keep in mind that no Democrat is calling for the common ownership of all industries, nor is any Republican in favour of putting blacks into concentration camps... (though Huckabee seems to be too casual about the concept of ethnically cleansing Palestinian territories)",2,0,1444414291,1444717762
cvt30x1,1,t3_3o038i,RationalRattachist,"The problem with Rand Paul is that modern American libertarianism is simply unelectable.

Rand's solution to every problem is ""get the government out of it"". This is problematic because it is a highly narrow view of the world and purely ideological, but it also makes modern Libertarianism to be unpopular on both sides of the political spectrum. 

Despite what both sides (especially Conservative) say, the American left and right both support a big federal government, but differ on the aspects of the federal government that should be big and small. Conservatives want a free economy and a strong and moral state, whilst modern Liberals want a mild to moderate amount of government regulation and a reasonably sized secular state.

American Libertarianism takes the ideas of the hard right and hard left, which alienates both sides. A Ben Carson supporter is not going to vote for a candidate that wants to legalise all drugs or even decriminalise them and no Democrat is going to vote for a candidate that wants to cut however many trillions in spending (as well as massive tax cuts).

As for why I have such strong dislike for the current Libertarian movement, it's because the way they see the world is far too narrow. The current movement is filled with people who seem to think that the minimum wage is more oppressive than being payed almost nothing. Why? Because of the government is wrong and the free market is right. This blind faith to the free market and hatred of the government simply doesn't make sense to me. Oppression can come not just from the government, but also from poverty and a lack of opportunity. What good is freedom when you can't get a decent job? What good is freedom when it creates a cycle of poverty? What good is freedom when you can't get health care? Less regulations is not the solution to all are problems. Grow up and learn to love pragmatism.",5,0,1444346452,1444717762
cvt1yyn,1,t3_3nzdrp,RationalRattachist,"Out of the current announced candidates, the only real option is Hillary.

Republicans like to think their brand of foreign policy is respected across the world, but it isn't. Last election, the only country polled that backed Romney over Obama was Pakistan, which had no affinity for Romney, just understandable hatred for Obama. I know just one British Conservative who supports the Republican party (and most of my friends are Tories) and he does so very reluctantly (he dislikes the Dems more than anything). Clearly, if America wants to be respected across the world and not be a laughing stock, it'll have no choice but to vote for a Democrat.

Out of the current Democratic field, Hillary is the best option. Biden isn't in yet, 3 other candidates are entirely unknown and Bernie presents himself too much as an anti-establishment hard leftist (and he's to the left of most world leaders by a decent margin). Hillary is associated with corruption but that doesn't stop Putin. She's known for being tough on foreign policy so the ""too weak"" question is not an issue.",2,0,1444344619,1444717762

Socialism as a word has changed its meaning over the centuries, and now mostly means a movement which wants to create relative equality of wealth, strong workers rights and quality public services. That's the best way to keep the movement alive. ",1,0,1444083546,1444717762

The myth that centrism lost the GOP the last two Presidential is honest to god hilarious. Were there really 5 million hard right voters stayed in on the day a Kenyan Muslim was up for re-election as President? Which position was Romney ""too left wing"" on?

Conservatives in America don't seem to get that people vote Democrat for more reasons than demanding ""free stuff"". They do it because the Republican party as of late appears to be hateful and on the side of the rich. Moderate your positions a bit and come back to the country again.",-1,0,1443971133,1444717762

Here's a great explanation as to why deficit fetishism is populist nonsense: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZNwdcESn90

People like Rand Paul use deficit fetishism in order to explain why we ""need"" to go through with hugely unpopular spending cuts. Because of the way they simplify economics to the household level, it is an effective electoral strategy. But ""Balanced Budget"" amendments are not serious economics.

On the issue of the current US debt, the deficit is gradually shrinking and the economy is growing. The debt may be increasing, but continued economic growth means the debt to GDP ratio will eventually come down. ",13,0,1443959777,1444717762
