cvxvffv,0,t1_cvxtlb3,uncannylizard,"The leaders of Hamas have said repeatedly, that the charter has no relevance to their actions today. They currently oppose a two state solution, but they also said that they would abide by the terms of one if the PA negotiated it and the Palsetinian people agreed to it in a referendum, even if they oppose the deal. They would campaign against it and try to convince the people to vote it down, but they still have pledged to abide by the terms of it if the people vote for it. 

They could be bullshitting but that's what they said. I think that their words should be tested. We don't have a lot of options since nobody is showing any signs of being willing to dislodge Hamas from Gaza. ",1,1,1444714943,1444718386
cvxvbiq,0,t1_cvxmuce,uncannylizard,"> I mean... come on! How about something like:
A3: Al Aqsa is a microcosm of the whole territorial conflict, a focal point for the melange of emotions Palestinians feel regarding their charge-ship of an Islamic treasure and their increasingly hopeless outlook towards the occupation force dominating their everyday lives. It's a symbol, a bit like the tea at the Boston Tea Party.

Well I think that you are reading too much into this. For example on the al Aqsa question my person answer was 'its an irrelevant issue'. I tried my best to simulate the wording that other view points out use to describe themselves out of fairness, not because I agree with them. 


> ...so I guess someone who says their ancestors 3000 years ago lived on this land, and my claim that ""this is my dad's house"" are equivalent?! I mean, they're both just 'historical claims', right?! Ugh.

My personal response to this question is 'no'. I do not believe that ancient history is relevant to the ocnflict at all or provides any legitimacy to either side. Again you assumed that I was arguing for a side that I wasnt arguing for. 



> ...I mean, you actually had to parenthesis the A4, but still break out pro-boycott into THREE slots and mash both the obvious anti-boycott stances into one? And only the anti-boycott gets a justification?

And once again you guess wrong about what my opinions are. I support a boycott on goods produced in settlements. By your logic I undermined by own perspective by dividing it into three sections. 

BTW I never saw this as a competition. I dont see why more responses of one choice or another would change anything. I dont think that people decide what side to support based on what number of redditors on this sub support which side. ",1,1,1444714635,1444718386

Yes, there was a history of low level violence from the 1800's to the British mandate period. Sometimes there was misunderstandings between the Jewish settlers and the locals, leading to raids or outbursts, but these conflicts were usually extremely limited and insignificant compared to the carnage existing pretty much everywhere else in the world, and especially compared to Jews everyone else on earth. By comparison Palestinian-Jewish relations were positively calm. 

The violence escalated as Jews started migrating to the region by the hundreds of thousands in the 20's and started creating designs for an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine. Britain was partial to the Jews and controlled the region, so the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem made the poltiical decision to ally with Germany in WWII despite the fact that the Nazi party was super racist towards Arabs. The mufti made that decision because Hitler promised to side with the Arabs when it came to a hypothetical state of Israel. 

Britain won WWII and ultimately established its exclusively Jewish state and this cultimated with the displacement of 700,000 Arab civilians from Israel who were permanently banned from the state. This then set the stage for conflicts between Arabs and Israel from 1948-1967. After 1967 and 1973 the Arab states completely gave up on any hope of defeating Israel  and have basically only been interested in Israel-Palestine when it suits their propaganda needs.

This new reality of a secure Israeli state is what made the PLO change its policies in the 1980's to recognize the new facts on the ground, that Israel is permanent. It was a huge breakthrough and the PLO and PA still embrace this change to this day. They recognized the state of Israel and endorsed a two state solution. It was a pragmatic compromise on their dreams. Of course the Arabs would prefer to control the whole territory and have the refugees return to their homes, but they recognize that none of this will actually occur. This is what is known as the Oslo peace process. 

However after that happened the occupation did not end. israel unexpectedly rejected the international consensus on the outlines of a Palestinian state alongside a jewish state and instead sacrificed peace on the altar of settlements. This is what prevents peace from occurring today. ",1,0,1444714056,1444718386
cvxuky5,0,t1_cvxl5s3,uncannylizard,"All of these problems are problems on the margins. These are not society eliminating problems. None of them are. As it is most Gazans rely on food aid because much of their infrastructure was destroyed by Israel and the strip is blockaded by the IDF. Things are already as bad as they can get for many people in Gaza and they subsist based on humanitarian aid. That status quo can continue indefinitely. There is no point at which the vast majority of the population will flee Gaza.

cvxdl9a,0,t1_cvxdgli,uncannylizard,"> Most of the Arabs living in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed, were offered Israeli citizenship, but most have refused, not wanting to recognize Israel's claim to sovereignty.

This doesn't include the vast majority of palestinians, those in the west bank and gaza. This is just two small high value regions that israel wants to annex while leaving the rest to have the remainder that Israel isn't interested in. Israel never offered an arab in the west bank, gaza or a refugee citizenship ever. The only time they have ever done it was cynically in small areas like east jerusalem where they want to annex a strategic area. If Israel wants certain parts of palestine then it must annex all of them. Not just a tiny fraction of them. The east jerusalem palestinians dont want to abandon their people in the west bank an live in an exclusively jewish state. Israel must annex them all if it wants to take over these regions.
