cvb0l68,0,t1_cvabk7n,controlroomoperator,"I appreciate you proving my point. To act as if passing new laws based on the idea of personhood, life, right to life or whatever, you have to acknowledge with those laws have to come with some form of punishment, right? The above answer truly reflects the unwillingness to discuss it by those who want to outlaw the procedure.

What is law without consequences? If the premise of proposed laws banning the practice is ""murder"" then we already have rules in place for exactly that. We won't just make up new specialized murder punishments because that would be counter to the idea that this practice is not in fact murder.",1,0,1442980492,1444725496
cva1cn3,1,t3_3lwfqf,controlroomoperator,"I'd just like to add in some things I've been mulling over for quite a bit. It's really bothering me that the ""pro-life"" position doesn't address a few key things. Outlawing abortion at all stages except medical necessity only affects the poor and middle class. People with means will always have access. 

The other issue is that once you outlaw it because in their eyes it is murder, how do you punish a women who forces a miscarriage? She is absolutely guilty of premeditated homicide of a ""baby"", in some states an absolute ticket to a death sentence. What are the consequences for obtaining RU486 or throwing yourself down some stairs or jabbing inside your uterus following some sketchy wiki instructions? Do we investigate all miscarriages as homicide investigations? Is it manslaughter if someone participates in risky behavior while unknowingly pregnant and loses the ""child""? What about negligence? There are so many legal ramifications of pursuing this ideology that it's very worrisome that it's not discussed.

cu0uvhg,1,t3_3gnprk,controlroomoperator,"Here are a couple I enjoy and I apologize for the lack of portions, I tend to overpour everything and then scale back until I find out how I like it.

Whatever Russian; Almond Milk, Atkins whatever flavor Shake, Vodka
Mix together and enjoy

Keto Margarita; Crystal light powder (or the cheap store brand; your choice of flavors), Jose Margarita Light Mix (also a ton of others on Amazon), Tequila, Ice

I blend the heck out of this and add powder until I get a flavor I like. Sometimes I add Sprite Zero or Diet Sierra Mist after to give it a little fizz.

ctvd1mv,0,t1_ctvc3jr,controlroomoperator,"Again, like I said before they do pay gas taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, hotel taxes, every other tax you pay through normal commerce which directly benefits the state of Alabama. The only taxes they don't pay are FICA, SS, and medicare/medicaid (and that's only if they're working completely under the table and not using false identity). Their tax burden is nearly exactly the same as residents of the state for the benefits they receive. They are not entitled to SS or Medicare/Medicaid so them not paying into it does not shift any burden.

This is my point entirely. They, immigrant workers both legal and undocumented, are a net benefit because they are doing work  for businesses that would not operate having to pay higher wages because we do not pay the ""real"" cost of things which allows more consumers to afford these items which flows through the economy. They are also not a drain on the government because they pay for the services they consume and not for the ones they don't. Here is the point. Even if they were legal AND being paid minimum wage, they still wouldn't be paying FICA and would probably qualify for earned income tax credits which would actually then be a bigger drain than before. 

So how are they a drain? This is what I keep asking. They help pay for the services and infrastructure you allude to. They don't get benefits that they aren't qualified for. How is this hurting our economy?",2,0,1438988649,1444725496
ctv1z6m,0,t1_ctv0943,controlroomoperator,"Again, I appreciate the reply. I think I'm confused as to what you're saying here.

>My appreciation is that there is a net loss for on the ecosystem altogether. The reason is that lower wages reduce the cost of goods and services which in turn stimulate consumption and make the economy move.

So it's a net loss but stimulates the economy? I think you're asking me how I feel about what it would do if we paid the ""real"" cost of things, maybe? I think it's a net benefit because we as consumers pay less for products serviced by these low income sectors because they tend to be necessities (food and clothing) and not luxuries. It's a net benefit for those coming and working these jobs because of two things; I am assuming that no one is forcing them do so and it is the best economic option available to them.

We started this off as a tax discussion which is what I was curious about because I really do see the argument that undocumented and immigrant workers are a drain on the system. Most of what I've read says otherwise which is why I had to pick your brain. Given that if you believe me, that they aren't a drain on the tax system, does this change your opinion at all?",2,0,1438971304,1444725496
