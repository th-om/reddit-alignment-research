cvxqlg4,0,t1_cvxmzvo,GEAUXUL,I fly over the Louisiana swamp twice a month. It's bad. The best advice I can give you is to look at the Louisiana coast in satellite view in google maps. Specifically look at the barrier islands south of Houma and New Orleans. Not too long ago most of the land above the barrier islands was green. ,65,0,1444705021,1444720316
cvwxybv,1,t3_3og064,GEAUXUL,"Awesome!!!

I'm glad MLS is willing to take the lead on so many soccer reforms. Soccer is by far the worst refereed sport in the world. It's not because the referees are terrible. It's because the rules basically set them up to fail. They are asked to make all or nothing, game-changing decisions in bad positions. This will give them a valuable tool to help them get that call right.",13,0,1444661146,1444720316

cvwx9h8,0,t1_cvwx1cz,GEAUXUL,"My posts speak for themselves, and I don't appreciate you trying to twist my words around. I said the government has a duty to protect human rights, not ""I'm ok with government coercion when what's being coerced is something I agree with."" I've got better things to do than talk to someone who keeps trying to strawman me.",2,0,1444659877,1444720316
cvwx1uk,0,t1_cvwtudd,GEAUXUL,"Sure. I'd guess that at least 30% of libertarians are anti-abortion. Again, abortion is a huge conflict of two rights that libertarians hold dear. There's a good
libertarian argument for both sides of the issue. ",2,0,1444659472,1444720316
cvwwt2y,0,t1_cvwvouy,GEAUXUL,"As a libertarian, I believe the main role of the government is to protect fundamental human rights. I believe the government has a duty to protect the right of that human being to live. It is factually and scientifically incorrect to call a fetus anything other than a human being.

To address your other points, if the woman is at risk of death obviously she has a right to end the pregnancy. I don't know of a law that forces me to risk my life to raise a child, and there is no law that forces the woman to raise the child so I don't know how you came up with that. Whether you realize it or not, your points are incredibly disingenuous.",3,0,1444658988,1444720316
cvwp5cv,1,t3_3of7i5,GEAUXUL,"Ok. I'm an atheist libertarian who is anti-abortion. I'll try to put my view as simply as possible. The reason why abortion is, and will always be a highly contentious issue is because it creates a direct conflict between two fundamental rights: the right of a human being to live, and the right of a human being to control his own body. When a woman chooses to have an abortion, they are exercising their right to control their own body, but by doing this they are infringing on the right of the human being living inside of them to live. The exact opposite would be true if abortion was illegal in this country. The state would protect the right of that unborn human to live, but they would do so by infringing on the right of that woman to control her her own body. 

At the end of the day, I think the right of one human being to live a full life should trump the right of one human being to control his own body on one single occasion. ",14,0,1444632378,1444720316

cvwohmr,0,t1_cvwodlj,GEAUXUL,Our self-imposed penalties is our hail-mary at not making things worse for us. Every Level 1 violation in recent history has included serious penalties like postseason bans. It could get much uglier.,2,0,1444630290,1444720316
