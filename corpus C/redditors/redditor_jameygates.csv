I'm always reading something mind boggling or watching a lecture or talk on YouTube or a podcast. We really are so lucky to have so much information avaliable to us. 

It very alienating though when nobody seems to care about the stuff you think about. I'm over here like ""does free-will actually exist?!"" or ""Do objective moral values exist?!"" And they just role their eyes at you, very heartbreaking for me at times. ",7,0,1443946762,1444720577
cvnehc7,0,t1_cvnaroh,jameygates,"The New Deal was absolutely a great cause for economic equality. It was a massive jobs program that enployeed millions of people. despite whatever minor discriminatory nature it had. After all, it was around 1940. It was incredibly progressive for it's time.

We followed a demand-side economic system in the post-War era, the most prosperous time in American history. Until the conservative revolution of the 1980's. 

Am I wrong? And if so, in what ways am I wrong?
