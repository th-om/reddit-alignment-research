But I just can't imagine ""So-and-so cast as so-and-so's father"" being a blip on anybody's radar.  It's casting news, it doesn't even rise to the level of spoiler.  If that's a spoiler then so is saying ""Television show X has characters in it.""  The new X-files was spoiled when they said Mulder and Scully were returning!!!  Really?",5,0,1444699675,1444723474

Seems like a rather large investment for new molds and such on GW's end to just have the same basic models, but more arm movement and the ability to turn sideways.",1,0,1444533760,1444723474

If you wanted to help your team raid, you probably had to do some rep grinding.
