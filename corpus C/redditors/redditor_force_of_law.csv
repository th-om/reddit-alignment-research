>(2) **Except as provided in RCW 69.50.4014**, any person who violates this section is guilty of a class C felony punishable under chapter 9A.20 RCW.

RCW 69.50.4014 says:

>Except as provided in RCW 69.50.401(2)(c), any person found guilty of possession of forty grams or less of marihuana is guilty of a misdemeanor.

So, possession of 40 grams or less of marijuana should be a misdemeanor, unless it's with an intent to manufacture or distribute, even if the person is under 21 (i.e., the prosecutor seems to have it wrong).  The law worked this way even before the amendment because the first section says:
>(1) It is unlawful for any person to possess a controlled substance unless the substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid prescription or order of a practitioner while acting in the course of his or her professional practice, or except as otherwise authorized by this chapter.",1,0,1442815005,1444725553

cpqw9ax,0,t1_cpqawgb,force_of_law,"Actually, all of these state ""religious freedom"" laws are based on an existing Federal Law (the [Religious Freedom Restoration Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Freedom_Restoration_Act)), which was introduced by a Democratic Congressman, passed nearly unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993.

Although the Federal RFRA applies to all religions, it was principally a reaction to some controversial cases involving the exercise of religion by Native Americans (e.g., the US Supreme Court upheld loss of employment benefits for using peyote in connection with a religious ceremony).  

The reason that states would need to propose these laws even though there is an existing Federal law is because the Federal RFRA was held to be inapplicable to the states by the US Supreme Court in 1997 (basically the Court held that Congress could not impose the standards under the RFRA on the states, but it still applies to actions of the Federal government).

The irony of the backlash over Indiana's proposed law (and other state laws like it) is that when the Federal RFRA was passed it was seen as a victory for civil liberties and supported by the ACLU, but when basically the same laws are proposed by conservative state legislatures, they are seen as nefarious and undermining of civil liberties.  In truth, they are a double-edged sword.  ",1,0,1427332211,1444725553
