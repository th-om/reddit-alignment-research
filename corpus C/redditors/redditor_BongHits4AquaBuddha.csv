I don't see how the Republican was the big-money candidate in those elections. Booker raised [more than 16 times more than Lonegan in the 2013 special election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_special_election_in_New_Jersey,_2013#Fundraising) and [more than 44 times more than Bell in 2014 election.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_New_Jersey,_2014#Fundraising)

NJ is a very blue state. It's not at all surprising that Booker won by a large margin. [It's been over 40 years since NJ last elected a Republican to the US Senate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Senators_from_New_Jersey) And at no point in [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_special_election_in_New_Jersey,_2013#Polling_3) or [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_New_Jersey,_2014#Polling_2) did Booker have a lead of less than 10 percentage points.",2,0,1444421190,1444718466
