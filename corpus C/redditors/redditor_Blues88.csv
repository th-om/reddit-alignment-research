From the mouth of babes:
> I did injure my knee a bit so I missed couple of days in camp and the first four games. I got back as if it was nothing major.

Oh ok, so you missed some time. Time doesn't stop. Tough break. 

>I came back, and the team won its first five games. I got scratched, but okay, the team was winning. We lost seven in a row, then I wasn’t even close to playing. Scratch, scratch.

Gives no other insight. How were you feeling? What were practices like? I notice he doesn't say that he was the best option, and why wouldn't he if he felt he was? He's not shy about airing laundry.

>I played three games, no two games, I think, three minutes a night… The only time I touched the ice was when the fourth line was on, and the faceoff was in the neutral zone.

Far be it for me to be naive enough to think there aren't axes to grind in pro sports. This, after all, is a coach who thought Dan Cleary was a useful player when every other metric said otherwise.

But what would this indicate? Maybe Commodore was a bit of a liability? Maybe he was rusty? Maybe he was a whiner who felt victimized from day 1? Whatever it is, I doubt very seriously if Commodore was good enough to take someone's spot, Babcock would put his team in a worse position by not playing him. Not exactly a terrible 5,6,7 for [Detroit in 2012](http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DET/2012.html) either.

Maybe he didn't get quite the chance he was looking for, but he's still acting like a douchebag.  At the end of day, I don't know....play better. Or don't. But take some responsibility at least.

I don't see a comparable between the Perron trade and the Oshie trade, though both were just sketchy returns. Oshie was a way more useful player. If we're shipping people off due to playoff performance, we'd barely have a top 6.

cv7z78f,0,t1_cv7qqja,Blues88,">Who's more likely to be shot by a cop? A rich black kid from a gated community, or the poor one from the inner city?

And both of these black kids are way more likely to be shot by a cop than a white kid of any socioeconomic background. I think that's the issue. Some black Americans aren't living in poverty due solely to racism, but there has been an historic and deliberate racial component to how black americans were treated in larger society with respect to fairness and opportunity. Real estate segregation was real and effectual. 

You raise good points and I agree that there is a ton of nuance involved in the issues that join race, class, and poverty. I guess I'm of the mind that an entire segment of the population was enslavened, ""freed"", and then harshly discriminated against for another 100+ years is enough to consider race to be part of the bed rock for black poverty in a way that white poverty has never and likely will never experience.

BLM is a large movement with many opinions filtering through many individuals. They're like every other group...banded together by an overarching goal but possessing numerous avenues to reach their destination. The Sanders rally was, to me, handled poorly because the BLM participants couldn't break themselves from that agitation mindset that can be, at times, absolutely necessary. In this particular case, Bernie and his people gave them a forum, but they were too entrenched in that ""we demand to be heard"" mode that they couldn't calm themselves as soon as Bernie yielded and start their conversation. But shit....emotions are high. They likely aren't used to being yielded to. Is that girl who spoke probably a bit of a douche? Maybe. Has she bungled her message a bit? Probably. But the rage is authentic. It has to be, and as a white guy, I can't understand what the american black experience is like, but I can accept and support the visceral feeling that it stirs. 

I'm just going to assume you're non-black and american (here in america we tend to reflexively call this category of person ""white""... har har). So the reality of ""needing"" identity politics, a broad term by the way that I'd argue we all utilize, is likely less necessary for you and I. I'm an atheist, I'm white, I'm lower middle class. I'm in the same kind of rigid boxes as everyone else, but these rigid boxes are way more abstract in the way they effect my every day, because I'm not feeling marginalized by any of these facts about myself. No one is discriminating against me for things that are clearly, within reason, in my control. So I can't imagine being discriminated against for something completely fixed, like skin color. 

While I can sympathize with what I think you're saying, and you're right, some people sensationalize and broaden the definition of identity, sometimes to an absurd degree. But I'd counter that it is factual to say that some people simply don't like some other people because they are dark skinned. And some of these same people have been in positions where they could determine who gets an opportunity or a good or a service, and they've used this color -bias to disproportionately affect brown people they don't like. Race, I'd argue, is at the epicenter of poverty and crime for many black americans.
