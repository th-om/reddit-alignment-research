cvxy9bt,0,t1_cvxy4ol,thecrazing,"There's never going to be *resolution*. GG aren't like, abolitionists or prohibitionists or suffragettes, with concrete, explicit laws they want enacted.  But, more importantly, GamerGate isn't apolitical either. Specific beefs with the industry aren't the gas driving the engine.  It's anti-SJW stuff, and that's not the kind of shit that gets *resolved*. 

Almost certainly the GamerGate term itself will lose steam, but then there will just be a common thread leading towards some other political stance / system / group.

Some of GG's 'leaders' / talking heads will change views drastically, most of them will change views slowly;  some of GG will get bored and drop out, some will get new responsibilities that tug them away, some new ones will get interested and join, some of GG will change their minds drastically, most of GG will continue to care about anti-SJW stuff but eventually find other places / banners to cluster under.  

Much of the same happened for those abolitionists / prohibitionists / abolitionists anyways. And GG doesn't even have those goals to work towards, so..

cvxxine,0,t1_cvxxfgg,thecrazing,"I know this is a crazy idea, but maybe the sub could think about a sticky of like.. 'Established things to take for granted'?  Like.. Conclusions we've decided are correct and don't need to be revisited?  I feel like I've successfully made this case of 'Well no she didn't go there to say that, she was just invited, and..' before. 

Like, Settled Conclusions:

Sarkeesian *didn't* go to the UN to advocate for laws to override the first amendment with Chinese style dictatorship.  

Sarkeesian *does* have a background in marketing / event planning.

But that's also crazy, clearly. :P  In no way would anything be agreed on. ",1,1,1444722006,1444730090
