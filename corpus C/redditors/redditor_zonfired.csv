cvx31mt,1,t3_3ogkll,zonfired,"A good portion of conservatives are people of faith. Some are people of faith to the core of who they are. If you don't know what that is like its hard to explain or understand. The best example I can think of is radical islam. They believe so much in what they are taught they will die and kill others. Things such as abortion and even homosexuality are wrong to their core. And while abortion has evidence to back up their claim that it is a life if people don't believe in the concept of a soul they don't understand. 

Their is much less evidence that homosexuality has any negative side effects must arguments christians  can make about it has to logical backing. Its no surprise people don't understand and think they are monsters for having the belief they do. But thats faith. Their faith has told them the behavior is wrong and they will trust their is a bigger reason why that they don't fully understand. 

When I was young my pastor explained that you do not have sex before marriage. I argued why ? I see its in the bible but with all forms of birth control while accidents can always happen its pretty safe these days as long as your not a huge whore. He said because that woman was a gift from God to her parents. Its not her right to give that gift to you. Only in marriage can the parents hand that gift over to you. That makes NO logical sense. But thats faith it is not logical.",2,0,1444669411,1444724936
cvsly22,1,t3_3nymkm,zonfired,I doubt this will be popular here but the last time I heared applause in a theater was at the end of Kingsman when they blew up the people at the end specifically the African American man that was in the White House. I was shocked at the number of people IN MILWAUKEE that applauded. ,0,0,1444320823,1444724936

cvbi6xq,1,t3_3m0ltx,zonfired,The ACA. I was all for it till our health insurances skyrocket and my sister lost her job at Assurant. In both cases we were told specifically it was because of ACA. I tried to keep in mind it was helping others but the reality of how it affected me was to much to ignore.,8,0,1443026414,1444724936
