cvrw59n,0,t1_cvrvog5,NothingCrazy,">If your making someone's day worse by annoying them, then the right thing to do is stop annoying. Making someone else's day better at little cost to yourself is the right thing to do.

So the white bus driver whose day was made worse by Rosa Parks had a point when he asked her to move to the back? I'm certain he found her choice of seats annoying, and she could have moved at little cost to herself. 

I bet that right now you're objecting to the comparison. Still, I think, we can both agree that your point isn't ***always*** valid. It applies only in situations where the request is reasonable. If his cube is  quiet, then there is no good reason to ask him to stop cubing. 

Also, I think you're underestimating the cost, here. OP's time is valuable. He probably doesn't get much chance each day to practice (who among us does, except maybe some high school kids?) So I would hardly consider the loss of 20 minutes of time that could be spent an a fun hobby trivial.

Think of it this way. Someone on a train didn't like what OP was doing, so they asked him to stop practicing his hobby for 20 minutes. How would that go over if you went up to some kids playing frisbee  on a sidewalk and said ""That thing you guys are flinging around is distracting me, and you're not being completely silent. If you wouldn't mind, stop doing it for 20 minutes or so."" 

In short, the person who asked you to stop is the dick in this situation, NOT OP. ",-12,0,1444261258,1444722532
cvrvpig,0,t1_cvrtxni,NothingCrazy,"You could walk on to a train full of people and announce that Hitler had it right all along, and some handful of them would agree. Some people just have a sour disposition about literally everything. 


People tend to be react negatively to anything they don't understand. Who cares what they think? More inquisitive, curious, and interesting people will like you for speedcubing. The people that are cunts about it... well, you didn't want anything to do with them anyway, most likely. ",5,0,1444260507,1444722532
cvrvgoj,0,t1_cvru9p1,NothingCrazy,"How, exactly? My Moyu Aolong is practically silent when lubed properly. My cubing with that is no more or less distracting or annoying than someone surfing the web on their phones. It's not my problem if someone doesn't want to see a cube moving in their field of vision (which is the only option left to annoy them, if you rule out sound.) 

Keep cubing OP. Some people are just touchy to the point of neurosis. You can't base what you do off what other people don't like, or you'll find yourself doing literally nothing but sitting perfectly motionless and staring straight forward while breathing as quietly as humanly possible.
