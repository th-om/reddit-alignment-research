cv2y360,1,t3_3l2tbr,Arryth,  First of all - good on you for your victory.  Colony Collapse disorder has been a concern of mine for a long time.  How much of an effect will this have on the loss of bees problem?  Are there other factors in play with this phenomenon?  Are certain gmo crops also connected to Colony Collapse Disorder?,1,0,1442361154,1444728664
cv2xra3,0,t1_cv2web5,Arryth,"  Tax is not theft.  If you think you will not at some point will never need health care, you are delusional.  It is no more theft then me having to pay money for the military, fire department, police, or any of a plethora of services.  Some I agree with some I do not.  None of them do I have a choice in.  You want facts...  Fact - Untreated poor are germ factories where the rise of novel infections can come from and spread to the rest of us. Fact - Untreated working poor are a drain on our economy because they can not work as effectively at their jobs, and as a bonus can spread their illness to the rest of us.  Fact - Treating illness late is much more expensive then treating it early.  Using the ER as a doctors office because they must treat you is insanely expensive, a cost your taxes will pay for like it or not.  I am not Marxist for simply caring about my fellow human beings.  A great deal of what the US Government is socialist in some form or another.  I have no problem with some socialism.  Mixed systems seem to work the best in the real world.  On a final note - you don't get the right to chose to participate - a quarantine for example is something that exists that is absolutely mandatory when declared.  It does not invade your body.  You can refuse treatment if you chose to be a fool.  I'm done arguing with you as some one who thinks its ok to let a countrymen die if they can not afford medical care, as not some one I want to converse with.  You are not interested in solutions, you are just salty about the ACA existing.  You don't care wither or not it does any good.",-4,0,1442360563,1444728664
cv2wxjt,0,t1_cv2on5v,Arryth,"  Honestly it wont work.  Single payer with realistic cost controlls, subsidization of expensive medical equipment, and bulk bargining power of a united entity is probably the only solution that would truly work.  Add to that standardization across the states, and science based proof of effectiveness reviewing all procedures and drugs would also help.  We currently see new drugs pushing out older drugs that worked better in some cases.  Newer is not always better.  There are an awful lot of middle men that need to be removed, and the funds saved could provide more medical personnel.  Another idea is Federally funded medical and nursing training.  Especially for general family doctors.  ",0,0,1442359088,1444728664
cv2wkho,0,t1_cv2nf2d,Arryth,"  They are bad at it.  I site the gross mismanagement of Medicare and Medicaid between states.  All must have it, but some states do it quite well, others are awful at managing it.  It is used as a political tool.  I so wish we could take medical care out of politics, just agree every one gets it, period, fund it and fight over something else.  We are all humans, all of us will eventually get sick, most of us will need health care.  Cost cutting measures, the ability to bargain for bulk discounts on drugs, and standardization of care in all 50 states are things that should be looked into.  The mix of insurance companies and hospitals having to play their shell game with prices with each other is a problem also.  These are the things need to be addressed.",2,0,1442358450,1444728664
cv2w9xt,0,t1_cv2oaf7,Arryth,"  The VA is chronically underfunded.  I thought this was common knowledge?  The defense department keeps spending money on things it does not need, and in some case does not want (like more tanks it is forced by congress to keep buying) , so its budget to fund the VA is squeezed.  Typically a VA hospital is worse then a State hospital, or Private hospital.  It is kind of a travesty that the VA is allowed to be so poor.  The fault lays with Congress.",5,0,1442357931,1444728664
cv2w3wl,0,t1_cv2vp03,Arryth,"  You are welcome to believe what you like. You know damn well though that I am correct.  People will die with out the protections the ACA provides, just like they did day in and day out before the ACA became law.  There was a reason so many people supported the law, and so many more are beginning to support it.  Life with out medical insurance sucks.  The fear of not being able to get basic treatment when your working poor is awful.  The bill is not perfect, but it is better then the old system by allot.  Any one who has lived poor, or been sick with out insurance knows this.  Pile what ever delusions you must into your argument, but ethically you are wrong.  For the health of our country you are wrong, and from the stand point of keeping a productive, and more efficient work force you are wrong.  Adequate affordable health care is a must.  I dare say it is a right.",-6,0,1442357640,1444728664
cv2voa5,1,t3_3l26yu,Arryth,"  And people wonder why I say school is for socializing your child, and you need to teach them the things they need to know your self.  We don't home school, but I do lessons on every thing from health, to math, science and history for my children.  No school can substitute for the education a parent can impart, assuming, you as a parent are educated.  On a side note, do all you can to make your children think of reading as fun, not a chore.  Reward and encourage curiosity and study.  The only stupid question is the one not asked.",3,0,1442356886,1444728664
cv2vftz,0,t1_cv2ua42,Arryth,"No i'm cutting straight to the heart of it.  You know that removing the ACA will kill other human beings.  If you chose to do it any way, You are for letting other human beings die.  There is not logical way around the issue if all the bull shit is stripped away.   I will tell you a story from my own life.  When I was 6 years old I developed a strep infection in a cut on my arm caused by a neighborhood kid who hit me with a stick and cut me.  It spread over the next week into my blood stream giving me scarlet fever.  We could not afford a doctors visit, we especially could not afford a hospital visit.  It was not until I was to the point of dying that I was finally taken to the hospital and they begrudgingly treated me for the infection. No one would treat me until it was life threatening because my family was poor whites in an area devastated by the 1987 recession. The cost? $14,600 in 1987 dollars.  If they would have had to treat me by law at the doctors office it would have been a three dollar medication via injection.  The ""market driven"" way of doing things almost claimed my life.  I am now a Nurse Practitioner who services at need areas.  I tell you from the front line that the ACA is a saver of a lives, and only a savage would tolerate its repeal with out all the protections built into it enshrined into law.  No one, especially a child should have to die from lack of basic medical care.  Any nation where that happens is not worth existing.",-7,0,1442356487,1444728664
cv2ui07,0,t1_cv2knvq,Arryth,"  Up vote because you are correct.  In my state for example we are already seeing costs drop significantly because simple thing are not taken to the ER, and thing that should have been treated early are not left untreated until they become a true emergency.  The ACA may not be perfect but I am utterly unwilling to let it go until another better bill is in place.  No repeal and then replace.  It has to be ready to go on day one of the repeal.  Any thing else is a farce.",1,0,1442354881,1444728664
