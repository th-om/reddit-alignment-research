Also, it's odd that you say that immigration is a small problem in the grand scheme of things, then in the next paragraph mention that the overall world population should be managed. If you believe this, then each sovereign nation should control for population on an individual level, not globally where it is harder to manage. Because if we have an open-border libertarian wet dream, the economies that have thrived this century will be succumbed to unfettered immigration and will ultimately have a large crisis on their hands. Just look at Germany, the state is confiscating the homes of German citizens to give to migrants. As a big believer in property and rental rights, I find this absolutely unheard of, and a disgrace.

Full disclosure: I live in a sanctuary city (an area with the highest concentration of them in the nation, actually). Our hospitals are pretty damn swamped, and quite a few nurses have changed professions because they can't handle the load and stress, and neither can the hospital infrastructure as a whole. Hispanics who have been in this area for decades think it's ridiculous and they complain about the illegal immigrants because it means those coming legally will have a tougher time.

We are told that we require this immigration for the growth of our economy, but by keeping the H1-B wage artificially low compared to market price, Americans have to compete for lower wages for a job that *should* pay more with free-market prices. Immigrants gained 14000 jobs last month, native-born lost 262.000 jobs and counting.

We talk about our crippling infrastructure and how our current roads cans handle the load of traffic in many major cities without inordinate commute times. We talk about being $19T plus in debt and nobody seems to have done anything serious about actually reducing that debt, meaningfully. Do you think this is possible with unfettered immigration continuing unabated?

While I agree that we should consider new energy sources, a complete overhaul too quickly without perfecting energy storage for solar and wind will cripple third world economies, who right now, require cheap oil products to kick-start their growth (if a global recession or WW3 don't start in these coming months, which is quite likely).

Nobody is talking about nuclear energy in a serious manner, and I believe that would be our absolute best bet to become energy-independent. You say Democrats are the best hope for that, but Republican support for nuclear energy expansion beats Democrats 2:1 at 47% support to Dems 24% support as of March.

This is absolutely something she would brag about. Notice how much of a reach it was, ""greatest accomplishment"" is cheating on a boyfriend? Status boosting, plain and simple. Good for her I guess, though the backlash has seemed pretty rough. 

She's trying to kickstart an acting career, what better way than pro athlete sex affair controversy?

cvminxj,0,t1_cvmfw2v,itssexytime,"We can go back and forth all day, I can post studies from Harvard, Duke, and other reputable universities that state that gun control has no effect on murder rate one way or another, and you'll find some from ThinkProgress that state the opposite. What I do know is that if we banned guns, criminals would still get them. You can 3D print most parts for a firearm and assemble it in your garage if you are determined enough. Or you can buy them black market. Either way, you can have a populace able to defend itself against violent criminals, which happens quite often, or you can have people fending for themselves.

 I think it is a cop out to laugh when somebody states something along the lines of ""if more people had concealed carry, less lives would have been lost."" Some people think that multiple CCers would just start firing blindly like madmen when engaging a hostile, but this isn't the case. Proper gun courses teach one to never engage with your firearm unless it is a last resort and your firing line is clear. Here is a 71 year old man demonstrating on armed criminals that posed a threat to patrons: http://youtu.be/dwrgvqlc8DA
Notice his poise, control, and alertness. He had an open line of fire, and neutralized the immediate threat. Here is a man saving himself and his significant other from a man breaking into his house with machete: http://youtu.be/5bsAMSQ13bY. No other weapon could have provided these people with the necessary protection to not be harmed in this situation (besides a door that wasn't made out of cardboard I suppose). 

The real problem isn't guns. It is a combination of two factors: lack of mental health spending/infrastructure and gang culture. Our mental health system is pathetic compared to some European countries. Also, if you were to remove gang violence (especially black gang violence) from statistical analysis, American gun homicides would not be inordinate and in fact, would be similar to some European countries. Note what I said earlier: these criminals would get guns regardless, whether they're illegally funneled from another country, or stolen, or home-made. Here is a good (albeit admittedly conservatively-biased) piece with relevant DOJ and FBI statistics describing how prevalent and out of control gang violence really is: http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/171576/america-doesnt-have-gun-problem-it-has-gang-daniel-greenfield

Now, I'm all for background checks and increased mental health spending. What I absolutely do not want to see is knee-jerk reactionary legislation and blaming solely the firearm. McVeigh used fertilizer, BTK used plastic bags. There are shitty people everywhere, you can't change human nature. But you can ensure that you and your family are secure, and that's what this comes down to at the end of the day. Blaming guns is an excuse to not address our moral failures and lack of healthcare prioritization. ",2,0,1443850111,1444732114
