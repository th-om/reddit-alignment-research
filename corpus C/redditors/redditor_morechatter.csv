cvx5lcq,1,t3_3odpun,morechatter,"You used the term broadcast and a budget of $50k in the same question. I think those are diametrically opposing thoughts. =)

But in all seriousness, consider what is your actual goal? Streaming a bunch of academic lectures & conferences doesn't require broadcast quality/cost equipment. You've already invested in 4K stuff but are you putting that quality out to the stream and do you even need that quality? (The rest of this comment is more for discussion purposes than steering you in any direction. You already have a ton of equipment that makes my comments unnecessary at this time.)

Had you considered something like the NewTek TriCaster line of switchers? I like them because of their all-in-one concept. Cameras connect direct to the unit, single computer monitor display shows all sources, and it records and encodes the stream. Simple from a setup viewpoint.

Cameras: this gets tricky based on beauty in the eye of the beholder. I can talk to my bosses all day about why an expensive camera is better than a handycam, but they simply like the image from the handycam enough to save multi-thousands of dollars per camera. Because it looks good enough on the live stream. That said, I also have a rig that uses the Panasonic AW-HE130 ($8k each) PTZ cameras with remote controller (new model is Panasonic AWRP50NJ at $2k) and that has been great. One camera op controls up to 5 cameras.

In the meantime I find usefulness in every comment on this thread except yours. Especially the ones you would expect me to hate. Those are the comments that help give depth conversations.

My comparison wasn't about beating the child, it was about delivering an unacceptable punishment simply because another person does something completely expected. Is it right to do what you promised, even if it is wrong, as a reaction to an expected action?",0,0,1443618865,1444722220

Not to say the alternative wasn't a bad idea, but it was very partisan how that budget line was cut.

In the spirit of negotiation for a better outcome, that decision should have involved a lot more public discourse. ",1,0,1443618201,1444722220
