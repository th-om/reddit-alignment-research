They didn't and couldn't take video constantly from launch to landing. Here's a NASA collection of video that they do have: http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=10451

I don't know if that's everything, but it's a lot.

From NASA's New Horizons Twitter account:

""There is a false rumor going around that there will be a BIG New Horizons science announcement tomorrow. Completely false.""

Nothing that they want to say is huge, but they did find that Pluto has a blue sky and RED water ice. Weird.",7,0,1444336728,1444724932

The black population in the U.S. has a higher crime rate, and also has a higher poverty rate. Some folks like to argue that the higher crime rate must mean that black people are just inherently criminals. That's very wrong.",1,0,1444028972,1444724932
