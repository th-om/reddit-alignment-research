Listen to what you are saying?  You want basic services to be paid for in the stingiest, greediest way instead of by an entity with essentially unlimited money.  And as a convenient side effect, prices for the poor might go **up** (the rich buy a lower fraction of their goods from MW workers, mind you).  

How is that good for the poor again?",0,0,1444419689,1444730038

cvswoox,1,t3_3o01nd,plexluthor,"I used to campaign for global thermonuclear warfare as a sort of reset button on humanity.  Annihilate all the existing infrastructure and the vast majority of the people, and surely we'd be better off once we were done rebuilding.  In my fantasy, there is enough build-up and warning that no significant knowledge is lost.  Many cultures would essentially be lost, but presumably some diversity would remain.

I think in that fantasy scenario, we would need a very long time to rebuild and would have to deal with the literal fallout for several decades at least, but that our grandchildren or maybe their grandchildren would indeed be better off.

However, a little reality makes me less sure this is good.  For starters, it seems extremely likely that many of the people most likely to survive are the ones already screwing up our current society.  There would be a great deal of psychological trauma as people died from basic diseases that were virtually unheard of pre-war.  Without serious fantasy-level preparation, influenza or some bacterial infection might be devastating.

And historically, I'm not sure that WWI can really take credit for any of the prosperity that followed.  It seems like a lot of that was inevitable with the march of progress.  WWII and the cold war probably did do a lot of good, though.

Anyway, nowadays I fantasize about colonizing Mars or the Moon instead.",3,0,1444336402,1444730038

cvrx44i,0,t1_cvrn0pv,plexluthor,"> Note that that the decade 200x is basically a lost decade of investing.

That might be true for people no longer accumulating, but I doubt it.  Retirees were presumably diversified into bonds, and a 50/50 stock/bond split should have come out positive over that decade.  And certainly people like me who were accumulating during that decade ended it with much more than simply the sum of their deposits.

A quick Google search turned up this, which seems to confirm my intuition, though maybe international diversification was necessary for the retirees.

And please don't claim that anytime the government changes the tax code it's a major financial disaster, but any government policies that influence the other 9 recessions are categorically different.  If you do, I'm going to argue that the stagflation of the 60s is indirectly responsible for the government policies that led to the savings and loan crisis, and then the supposed 40 year gap in financial disasters is cut in half and things look pretty consistent.",1,0,1444262759,1444730038
