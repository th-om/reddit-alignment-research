> We should balance our budget to avoid this disaster.

doesn't follow from this:

> In something like 10 years America is going to fall into a fiscal pit because of SS, medicare, medicaid, and and interest on the debt.

If Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are insolvent in the long term, we should make the necessary adjustments to fix them, either on the revenue or benefit ends.  From what I understand, fixing SS requires only minor adjustments; Medicare requires somewhat more work due to the Baby Boomers aging.  Hell, we can have a discussion about whether these programs should be phased out as an ideological point if you want; it's a valid position to hold.

In 2013 (the last year I could easily find data for, but I think very reasonably recent), interest on the debt was 6% of federal outlays, or about 1.25% of GDP.  I have absolutely no clue why you would lump this in with the others.  We could borrow several times the amount we currently do and be at a perfectly healthy national debt level (I'm not advocating for this, as it's unnecessary and could cause other problems depending on how it's done).

National finances are not like household finances.  Balancing the budget is not a solution to the problems you describe, and would have negative repercussions on the economy due to reduced liquidity.",8,0,1444400923,1444723982
