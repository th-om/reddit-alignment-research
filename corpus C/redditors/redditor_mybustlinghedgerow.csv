cvpe09j,0,t1_cvpb2a3,mybustlinghedgerow,"Huh. I evaluate kids under the age of 3, and one of the things we test 2.5 year olds on is whether or not they intentionally try and make people laugh, since it's considered developmentally appropriate.

cvlzylo,0,t1_cvl001r,mybustlinghedgerow,"I work with infants and toddlers with developmental delays, and I'd recommend staying away from MJ while pregnant/breastfeeding. It can mess with a kid's attention and memory, and although you usually don't see any negative effects right after birth, it can lead to delayed development/missed milestones later on. Also, CPS will take the kid away if they test positive, at least in the US.",1,0,1443812900,1444731164

My mom got kicked out because she was seen being friends with a black man and because she didn't ""submit"" to a guy who was bullying her in her theater classes. It's a stupid, stupid school. My cousin goes there now, and she got a pin after her first year that says ""first BJ."" Lol.",15,0,1442952354,1444731164
cuy9jai,0,t1_cuwlcj9,mybustlinghedgerow,It's a legitimate comparison because in the supreme court has ruled that it is unconstitutional to outlaw both interracial marriage and gay marriage. So in both cases the clerk would be violating the law and denying people something that the courts have ruled they have a right to. Similar doesn't mean the exact same.

And if there ends up being a religion that requires wearing only underpants, courts would probably be able to gauge how that affects others using testimony and such. 
Kim Davis's case is definitely more cut and dry, of course. I can't imagine someone would actually try and say she wasn't directly affecting people by denying them marriage licenses or by forcing them to not do their job.",1,0,1442000317,1444731164
