See how you can make that little phrase work for just about any situation? It's also not exactly true to say that personal honesty has little to do with politics. It's hugely important. People like candidates that they can trust.

I really wasted my time with my previous response. It's clear you have been done some sort of brain damage with your youthful drinking. More evidence to not drink if college I guess :)",1,0,1444412069,1444723744
cvtuo8y,0,t1_cvtu2u7,Barefoot_Raphsode,"Judging from how angry you have gotten. I think I am 100% justified in wanted you avoid you.

You sound like you belittle those who choose to do something other than what you you yourself enjoy. That right there is a problem. I'm gonna guess you're sober right now. I can''t imagine you drunk. Yikes. 

That in addition to your need to call me ignorant and an asshole just furthers that assumption.

Further more, you really shouldn't just link the first google search. According to the National institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's report  says

>According to a national survey, almost 60 
percent of college students ages 18âˆ’22 report drinking alcohol in the past month.
[Source](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/CollegeFactSheet/CollegeFactSheet.pdf)

So it's only 60% of kids who have had a drink in the last month. 

That all being said. I'm a grown ass adult. I drink most nights after my job. And if you actually knew anything about the real world, you would know that a TON of Mormons (and my extension BYU) love to drink, hard. Most of them come from super strict houses and lose control in college. My best friend growing up was Mormon, went to BYU and drank almost every night. He ended up gaining a bunch of weight and now doesn't drink that much anymore. Every time you reply, you just end up being wrong about more and more things. It's like being in college again, so thanks for reminding my why I was so happy to graduate.

Said every kid who later went to AA.

>At least 80% of college kids drink

So wrong lol. 

>I'm guessing you're either a mormon or BYU student

Yes. Those are the only kinds of people who don't drink. Good job! 

Edit:

>""I have friends who just so happen to enjoy drinking. I also have friends who do not enjoy drinking.""

That nice, but wait what's this?

>""All of my friends and I love drinking at bars and getting drunk""

Hmm....
