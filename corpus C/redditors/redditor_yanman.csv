Still might take a month or two to get fully resolved, but the charge won't effectively be on their account until if/when the merchant successfully gets the dispute overturned.",41,0,1444584880,1444732056
cvvyaok,1,t3_3ob682,yanman,"I have an 07 Type-S and have driven the base.  The biggest operation differences are (in order of impact): the suspension, transmission and engine.  Otherwise, it's really just appearance; especially if you get the red or blue paint that were exclusive to the Type-S.

If appearance matters to you and if you want to be able to throw the car around corners and/or stomp on the gas occasionally, get the Type-S.

If you're not going to drive aggressively, you probably won't appreciate the differences.  In fact, you might not even notice the differences except perhaps the transmission shifts which a meek driver might consider too jarring in the Type-S.

cvker60,1,t3_3n2l46,yanman,"According to the owner's manual:  Your Acura is designed to operate on unleaded gasoline with a pump octane number of 91 or higher.  Use of a lower octane gasoline can cause occasional metallic knocking noises in the engine and will result in decreased engine performance.

Personally I wouldn't want to risk damaging my engine, damaging my emission controls, and over-polluting just to save $2 a tank current prices.
