Your theory.

> Scalia himself referenced M-16a number of times in the Heller decision...

... and nothing in his decision explicitly says AWBs are constitutional. Nor does he say that M-16s are ""dangerous and unusual.""

He lays out the tests for the 2nd Amendment, and applies it to the firearms at issue (handguns). Anything beyond that is speculation.

Even Scalia speculates on this point:

cvvd7bm,0,t1_cvvczob,RoundSimbacca,">  dangerous and unusual is what allows government the right to regulate things like magazine size, caliber, barrel size, and speed of actuation

That's what the government *claims*, at any rate- the government typically says lots of silly things at court too- like when it said that you had no right to use a gun to defend yourself, or that you can't speak on political matters around election day.

The Supreme Court has the opportunity to clarify this issue. It's not inconceivable that commonly owned arms, no matter the particulars of barrel, magazine size, etc. are beyond government prohibition.

Not at the Supreme Court, they haven't. *Miller* never finished. No AWB has ever been heard under the 2nd Amendment pre- or post-*Heller*.",0,0,1444527057,1444717372

Dicta. Also, this isn't a carry case. He's explicitly saying that here.

>> ...oganized militia is the sole institutional beneficiary of the Second Amendment ’s guarantee—it does not assure the existence of a “citizens’ militia” as a safeguard against tyranny...

Irrelevant to your refutation of my point.

>> ...The Constitution leaves the District of Columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem, including some measures regulating handguns....

Such as background checks. It isnt to be read as allowing government to do whatever they want, as it's conceivable that other portions of the opinion limit the ""tools"" available even though they are short are short of a blanket prohibition on handguns or a complete ban on using firearms to defend yourself. Scalia's rationale logically foreclose blanket bans on long guns.

The gun that Heller owned, the same one that the Supreme Court ordered the District of Columbia to allow him to register, was an 11-shot revolver, iirc.

In fact, only two tests are given in *Heller* on the kinds of arms protected:
