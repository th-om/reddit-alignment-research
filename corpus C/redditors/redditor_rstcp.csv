cvw55ks,0,t1_cvw3gci,rstcp,"Fair enough. But I have to say, I live in a country with closed list PR, and the strength of the party generated by the ability of the leadership to pick candidates is also offset by other features of our politics. Votes in parliament can be done by headcount, which often results in rebels voting against the party. Nothing the party can do about that until the next election, and even then, if their minority voice is popular among the base, the party would hurt itself trying to demote the members. This is because it's very easy in a PR system to have multiple parties. Also, MPs can and do defect their parties and retain their seat all the time, allowing them to launch a new party and splinter the old one in time for the next election and with guaranteed funding.

He was very involved in FP for both terms, and often got his way. He also has relationships with international leaders going back decades, and he is a little less hawkish than Hillary.
