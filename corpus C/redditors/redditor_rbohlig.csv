I think that's a good requirement, the only problem I can see arising from it is not every OP will be able to participate immediately following the post. What sort of time limitations would be imposed for participating? ",6,0,1443993261,1444718940

If you don't agree or feel that my comment doesn't add to the dialogue, feel free to downvote. Judging by the upvotes though it appears my sentiment is shared.",1,0,1443992557,1444718940
cvo6pap,0,t1_cvo5qh2,rbohlig,"I agree, I guess I should have said it differently. Originally the BOR wasn't even going to be a part of the constitution. It was only added to satisfy the anti-federalists.

""The government could never do what it was not explicitly authorized to do, they argued. Therefore, things like speech and religion were safe. A listing of rights, moreover, could be dangerous, leading to the erroneous conclusion that only those rights specifically listed were actually protected. Furthermore, most states already had bills of rights; a federal list would be redundant.""

What I was implying is that I doubt any of the founders would suggest altering the BOR, those 10 amendments are timeless and outline natural rights. OP made it sound like Jefferson would be in favor of eliminating or changing the BOR.

More clear?

cvo4gfu,0,t1_cvo11zq,rbohlig,"The founders gave us the ability to adapt and change, that you are correct about. But to say that it SHOULD be changed is disingenuous. The bill of rights was never intended to be changed, those 10 amendments are essential for a free society. 

The bill of rights is not the constitution.  ",7,0,1443988997,1444718940
cvo48yi,0,t1_cvo1p3g,rbohlig,"> I would argue semi automatic at the very least should be banned

Because OP clearly has no idea what he/she is talking about. They don't even know what a semi automatic weapon is. (hint nearly every gun today is semi-auto, 1 bullet per 1 pull of the trigger)
