cuxr1d6,1,t3_3ki5sz,2chainz2stainz,Trump doesn't have a chance. He'll get far but he won't win. He's pretty much crystalized that outcome for himself.,2,0,1441964457,1444730284
cudt6de,1,t3_3i6y7x,2chainz2stainz,"I lean nowhere towards the right nor do I like Hillary, however I do find the whole scandal suspicious. I have noticed that right wing media certainly pays a lot of attention to it but that isn't surprising. Personally, thats just what Ive been seeing though.",16,0,1440419101,1444730284

ct57rsk,0,t1_ct56y22,2chainz2stainz,"I have read the deal which is why I'm confused as to why so many people are up in arms about it lol. The deal requires Iran to give up 97% of their Uranium, drop 15K of their centrifuges (20K to 5K), and limit their Uranium enrichment up to only 3.67%. Roughly 20% of enrichment is required for research grade purposes and 90% is required for weapons grade purposes... they only have a 3.67% enrichment cap which is just enough for energy production. But then there are 'critics' who will scrutenize the effectiveness of IAEA in monitoring Iran; however people seem to have forgotten the IAEA is who found out about Iran's covert nuclear research in the first place lol. 

The deal essentially strengthens relationships-hopefully changing attitudes, opens more geographical fronts, and benefits the global economy; while also limiting any, if not all, of their nuclear capabilities. So the fear-mongering just needs to stop.",24,0,1437043753,1444730284
ct56h8c,0,t1_ct5698x,2chainz2stainz,"The possibility is slim. Even if Iran decided to do something hasty, I doubt it'd go overlooked by an ally, let alone any advanced nation. The new deal honestly seems fine and certainly considers future development. People just need to turn down the fear-mongering dial a bit.",14,0,1437038322,1444730284

csvntqi,0,t1_csvmbd2,2chainz2stainz,"Sanctuary City - A term given to a city in the US or Canada that follows certain practices that protect illegal immigration. These practices can be by law or they can be by habit. The term generally applies to cities that do not allow municipal funds or resources to be used to enforce federal immigration laws, usually by not allowing police or municipal employees to inquire about an individual's immigration status.

Hence why SF and ICE did not cooperate.",2,0,1436316619,1444730284
csv0hf0,0,t1_csuvhf8,2chainz2stainz,"The reason why the man wasn't apprehended was because SF is a sanctuary city... ICE had warrants of their own and made a request to the city to have him detained but they had no jurisdiction because the city had no warrant of their own to detain him. To detain him merely by ICE's request would have been illegal under the policies of SF. It was actually because of SF's policies that this crime took place.

However, it is reasonable to question the effectiveness of our border control considering the man was already deported five times previously.",8,0,1436281187,1444730284
cstzuer,0,t1_cstugqg,2chainz2stainz,"You can't use that video to make a generalization of Bernie voters. This is like me using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za3pyzGGb1w) to generalize Republican voters. I'd rather not entertain insulting voter groups.

Why are you comparing clearly illogical individuals in the Congressional Science Committee with Bernie who was on the the Senate Budget Committee? Mind you, these individuals you are referring to were/are Republicans who actually [held back the the committee](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/06/house-science-climate-budget_n_7225848.html) with very weird dissonant views. Lets not compare different individuals with different views, let alone in different committees.
Furthermore, for the fact that he was a *ranking* member of the Senate Budget Committee certainly qualifies him to know about US economics, as he was someone who they appointed to budget congress on specific issues. If you really want to disprove his qualification then simply provide credible evidence that says otherwise. Sound easy enough?

The part where you mention private sector makes me laugh. What exactly would you like Bernie to do for the private sector? An even better question, what more do you want done for the private sector?
Reagan [reduced marginal tax rate on income from labor and capital, reduced regulation, reduced growth of government spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_policy_of_the_Ronald_Reagan_administration#Policies), and best of all his war on labor, and disrespect for unions. Leaving an unambiguous signal that employers need feel little or no obligation to their workers. Bill Clinton signed in [NAFTA/CAFTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Bill_Clinton#First_term.2C_1993.E2.80.931997) which positively influenced trade and foreign direct investment, although 700,000 jobs were lost to cheaper labor in Mexico. But its ok, because the private sector still profits from cheaper labor, yay! Oh, and lets not forget the [repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Legislation) during the Clinton administration, which deregulated Wall Street. More specifically, took away limitations on commercial and investment banking, which actually [aided their habits that led to the 2008 recession](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/08/27/repeal-of-glass-steagall-caused-the-financial-crisis). But its ok, because private sector industries, specifically banks and insurance companies, made 'hella' profits. These same profits which Bernie is referring to when he discusses income inequality. But hey, hes crazy anyway right? Hes a socialist for christ sake! But now we get to George W. Bush, where he implemented his [Bush-era tax cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts) that everyone knows benefited the private sector and Obama even extended the Bush-era tax cuts in his first term! So please, tell me more about how we need more done for the private sector.

And now we move on to your example of Detroit, which also makes me laugh, because you're seriously claiming Bernie would be a precursor for another Detroit lol. Do you even know what happened in Detroit? The reason for Detroit's decline was partly due to the automobile industry [moving manufacturing jobs out to Mexico and Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Detroit#Role_of_the_automobile_industry). This also goes without mentioning Detroit's [1967 riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Detroit#Economic_and_social_fallout_of_the_1967_riots), which were a major contribution to their economic and social decline. BTW theirs an ELI5 on Detroit's decline as well.

Like do you people just blurt out reasons without doing actual research. To think you're actually going around making these deceptive arguments. Shame on you!",1,0,1436203614,1444730284
