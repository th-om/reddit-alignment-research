cvw6h8s,0,t1_cvw5jpc,spidermonk,"I agree, that seems totally reasonable. I'm not 100% confident in the stuff that goes into flavours, or completely confident in the construction of replaceable atomizers, but yeah, I'm pretty damn confident that vaping is very safe overall.

I guess I'm just wary of the way cults can form around this kind of thing, which drown out questions which, outside of 'the enthusiasts bubble', are possibly raising real issues.",1,0,1444596073,1444729601
cvw5f3u,0,t1_cvw55q8,spidermonk,"Again, I don't think vaping is carcinogenic, but there are definitely things which are only carcinogenic once they get into the lungs right? Like, isn't pretty much anything that's both insoluble and really tiny carcinogenic if it's inhaled? Like talc, carbon black, asbestos etc.

My Sigelei/Herakles is sitting on my desk right now, but I want to know for sure how safe vaping is. Not just handwave every objection for potentially flawed reasons.",1,0,1444594503,1444729601

cvw4zqy,0,t1_cvw4hbp,spidermonk,"Doesn't potential long term unknown effects describe what happened with pretty much every human carcinogen ever? I think vaping is pretty safe, but it seems weird to discount unknown long-term effects for novel uses of novel substances by humans, as if those never crop up.",3,0,1444593874,1444729601
cvw4x5l,0,t1_cvw3qvc,spidermonk,"So what you're getting at, is that the conclusion is really more like:

""Assuming that there isn't some currently unknown-to-science, unique-to-VG/PG, long-term incremenetal harm to humans caused by VG/PG respiration, then vaping is 95% less harmful than cigarette smoking.""",8,0,1444593772,1444729601
cvuk1p0,0,t1_cvuhpuj,spidermonk,"Well yeah that would definitely be easiest. But there's a lot more to contributing to, and benefiting from, college than having good test scores. 

What's funny is how little friction you get, saying that there might be more to college admissions than grades, in response to a potential mono-asian harvard that excludes white people, but when you use the same logic in any other way, white people are stone cold numbers-based meritocrats.",1,0,1444455181,1444729601
