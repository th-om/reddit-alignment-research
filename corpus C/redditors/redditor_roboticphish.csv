cvx92v5,1,t3_3ogwc7,roboticphish,"I find my opinions on the external game of Melee changing frequently.  When I first started playing the game, and also when I'm just dickin' around and not really trying to do anything but look cool, I would taunt after every stock.  I'll go for the swaggiest option I can come up with, I'll trash talk my opponent, etc.  For me, that's all good fun and it shouldn't be taken seriously.

But as I got better and started taking myself and my gameplay more seriously, that kind of behavior was no longer fun for me.  If I'm playing seriously, I'm not going to taunt unnecessarily or go for like, jab punishes out of rest.  I'm trying to win, and I want my opponent to take the competition as seriously as I do.

The issue, of course, is that for some people ""taking it seriously"" directly correlates with ""doing literally everything that gives you an advantage in order to win"".  They'll deliberately taunt, run around the stage just f-smashing over and over again, and play as you might expect someone to play when they aren't being serious.

When someone did this to me, they lost my respect as a player and person.  They didn't get a handshake, I very frequently would run off and start spouting off about them, calling them several filthy names in the process.  It wasn't cool, it wasn't fun, it wasn't healthy, and ultimately it didn't affect my opponent in the slightest.  They walked away from the match feeling superior for winning, regardless of the gimmick they used to do it, and I walk away angry that my opponent couldn't even respect me enough to take the competition seriously.

Honestly, I wish I had some happy piece of advice at the end to tie it all together, but I don't.  Instead of getting angry now, I just give up.  I lose the match before I even sit down to play.  I don't want to deal with the antics of people who can't beat you without relying on outside factors.  Even if they *can* beat me without relying on outside factors, the fact that they don't even want to try just shows me they're chickenshit cowards who are afraid of pitting skill against skill alone and losing.

It should be pretty obvious that frustration/dealing with outside factors is by far my weakest point as a player.  It makes me wildly inconsistent, extremely salty (and thus not much fun when I'm losing), and at times a downright dick.  I'm at a point right now where it's difficult for me to even have fun with the game, so if there's anyone out there who has actual advice on this, I'd love to hear it.",2,0,1444678163,1444722434

cvx7ijt,0,t1_cvx577v,roboticphish,"I think the confusion is coming since I term embryos and zygotes to be human life forms.  Even though a zygote is a single cell, it is the whole human life form at that point in its development.  I might have given the wrong impression that I believe a red blood cell is a whole human being.  It is simply a part of a whole.  A zygote or embryo is a different story.  They *are* the whole.

cvw9sgu,0,t1_cvw825u,roboticphish,"Perhaps I need to expand my definition, then. A human life form is simply life which is strictly of the *homo sapiens* variety.  The zygote, while not nearly independent enough to survive on its own, is also human life.  It is the earliest part of the *homo sapiens* life cycle.

Your question, ""when can an aggregate of cells be called a human being"", was the original point of my post.  From connection of sperm meeting egg, a new congregate of 23 pairs of chromosomes is joined to create a new copy of the species.  Until the moment that all of the cells (I mean every single one) stop functioning, that is a unique human life form.

However, the discussion of when that aggregate of cells becomes a human being, insofar as it becomes a person, is the more philosophical debate I alluded to earlier.  It's entirely based on definition, and entirely arbitrary.  A human life form can die during menstruation, as a zygote which does not attach itself to the uterus cannot sustain itself and is washed away.  It is a relatively short life, but a unique life form nonetheless.  A zygote which gestates into a fetus before a miscarriage/abortion is a similar case, as is a child who dies in infancy, or a grown adult who dies for one reason or another.  They are all a unique life form in the *homo sapiens* species, with their own timeline.

As for legislating and arguing what constitutes a 'person' (or, as you're putting it, a human *being* as opposed to a human *life form*), that is entirely subjective and there is no correct answer.",1,0,1444601455,1444722434
cvw98b9,0,t1_cvw8mdi,roboticphish,"If, as you say, a dead human is still a human, why is an embryo (or to be more specific, a miscarried/aborted fetus) not afforded the same distinction?

Also, if you're making that distinction, it's completely arbitrary; at what point does a cluster of cells become a human? And upon what arbitrary criteria have you decided this?

In my definition, which I still argue is more correct, any dead matter which was previously a part of a living human is no longer human upon its death. So your sloughed off dead skin is no more human than the corpse in the ground.  It is not a living organism, it is decaying matter.  The distinction I make is between living and not living.  Regardless of *your* emotional instincts on the issue, an embryo is a living, functioning cell, whereas your dandruff or lopped off cells are not.

As far as I can tell, you are making a totally arbitrary distinction on what is and is not a human. Perhaps you can help me to understand why that's not the case.",1,0,1444600516,1444722434

cvw1b1e,0,t1_cvw0zgc,roboticphish,"Yeah, you're probably right; the unity of sperm and egg creates a new human organism, similar to how meiosis creates a new cell. Still, the original point was that it's all part of the human life cycle.",1,0,1444588356,1444722434
