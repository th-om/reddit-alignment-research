cvxj5ch,0,t1_cvxhg0o,tehfunnymans,"It's probably closer to option one than option two.  Few people realize that the president has little control over the economy.  Also, even if they wanted to vote based on the state of the economy, [partisans would be pretty bad at it.](http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2012/11/09/partisanship-shapes-beliefs-about-political-and-non-political-issues)  While they're more likely to know what's going on in politics - they care about it and therefore they pay attention to it - partisans are more likely to accept the arguments that their leaders make.  For instance, [they'll blame someone from the other party for high gas prices and then turn around and claim that the president has no control when their party takes over](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/05/09/152287372/partisan-psychology-why-are-people-partial-to-political-loyalties-over-facts).  

Even more interesting, [partisans respond more intensely to arguments if you tell them that there's disagreement between the parties.](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/pub/Druckman%20Peterson%20Slothuus%20APSR%202013.pdf)

cvxduo9,0,t1_cvx796x,tehfunnymans,">Since it was your risk of removing the pillar that caused the situation you are legally required to accommodate and care for the dependent party in your condo. 

The only way (that I can see at least) to reconcile this with libertarian principles is tort law.  My actions have harmed my neighbor and I therefore must make things right.  For this to apply to abortion, you must argue that conceiving a fetus harms it.  Taking something from not existing to existing does not seem like harming it to me.  

Or are you arguing that actions that make someone dependent on you obligate you to care for them?  How does that derive from commonly accepted tenets of Libertarianism? It seems to me like it would really undermine capitalism if that were the case.  If a drug company comes up with a treatment for a deadly disease, it has caused a situation in which a host of people are now dependent on it to survive, but libertarians don't say that it has to give away the drug for free if the patients cease payment.

cvx35ty,0,t1_cvx0mrs,tehfunnymans,">How does it follow that because nature spontaneously aborts unborn humans that we may deliberately kill them? People die of natural causes, but that does not justify murder.

>One hundred percent of all conceived embryos die at some point in the lives. Some die sooner rather than later, you and I have made it this far. Even if we could draw a moral conclusion from the percentage of embryos who survive until birth, it should be that life is even more precious than we thought. Embryos should be helped to survive, not have their lives cut short because other embryos don't survive past that point anyway.

This argument is generally incompatible with Libertarian thought.  Providing a social good is not enough to justify infringing someone's right to their property.  ",1,0,1444669591,1444716434
cvwzhux,0,t1_cvwwt2y,tehfunnymans,">if the woman is at risk of death obviously she has a right to end the pregnancy.

This is all pregnant women.  Although the risk is generally low, it is always present.  Although certain risk factors can be identified, many deaths occur for reasons that would be very difficult to foresee.  Infection, for instance, is [the third-highest cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States and 6% of those deaths are unexplained.](http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pmss.html)
