Until about five seconds ago, no.",1,0,1444700772,1444724324
cvxnt4z,1,t3_3oha8h,Kind_Of_A_Dick,"1.  [Size Enhancement](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Size_Enhancement).  The unfortunate thing is that I don't know exactly what height I'm limited to because the power is very broad, but growing to twenty or thirty feet tall is going to give me enough durability and strength to turn two xenos into puddles of acid.

2.  Add in [Hope Constructs](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Hope_Constructs).  I have the ability to turn into a giant, so I'd be able to probably summon enough hope to crush both opponents.

3.  Add in [Purgatory Lordship](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Purgatory_Lordship).  This helps not one single bit, but I'm still huge and wielding crazy constructs.  I don't know much about my opponents, but I think I could handle this with a liberal application of smashing everything in sight.

4. Add in [Jolt Inducement](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Jolt_Inducement).  I'm now a giant, wielding constructs, and able to shake my opponents like crazy and possibly screwing with them.  Vader is going to be incredibly difficult but I think I can take the Space Marine without an issue.  Being able to grow to 60ft and contain a spasming Vader in a construct container will probably get me the win.

5.  Add in [Earth Embodiment](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Embodiment).  This means I can control earth, become stone(or maybe even something stronger), create earth constructs, and it seems teleport through earth contact.  I can match Godzilla's size and strength with my growth and my other powers are going to make this fight comparatively easy.

6. Add in [Past Manipulation](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Past_Manipulation).  Well, this jumped me into a completely new category of power.  I'm not familiar with composite Samus, but I'm thinking my powers are more than a match for her.

7.  Add in [Universal Force Sealing](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Universal_Force_Sealing).  I'm not exactly sure what this power is able to do, but based on the variations it seems it is incredibly powerful if I have prep time.  I think I'm still good here.

8.  Add in [Nether Manipulation](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Nether_Manipulation).  Again, not quite sure what I can do with this but the applications listed show an incredible amount of power.  I don't know anything about Beerus, but I'm seeing myself as being able to destroy them.

9.  Add in [Broom Manipulation](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Broom_Manipulation).  This is incredibly useless, at least in this fight.  Still my previous rolls could take down an in-character Surfer.  A bloodlusted SS might be able to destroy me, but I'm seeing that past manipulation power being very useful here by changing his past so he doesn't become a herald.

10.  Add in [Stick Figure Physiology](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Stick_Figure_Physiology).  I don't see how this could be helpful, though it does give me options when fighting so I'm not always stone.  The previous Broom based power could give me the win by itself if Forerunners used broom.  Just imagine every broom in their civilization rising up and killing their owners.  Actually with past manipulation I could edit the history of the civilization so they love brooms, then I slay them all.


I became pretty powerful quite soon and think I could win all of these fights given what I rolled, though if those with more familiarity with the character from round 6 and later would be able to tell me whether or not I'd succeed.",2,0,1444700636,1444724324
cvx39py,0,t1_cvx1t39,Kind_Of_A_Dick,"The native Americans involved seem to consider it a highly offensive derogatory term.  Not all of them do but obviously enough to lobby for change.  But, similarly, while every black person doesn't find their derogatory term to be highly offensive I think we can both agree that a high school naming their team The Niggers with a black faced mascot would be an issue.  Remember this is only in public schools so I'm sure private sports teams are free to call themselves whatever their little hearts desire.",1,0,1444669753,1444724324
cvx2vts,0,t1_cvx12qu,Kind_Of_A_Dick,"Not that it would be a big deal if it was wine, but it looks like a cola in that glass.  The color is closer to cola plus the condensation on the glass means the liquid was likely cold or had ice added to it to make it cold.  Generally you don't do that to a red wine, though I could be mistaken.",22,0,1444669170,1444724324

cvwtey2,0,t1_cvwgsh4,Kind_Of_A_Dick,"Nope, Elvis.  He was so worshipped in his prime that he ascended to godhood then went back in time to ensure his own existence and creation by creating the universe in his image.  There is a heaven and it's a version of Graceland, where Elvis puts on concerts for his adoring fans.  When you get there all of your anger and hate melt away, leaving a joyous soul that enjoys the afterlife.  Also there's free fried chicken and cocaine for everyone.",0,0,1444650021,1444724324
