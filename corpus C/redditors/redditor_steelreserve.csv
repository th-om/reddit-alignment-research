cvi1dd1,1,t3_3mtgzd,steelreserve,">And it seems like that’s the same problem as the sunglasses you described. If we’re going to use them in the real world, don’t they all need to be interoperable?

>>Right. If you had two manufacturers and everyone’s walking around with augmented reality in the real world, half the people are dead to you.

This could be good for humanity. E.g. People can put on their glasses and not have to see the ""dead"" that don't use their brand. Maybe the Muhammad brand won't see the Jew brand as in their VRs.

Or it'll most likely be history repeating itself in the future. Instead of religious and political ideologies it'll be corporate brand loyalty. Unreal VR is my brand, therefore I hate Unity VR brand as I am suggested to do by according to mine and competitor brands. This could be an apex of capitalism as well as a regurgitation of darker human sociological tendencies.",2,0,1443533466,1444731818
cv59218,0,t1_cv55om7,steelreserve,"Good summaries, but I'm curious what kind of progress have you made in any of these platforms? 

I downloaded Unity a few weeks ago, did a couple of hours of tutorials and ended up making a ball fall onto a flat block (with a picture on it), then roll off and disappear. After that experience, I realized the amount of energy and time required to invest and decided I wouldn't continue. My only attempt was spurred by what I deem to be some excellent ideas for games and doing my own sort of graphics.",6,0,1442531262,1444731818

cuou47k,0,t1_cuo4ord,steelreserve,"I'm reading this now, after reading Kean's exceptional book The Disappearing Spoon. Did you know Napoleon's penis was stolen during his autopsy, smuggled into Europe by a crooked priest and eventually put up for sale in New York in 1927? One observer compared it to a ""maltreated strip of buckskin shoelace."" It had shriveled to an inch and a half. Despite this, a urologist in New Jersey purchased it for $2,900.

For OP I would recommend the book The Forest Unseen: A Year's Watch in Nature by David George Haskell not because it's an encyclopedia but it will certainly whet your appetite and knowledge for understanding the natural surrounding world on a smaller scale.",3,0,1441245041,1444731818
