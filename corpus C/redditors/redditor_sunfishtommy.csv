  That is not to say we are some war zone 3rd world country in Africa, but when you look at all the numbers and the data we actually look a whole lot more like Mexico than a country in Europe.  ",-3,0,1444702018,1444718678

I don't know what you are talking about, but with a hand crank flashlight you can crank for a minute and get like 5 or more minutes of light with multiple LED's.  With a bike you would be putting out way more power.  45 minutes of peddling seems like more than enough to power 10 - 20 hand crank flashlights for a day.",27,0,1444678699,1444718678

cvvt9rq,0,t1_cvvp25g,sunfishtommy,"I believe you are referring to this line.

>under the prevailing conditions of weather, wind, speed, and weight, the aircraft needed 5,300 feet of runway to stop safely.

This just means that after the NTSB got all their data together they calculated that the airplane would have needed 5300 feet to stop.  That information would not have been available to the pilots.  There is not some magic computer for the pilots that says when there is 1/2 an inch of snow on the ground a tail wind and we weigh this much that it will take exactly such and such feet to stop.  

They are able to estimate the necessary landing distance using weight and wind conditions, but it is possible that they did and it said they would have room.

As for the thrust reversers not working refer to this comment.

>Sometimes the levers for the thrust reversers do jam when you try to deploy them. Normally stowing the lever and trying again works but you're burning up runway while you do that. However I've seen them fail to work several times in a row on the same flight. Tried to use them while taxiing to the gate to see if they would work. Magically fixed themselves while we taxied to the gate. Worked fine after that. Maintenance couldn't find anything wrong with them.

I have read multiple times in this thread about how thrust reverser levers stick and then unstick themselves.  It is not ridiculous to believe that the captain tried it and it would not work, and then it works for the copilot a few seconds later.",5,0,1444573855,1444718678

cvvkeo4,0,t1_cvv9v06,sunfishtommy,"You don't know what you are talking about.    

You don't plop the plane down right at the very end of the runway you land in the touchdown zone which is typically 1000 feet down the runway.  In the case of Chicago Midway there is a displaced threshold meaning the runway for landing airplanes does not begin until even farther down the runway.  

From the Article

>the aircraft touched down in the touchdown zone of the runway with 4,500 feet of its 6,522-foot (1,988 m) length remaining

Meaning they landed exactly where they were supposed to.  

>[The] Pilot also lied about reverse thrusters

You completely made this up.  you have no proof that the pilot lied about the thrust reversers.  In fact the article even says

>The flying pilot (Captain) stated that he could not get the reverse thrust levers out of the stowed position. The first officer, after several seconds, noticed that the thrust reversers were not deployed, and activated the reversers without a problem.

There is no reason to believe that the captain lied about not being able to deploy the thrust reversers, and just because the co-pilot was able to deploy them does not mean that the captain is lying.",34,0,1444541561,1444718678

As for going around, that is super risky, and by the time they realized the thrust reversers were not working they might be too slow to take off before the end of the runway.",3,0,1444540938,1444718678
