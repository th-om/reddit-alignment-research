She was terrified to tell you because of the consequences, and the fact that she felt guilty just means she has normal human emotions - it certainly doesn't mitigate what she did in any way. I have a policy: no sympathy for people who don't come forward of their own volition to apologize. She wasn't sorry enough to risk losing the benefits of her actions.

There are a lot of reasons lawyers help. Go to /r/legaladvice sometime and look at all of the people who are *obviously* in the wrong, but who are so emotionally invested in the situation that they completely fail to see it. And even when a layman is legally in the right, they probably have no idea how to find authority that supports their position, have no idea which arguments might persuade a judge/jury, and are unable to generate a coherent and effective strategy.

>I'm allowed to not have a lawyer, but I then am not allowed the time to prep for the case because I do not have a law degree and I have to go by the courts time line.

cvxp0o6,0,t1_cvtwmh7,abk006,"> An M-16 is a fully automatic assault rifle, correct?

Burst-fire versions are much more common in the military than fully-automatic versions, but sure.

>And an AR-15 is basically an M-16 modified to be semi-automatic, correct?

Every civilian AR-15 was manufactured to be semi-automatic only. In fact, even if you had a full-auto sear, disconnector, and bolt carrier, it wouldn't fit in a regular, semi-automatic civilian AR-15. You'd need to re-machine the lower receiver for it to fit.

>So how is semi-automatic assault rifle not a logically coherent term for what it actually is?

Being *more* than semi-automatic is a defining feature of an assault rifle. Calling an AR-15 a ""semi-automatic assault rifle"" is like calling a hovercraft a ""wheel-less car"": it's not quite accurate and seems like a kind of ridiculous way to describe it if you know that a vehicle needs to have wheels in order to be a car.

Army doctrine centers around suppressive fire but single-shot accuracy is also necessary, so you need a rifle that can shoot in either semi-automatic or burst/auto (i.e. select-fire). If it does not have a burst/auto mode, it's simply not an assault rifle. The reason ""assault rifle"" is defined as it is, is because of the military utility of a rifle with *all* of those features.",1,1,1444702548,1444721107

They advertise it because the general public are responsible for electing people who will decide whether or not to buy their products. You might hear about that and think, ""Hey, that F-35 looks pretty cool. I'll vote for the guy who wants to buy more.""

But again, the point isn't that this particular type of ad is *desirable*; the point is that there's a lot of gray area when it comes to what is or isn't *political*. The ad didn't explicitly advocate for a certain candidate, party, or policy, and yet I'd consider it at least somewhat political.

This is sort of beside the point, but *no* media source is completely free from bias. The BBC is a reputable source, but it's still best to get news from a variety of sources from across the spectrum.

>I don't see it as hamstringing anyone, I see it as trying to put people on as equal a platform as possible.

Except there are two types of equality: equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. A proposal to disallow rich people from spending their money freely might give you a more equitable outcome, but you're treating those rich people unfairly (not giving them equal treatment in effect). 

In other words, you aren't giving them an equal *floor*, you're giving them an equal *ceiling*. 

>I mean, I know you're using an extreme for effect, but we're still a capitalist country, so no I wouldn't want to see that at all, and neither would the majority of people.

Things change. There need to be institutional safeguards in place *before* that happens, because it's much harder to put the genie back in the bottle than it is to just keep it in in the first place.

>Tyranny is when one person holds all the power, so how can the majority be a tyranny? 

""Tyranny"" just refers to absolute power used unjustly; there's no numerical component (as there is with ""dictatorship"" or ""oligarchy""). ""Tyranny of the majority"" is a pretty well-known term on this side of the pond; I think it was coined by Tocqueville (if you're interested in political theory, his ""Democracy in America"" is a pretty good read, and it probably articulates a lot of these concepts better than I can). It refers to the fact that, in a democratic society, majority groups have the power to impose their will on minority groups without the minority groups' approval. You're right that my Bill Gates example was purposely extreme (and would also be an illegal bill of attainder anyway), but this isn't just a hypothetical thing. I'm sure you're aware of America's sordid history when it comes to race relations; we used to have ""Jim Crow"" laws mandating segregation on the basis of race. They were instituted by a white majority against the black minority, and that's a perfect and terrible example of tyranny of the majority. ",1,0,1444353064,1444721107
cvswsuq,0,t1_cvsntdn,abk006,"> All political messages are to persuade someone of something, but when the information being given is presented in a way that is purposely misleading without being illegal (which I've seen numerous examples of from more than one country), then people will vote on things that they think they believe or trust, when in fact they shouldn't.

Well, I don't think we should even consider making political ads illegal for being misleading. It's impossible to be free from bias, and that's not even considering the difficulty in deciding what ads are political (Is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6L5J7WcUpo) political? It could certainly influence someone to vote for a candidate who wants to keep defense spending high.)

>And that's why I believe the rich elite have a huge advantage over everyone else, because money alone means they can influence a large amount of people and convince them of things that are not entirely true.

>But if the populace at large are benefiting, then each individual that makes up that populace are benefiting also. 

>But the general populace is made up of those individuals, it's not individuals vs the populace, they are one and the same, and taking power away from one, is taking it from both.



That's the fallacy of division; I think you're seeing ""the populace"" as a monolithic group, and it's not. Just because society as a whole is benefiting does not mean that each individual is benefiting. In fact, in your 'ideal scenario' (limiting the ability of rich people to buy ad time to propagate their political views) the government is intentionally hamstringing people above a certain level of wealth. That counts as a detriment to certain individuals, even though it might arguably benefit society as a whole.

> The purpose of a government (in my opinion) is to serve the people, if the people want a decentralised less influential government, they can vote to make that happen, if the people want social programs and security, they can vote for that, the people should get what they want and need.

Where does it end? If the ""people"" (i.e. some sort of majority) decide that they want to seize Bill Gates' wealth because it will benefit the population at large (by allowing them to fund social programs, etc), should they be able to? I don't think so. The government has to be limited to avoid the tyranny of the majority. That's what I mean when I say that the most important thing for a government is to avoid potential detriment to individuals: otherwise, you can use a sort of utilitarian morality system to justify literally any kind of government behavior. Taken to a logical extreme, that's what happened to the kulaks in the USSR: the government (acting in the name of the people) said that nationalizing and collectivizing farms would benefit society at large, so they committed genocide in order to enact those reforms.
