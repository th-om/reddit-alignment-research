1) Create legislation which requires colleges use older versions of textbooks. Not a whole lot has changed in any college subject at the undergrad level, and students don't need the newest versions of textbooks.    
2) Incentivize colleges to use sources like openstax.org  
3) Prohibit or curb the use of those online things offered through McGraw or Pearson. These can cost $100 and up.  

This is truly a problem which has already been solved. ",1,0,1444701327,1444726488
cvxjrpw,0,t1_cvxjad0,zusamenentegen,"unless the bill that was cosponsored passed, it's kind of meaningless. And even then it doesn't mean the cosponsor was integral. And then you have to have an argument about the bill itself. 

In addition what numbers are you looking at? I'm looking at sponsors: All, and then respectively cosponsor for both Clinton and Sanders. I'll reiterate that it's meaningless, but Clinton - 1950, Sanders - 5114",1,0,1444694377,1444726488

It will continue to be an uphill battle, but hopefully Bernie can help bring us home a win tomorrow. ",4,0,1444692481,1444726488

* She would had among the most influence of all US senators. We're talking about a former FLOTUS from a big state, not just any freshman senator. 
* She had spent 8 years as a party insider. 
* She was a moderate and should have had a much easier time passing things of note than he would have. 
* He was in the house for 2/3 of his congressional career, where it's harder to get things brought up for a vote at all. 
* He can at least make the claim he is a progressive independent, outside most congressional ideology and outside the party. Arguably the least powerful person in the senate until 2012. 

Which is of course not to say he has an all enthralling congressional career. He's gotten some things passed, a lot of amendments, his work in augmenting community health centers, his role in the 2014 VA bill where he worked with Jeff Miller and John McCain. But obviously not as much as anyone would like.
