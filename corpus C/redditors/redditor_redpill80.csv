I tend to trust MEMRI while acknowledging its a pro-Israeli source, whereas I don't trust the same Iranian government that calls Death to America, Death to Israel, and Death to England.

Using Juan Cole as a source is a tell-tale of your bias. Not only is he the ""Oliver North of Middle Eastern Studies,"" but prior to that 2005 article you source he had a major fued with [MEMRI](http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/1392) that calls into question his motives.

cvr18pw,0,t1_cvqrezy,redpill80,"> You do realize that 40 nations could make nukes 10 years ago, more so now presumably, right?

What's your point? We know Iran *can* do it, we don't want them to because it affects our national security. Once they have ballistic missile technology, we may have no realistic option for a strike.

> The reason they don't make nukes, is because nuke are actually overrated.

Japan didn't think so.

Let's break down each point in the article: 
1. There has been no actual verification of the existence of the fatwa itself, and such a fatwa appears in no publicly available lists of Iranian fatwas. The fatwa is nonexistent.2. Example of Long-term advantages: No outside force can pursue regime change, Iran can give bomb to proxy, etc.
3. LOL Iran is oil-rich, has limited need for nuclear energy so this makes no sense when taken at face value.
4. Iran thrives on a revolutionary reputation. Isolation from America and its allies would not matter. China and Russia unlikely to isolate Iran again
5.  Khamenei has no final say so what other politicians want is unimportant.
6. This argument alone makes clear the idiocy of the author.
7. maybe this is legit? I really don't know. But not sure why it matters.
8. haha Ahmadinejad. enough said
9. Plausible deniability with a proxy. Also, Cuban missle crisis proves otherwise
10. Iran watched closely the fate of Saddam and Gaddafi without nukes, and North Korea with nukes

> There's ZERO evidence of any nuclear weapons program in Iran, ever.

As icon0clast6 said below, >>You might finding the book Countdown to zero day interesting. I mean stuxnet infected and trashed thousands of centerfuges that were enriching uranium. All that uranium enrichment was just for funzies right?

cvqyl8h,0,t1_cvqs6is,redpill80,"I actually really like the Iranian people and think we are natural allies. But Khamenei has the final say, and he's made it clear that not only will Iran not be a market for American goods and services but that America is an [enemy](http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/8763.htm).

Also, Iran is now helping to fund the Taliban and they've targeted our soldiers in Iraq and Lebanon through proxies. If by secure post-invasion Iraq, you're referring to when they have fought back ISIS but have secured Shiite and not coalition interests, then we're talking about the same examples. 

As for the argument that the Iraq war supporters and Iran deal-opponents are one and of the same, there are those who were very much against the Iraq war who are very much against this [deal] (http://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-delivers-remarks-on-iran-nuclear-deal-at-seton-hall-universitys-school-of-diplomacy-and-international-relations). The lessons of the Iraq war teach us that we must be prudent in our approach to Iran, but we also cannot make the opposite mistake this time. Also, unless you live in Israel, mischaracterizing Israelis' clear, if at times excessive, apprehension over its survival as being ""butt-hurt"" is ridiculous.

cvqrmvm,0,t1_cvqrdqi,redpill80,"> Intervening in countries domestic affairs to get an ideal outcome for the interfering country.

Yes, you are correct. We agree. I care because Iranian and American interests are almost always mutually exclusive, and in the case of ISIS the trade off for Iranian hegemony is at best neutral.
