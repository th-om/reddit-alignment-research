cvvdvwc,0,t1_cvuqocg,dragnabbit,"I went to a night club on Walking Street in Pattaya.  Thai people were charged 50 baht for a beer, Farangs were charged 100.  I showed up there and met my girlfriend and her friends who were drinking 50 baht beers, and the next round of beers they got delivered to their table were 100 baht, simply because I sat down.

The double pricing wouldn't be so bad if it were Thai versus foreigner, but it is entirely based on skin color.  

I had a friend who was one of those rare farangs who became a Thai citizen.  He owned a dive shop in Pattaya, spoke fluent Thai.  He still would get charged the ""foreigner"" price.  On the other hand my stepbrother's wife is Thai.  They live in Gainesville, Florida.  Their kids were born in America and have American passports, but look pretty Thai.  When they went to one of the national parks up around Udon Thani, they weren't charged the ""foreigner"" price, even though they couldn't actually speak Thai.",4,0,1444528317,1444719533

If she had started purposefully targeting pedestrians or driving off at high speeds, different story.  But as things were, she wasn't meriting death from her actions.",4,0,1444454248,1444719533

I don't have any of the stuff you are talking about, so I suppose I can't offer you any advice, except to call Chase.  They seem to be pretty good about fixing problems.  I do like their customer service a lot.

So the system has become self-perpetuating:  60-year-olds use it to communicate with 40-year-olds, who use it to communicate with 20-year-olds, et cetera.  So in 20 years when today's 40-year-olds are 60 years old, and today's 20-year-olds are 40 years old, people born today *will be expected* to have Facebook so that Grandma and mamma can see what they are up to at school.  

I mean, okay, maybe in 40 or 60 years, Facebook could become less relevant, but when you have this many generations relying on Facebook for it's most basic function (""how was your day? / what are you doing?"") it will keep going.",3,0,1444286353,1444719533

Sigh.  Nowadays, 48% approval is as close to 100% approval as you can get, since nearly none of the 49% of Americans who voted for the Republican candidate would ever say the Democrat is doing a good job (and vice-versa).",-1,0,1444214551,1444719533
