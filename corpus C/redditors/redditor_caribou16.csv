cvx1yx3,1,t3_3ofil8,caribou16,"I don't know if the other AI's refusing to deal with you is a bug.  I had it happen to me, but after killing off Hughes (He refused to make peace with me due to the war score dictating he give me his only remaining city), all the other AIs became very stand offish, despite being 9/9 on the rep/fear scale.

If this is some sort of hidden warmonger penalty, they should at least let you know that's the reason!",4,0,1444667761,1444722059
cvx0xwg,0,t1_cvx0rck,caribou16,"See, I always thought the 10 commandments applied to Jew on Jew relationships and fuck everyone else, which would make genocide ok.  In the same vein, ""thou shalt not commit adultery"" makes more sense as ""keep it in the tribe"" rather than extra marital sex, since wasn't it pretty common to have multiple concubines in addition to a couple of official wives?",4,0,1444666149,1444722059
cvwzljt,0,t1_cvwz4ye,caribou16,"My point is there is no difference between a hologram with a physical manifestation (Voyager Doctor), simply residing somewhere in computer memory (TNG's holographic Moriarty or Lt. Commander Data).  

Presumably, if the Doctor was granted the legal status of a sentient being, it would apply regardless of how he physically chose to manifest himself, or not be physically present at all.

That being the case, on the grounds of the events of TNG's ""The Measure of a Man,"" I submit the Doctor would be considered legally sentient.

""Other"" less sophisticated holograms would be no more sentient than any other example of an autonomous robot.",3,0,1444663973,1444722059
cvwtgyb,1,t3_3oezio,caribou16,"It's not as much as you would think.  You figure 401ks are tied to a percentage of employee salary, so realistically are only a few hundred dollar investments for most.  And not everyone is paid twice a month, many are on an every two weeks schedule, which won't always match up with the 1st and 15th.",9,0,1444650216,1444722059

cvuz14n,1,t3_3o6m1z,caribou16,I did my internship at the IT service desk for a hospital.  We would get get calls from patients who wanted to know answers to medical questions.  We would get calls from employees over things like flat tires.  ,3,0,1444500583,1444722059

If they're standing around, they would probably rather talk to you about something they enjoy, but if you're wasting their time which could be spent helping a paying customer, that's not cool.",3,0,1444419093,1444722059
