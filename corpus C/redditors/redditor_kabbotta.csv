cvxdy5z,0,t1_cvxbgkm,kabbotta,">Regarding virtual connections - i would put them about equal to average rl connections.

It kind of seems like you just agreed with me. You're saying you roughly value them both equally. I would suggest that is far different from many people who think virtual relationships are some kind of cheap substitute for real relationships that are distracting throngs of people from *really* living their lives. My point is that I find that to be a dramatic over-exaggeration, and it kind of seems like you do too.",1,0,1444685077,1444726696
cvx7pd0,0,t1_cvwwpug,kabbotta,"The same thing, but worse, can be said for small talk. The amount of times that talking about the weather with a person actually leads to some kind of beneficial networking opportunity is incredibly small compared to the amount of times it doesn't. You can't just say the average person inspired by science doesn't do much more than be entertained by the event without also noticing that the average chitchat also doesn't lead to anything valuable.

Secondly, I think you're dramatically underestimating the net effect of inspiring people through exposure to how the world works. A huge list of astronauts and scientists all will tell you that some work of fiction is what first convinced them to pursue exploration. Star Trek alone has been credited a huge number of times. So even if we accept your number of 0.1%, then as long as that 0.1% includes only Einstein, Noether, and Gauss, then its effects on society are still almost beyond measure. Without modern physics, almost everything about our society would be different, and modern physics requires a large number of people who are inspired to know more about nature.

Again, I'm not saying that having personal friendships is useless. I'm just saying that having virtual connections and access to the world's information is much more valuable than many people seem to think, and in many cases, offers the better alternative.",1,0,1444676167,1444726696
