cvwnr0q,0,t1_cvwbjgh,Stormgeddon,"Yeah I'm liberal as they come, but I don't think we should cut the military too drastically. The military is one of our biggest public works programs providing stable, well paying jobs, good insurance, good benefits, and free education (plus training depending on duty).",1,0,1444628151,1444716607

cvquydg,0,t1_cvqsqr6,Stormgeddon,"Future reference, telling them to go away in French seemed to work pretty well, at least for me. One ""Va t'en"" and they left me alone.",2,0,1444184925,1444716607
cvqhkyn,0,t1_cvqf8am,Stormgeddon,Why not both? The Taliban for fighting by the hospital and the Air Force for using such powerful weapons so close.,1,0,1444162704,1444716607

cvogn2h,0,t1_cvnrpy6,Stormgeddon,"I mean, I realize this is totally why the Taliban fights around targets like this, but can we really say that destroying the only hospital for hundreds of miles and killing NGO workers is an acceptable side effect?

I realize that more US soldiers may have died without the air support, but in addition to the people who died in the hospital, countless more will now due to the lack of healthcare.",2,0,1444009074,1444716607
cvkmfj9,1,t3_3n3nib,Stormgeddon,"I would also be interested to know if these are being reported as pre or post tax. I know that in at least France, salaries are almost always spoken in post-tax terms, while in the US we always talk in pre-tax rates.",10,0,1443716240,1444716607
cvi8f4t,0,t1_cvhwm5u,Stormgeddon,"We also have some of the worst labor laws (vacation days, etc) and social programs (university education, healthcare) of any first world country, so I guess it depends on what you find important in a country.

Also, the EU as a whole has a higher GDP than the United States.",2,0,1443544893,1444716607
cvei0d7,0,t1_cvehtyr,Stormgeddon,What? There's a big difference between creating a life for the hell of it and ending a potential life. Your scenario doesn't follow my logic at all.,6,0,1443238712,1444716607
