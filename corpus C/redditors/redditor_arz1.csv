ctoj604,0,t1_cto74a8,arz1,"The *logical* conclusion is that just because a mummer possesses something, that does not falsify it. Is everything Varys does or involves himself in something other than it appears to be? All I'm saying is that the House of the Undying vision couldn't just come out and say ""VARYS IS BRINGING AEGON TO YOU!!!!!!!!"" It needed to be enigmatic and indirect so GRRM decided to use the phrase 'mummer's dragon' and theorists are over-interpretating it.",2,0,1438485478,1444728810

If your theory depends on another theory you're not as credible as you think you are. Varys could simply be acting for the realm and believes a Targ is the only one that can rule properly given the current circumstances and his claim is stronger than Dany's.",2,0,1438485090,1444728810
