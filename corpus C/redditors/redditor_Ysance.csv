We shouldn't punish lawfully carrying a concealed firearm for self defense, in fact I think we should encourage it.

There are already plenty of laws to punish a school shooter, such as brandishing and murder laws. This law punishes only good people who have a need to carry firearms for self defense.",-1,0,1444688066,1444723741
cvxfm3e,0,t1_cvxei62,Ysance,"You have to be 21 to carry a concealed firearm legally, and I'm pretty sure 21 year olds consume a lot of alcohol everywhere, not just on college campuses. People who don't go to college consume just as much alcohol as people who do.

And of those 33k gun related deaths, about two thirds are suicides, so I'm not sure how they are relevant to this discussion, and a substantial number of the rest are gang related or drug related.

And we have the data from the numerous states which already allow this, it hasn't been a problem, no resulting incidents of death associated with a concealed carry permit holder, accidental, intentional, or suicide, and no thefts of the gun of a concealed carry permit holder either.",18,0,1444687661,1444723741
cvwxwu8,0,t1_cvwx0cd,Ysance,"I agree, people should take a class, or be taught by a friend or family member.

The requirement though creates an undue burden on a right. If someone grew up shooting an inherits a gun they want to carry, they know how to use it. They might be poor and work 2 jobs and not have time and money to go do the mandatory training, but they would be perfectly safe to carry. We have thereby removed their rights through an undue burden.

Since only 505 died from gun accidents in 2013, around 1.5% of gun deaths, accidents aren't a big issue. Safety training isn't going to reduce murders and suicides. We've proven people are responsible enough that we don't need to require training. Training won't force people not to be idiots anyway, there is no evidence that accidents are less common is states with mandatory training.",1,0,1444661071,1444723741

cvwxkbv,0,t1_cvww7js,Ysance,"The underlying factor is that their society was never flooded with more guns than people.

They had strong weapon control since the days of swords in like 1500.  We were founded on gun freedom and have over 300 million unregistered guns, which we would fight to the death the prevent the government from taking from us.  We would literally overthrow our government if they tried to take our guns.  You can't stuff this cat back in the bag.

And remember two thirds of our gun deaths are suicides, but japan has a far higher suicide rate than our homicide and suicide rates combined.  More people per capita die in Japan from suicide than in the US from both suicide and homicide together.

There are over 30,000 traffic accident fatalities each year even with training requirements.

Most states have no gun training requirement at all, but there were 505 accidental gun deaths in 2013. That's down nearly 50% in the last 5 or so years. The deaths aren't 'countless', it is a really small number.

You can't claim that safety training will remove anything but a small percentage of the accidents. It isn't going to stop murders or suicides.
