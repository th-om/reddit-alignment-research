We don't see ourselves having the opportunity to be comfortable middle class any more when just about all of the income growth is going to the richest people. More and more of us are going to college, getting tons of debt, then ending up living paycheck to paycheck anyway.

>The second amendment was written to protect the natural right to self defense.  It was also written to ensure that the government would not get a monopoly of force by guaranteeing that the people would retain some capacity to use force.

This was also written when the cannon ball and muskets were the epitome of arms manufacturing. Now it would be bringing a gun to a drone fright. I think that political revolution is far more practical now than an armed revolution. 

I have zero problems with someone wanting to own a gun for self defense, but I honestly feel that the guys that are stock piling weapons for the day they can start using gorilla warfare against our government are far more dangerous to society. They also happen to be the most vocal 2nd amendment supporters. Is wanting a bloody civil war considered mental instability? Is it the intent of the gun manufacturers and lobby to have mass killings with guns so that more people buy guns and increase their profits? 

It's a massively complex issue, that needs serious debate by rational people, but one side seems to simply stick their fingers in their ears and yell ""2nd amendment"" repeatedly every time someone wants to have that conversation.",1,0,1444073645,1444731802

cvcewqd,1,t3_3m5ocm,jokerwanted,"When i first started paying attention to politics and looking into the issue, I was the exact same way. I wanted to vote republican because they were supposed to be the fiscal conservatives, and the social issues were not as important to me, but if someone was pro abortian banning or gay discrimination, then it disqualified them no matter how well I agreed with the rest of their stances.

The problem is that I soon found out that most national republicans simply are not fiscally conservative. They say they want to lower taxes and spending, but what they actually do is lower taxes for the rich, and increase spending on meaningless wars, then cut funding to education, SS, and medicare. After all that, we end up with higher deficits, stagnating wages, and the possibility of ending abortion and continued discrimination against gays.

The democrats on the other hand, are not a lot better. They tend to cut taxes as well, but do not tailor them to the rich. THey don't want to seem anti-military, so they increase spending, but are less likely to actually go to war, but not by much. The main thing is that they do not want to cut funding to things that are important to most Americans, but usually give in to the Republicans any way. So for national candidates, I no longer vote for either party, and vote Gary Johnson in the last election, and for the independent or libertarian for Congress.

For the current race, I am not openly supporting anyone, mostly because there are not too many third party candidates at the moment. If you held a gun to my head and told me to vote now, I would go Sanders or even Lessig(Getting money our of politics is my most important issue, so I could vote for him, but the rest of the stances would be reliant on his VP since he intends to step down after completing that task). An increase to minimum wage would help so many people to longer be in poverty, and since they spend all their money anyway, it would mean that all that money is going into the economy. I believe in equality, and the rhetoric on the right is just appalling. People talking about a religious test for office, building walls, lying about highly edited sting videos, and wanting to not have peace with Iran, and start ANOTHER war in middle east. The only ones that are decent are Kasich and Paul, and I cannot see them standing up too much to the hard right if bills hit their desk regarding abortion or gay rights. 

Local elections are much more open though, they are far less corrupt, and republicans can be far more moderate at that level, so I vote about half and half at that level. Nationally, however, I cannot vote for a republican.",1,0,1443091151,1444731802

cv8w1a7,1,t3_3lqu7l,jokerwanted,"One way to look at it is to think of whether the money was given after they were elected. Would you consider it free speech and protected by the constitution if The Koch brothers met with a politician in a back alley with a brief case full of money and said to vote no on some legislation they want pushed through?

The only difference is that this money is being spent in order to get them into office because the candidate with the most money wins the vast majority of the time. Now, I agree, saying that someone cannot donate to a politician is bad, so limiting it say 100, then they can express their speech, but everyone is equalized. The issue with PACs is different, but they definitely should not be tax exempt. I think the best method would be a constitutional amendment. ",1,0,1442833525,1444731802
