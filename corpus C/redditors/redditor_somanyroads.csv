There's no going back from that final step, and if you hold on, you might be surprised you ever thought oblivion was the best choice. Its actually the worst...exiting the world into black. It only sounds romantic on paper: in reality it devastates the lives of people you might not even know you can touch. ",3,0,1444708571,1444718762

cvxseav,0,t1_cvx2otp,somanyroads,"Two goals that sound good on paper, but falter somewhat in real scenarios. You don't want visiting admin to discuss enrollment to be like a trip to the DMV, where you wait in ridiculous lines. That's the consequence of cutting admin down. The second concern has trouble with defining who ""deserves"" higher education. No one can argue that having a diploma in a growing field can greatly increase one's earning potential: that's why people attend college! How do you decide who should not be allowed to pursue those opportunities? Am I doomed to living paycheck to paycheck because I don't have the right scores?",1,1,1444708060,1444718762

cvxs2ir,1,t3_3oggov,somanyroads,"If you dislike Hillary, than the choice is easy: regardless of how far left you perceive Bernie (when his positions are polled, one by one, the majority of Americans agree) it won't have a major difference in how Congress operates, which is where things like minimum wage get changed.

Obama wants the minimum set at 10.10 right NOW, and that is a struggle, in our current (dysfunctional) Congress. Bernie would be talking about 15 dollars in 2-3 years (election is still a year away), and that would be compromised downward anyhow. If you don't start from the left, than you'll inevitably be pulled to the right: this has happened with Obama time and again.",1,1,1444707495,1444718762

cvwuu72,1,t3_3of0xx,somanyroads,"Are you measuring what you eat, particularly nuts/seeds? Nuts are easy to go overboard on...keep net carb under 20g (most european labels already subtract fiber from carbs, so no math needed!).",2,0,1444654466,1444718762
cvwuro2,1,t3_3oei5y,somanyroads,"Yep, body dismorphia, it happened to me when I lost weight recently. I got down to 180 eight years ago (when I was 20) through exercise and a standard low-calorie diet. It oddly felt like more of an accomplishment then, but my body was also a better composition then: 180 now feels ""fatter"" than 180 then, and I do feel it's because I have less muscle overall. 

I think exercise is important in that regard: keto works without it, but weight lifting and good cardio bring a sense of accomplishment beyond just the fat loss. Knowing I can lose the weight without regular exercise, though, makes drumming up the motivation hard sometimes â˜º

You just have to take people at their word, and 90 pounds is HUGE, no matter what your brain tells you.",1,0,1444654281,1444718762
