If you're not in the mood for reading, the tl;dr they provide is:
>""No confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 4 October. **This is the first time that a complete epidemiological week has elapsed with zero confirmed cases since March 2014.** All contacts have now completed follow-up in Sierra Leone. However, over 500 contacts remain under follow-up in Guinea, and several high-risk contacts associated with active and recently active chains of transmission in Guinea and Sierra Leone have been lost to follow-up. There remains a near-term risk of further cases.""",3,0,1444255967,1444728520

cv502s2,0,t1_cv4x1gv,__TheLastDodo__,"""New guy"" is Muhammadu Buhari, the leader of the Nigerian military in the 1983 coup who ruled Nigeria until he was deposed in 1985. Like Boko Haram, he's muslim and from the Northern part of Nigeria, so there's no doubt Boko Haram supporters would have voted for him. It has gotten even to the point that there are conspiracies that Buhari himself is a sponsor of Boko Haram.

I think Buhari is trying to impress the world by ""conquering the terrorists"" while Boko Haram fades away due to their candidate in power, a win-win for both. On September 9th, the Nigerian Military claimed they had [""destroyed all known Boko Haram camps""] (http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/189748-boko-haram-camps-wiped-out-nigerian-military.html), but just look at the news today: [Boko Haram is still around] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/11869261/Nigerias-Buhari-suggests-Boko-Haram-amnesty-for-Chibok-girls.html).

TL;DR: New president is muslim, Boko Haram likes him, Boko Haram pretends to be defeated as the new president gets to look like a hero. ",-8,0,1442516867,1444728520
