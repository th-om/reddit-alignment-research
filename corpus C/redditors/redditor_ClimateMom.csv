cvx8fhw,1,t3_3oeuus,ClimateMom,"As others have said, I think Sturgeon's Law applies here, but once you've found a few good authors who write to your taste, it usually does become easier to find others, because you can browse through their bookmarks, the bookmarks of people who've bookmarked them, and find rec lists more easily that include the types of fic you want. So keep looking.

I'm fond of fics where the romance isn't the be-all-and-end-all myself, so I wish I could point you in the direction of a few good ones myself, but unfortunately, I don't read much femslash and can't remember having read any that qualifies as long or plotty. It's a relatively small percentage of fics in general, just because the majority of fic is written by straight women who are naturally going to be more interested in het or slash. A couple of slash examples off the top of my head that I think would meet your qualifications include:

cvx30oe,0,t1_cvwweei,ClimateMom,"It's in the ""crop yields under drought conditions"" subheading. Basically, what happened with the corn grown under the organic legume system that year was that the cover crop soaked up too much of the soil moisture, so the corn underperformed relative to both the organic manure and the conventional systems. 

Both organic systems outperformed the conventional one in soy production during the drought year, again most likely because of higher volumes of water percolating through the soil.

I don't remember if it stated this outright in the study, but both organic systems scored significantly better on measures of soil health such as carbon content and soil biomass, so I assume that's probably what caused the difference in water percolation and retention. In a year with normal rainfall, it wouldn't make a big difference and the conventional crops would outperform the organic ones, as indeed they did. But during drought years, higher soil organic matter content, more earthworms, etc. can make a big difference.

This is one of many reasons why I think the ability of conventional agricultural systems to ""feed the world"" is greatly overstated, especially in regions like the Sahel and the arid parts of India, where droughts are frequent and access to irrigation is poor. Especially with climate change coming down the pipeline, we need to move towards a combined system that includes the best of both organic and conventional worlds. Widespread use of cover cropping would be a good first step - as this study demonstrates, it's not a panacea, but it typically does reduce runoff by a significant degree while increasing soil fertility, biomass, and organic content. Reduced yields in the short term would be a small price to pay for increased resilience in the face of climate change and its associated increased risks of both drought and flood, the effects of which are also mitigated better by soils with high organic matter content and more consistent soil cover than those without.",1,0,1444669369,1444722567
cvwsjdm,0,t1_cvwd288,ClimateMom,"Cover crops normally have the effect of reducing nitrate leaching, so I think it's worth noting for the benefit of people who don't want to read the linked study that the year in which they increased it was a drought year in which the organic crops were stunted and unable to fully utilize the nitrogen from the legume cover crop. Interestingly, the organic manure based system outperformed both the organic legume cover crop system and the conventional system in yields that year.",1,0,1444646559,1444722567
cvws2mi,0,t1_cvwiaub,ClimateMom,"GMOs as currently implemented make monocultures and chemically intensive agricultural systems easier, and are thus perpetuating and encouraging  unsustainable agricultural practices. It's certainly not an issue unique to GMO crops, but they are some of the most egregious examples due to the way the promote the development of pest resistance. I.e. Bt crops do indeed reduce overall pesticide use (herbicide resistant crops actually increase herbicide use, though) but they're also rapidly destroying the effectiveness of a very mild and safe pesticide. Prior to the introduction of Bt crops, Bt sprays had been used since the 30s with only 1 pest species developing resistance. Now 7 pest species have developed resistance. ",0,0,1444644459,1444722567
