cvo30fq,0,t1_cvnkrwm,Aguy89,"While I agree that there were differences between each other and there are misleading parts of this map, I don't think it is necessarily unfair to discount the importance of the states being islamic. The fear of the expansion of Islam was something that concerned many Europeans during that time. The Crusades, the fall of Constantinople, the many rallys to war by the pope against Islamic expansion. Each state was different and wars were waged for various reasons, but a lot in Europe seemed to have feared the spread of this religion. A lot of this fear seems to still even manifest itself today.",1,0,1443986873,1444728532
cvn5iet,1,t3_3ndxo2,Aguy89,"I'm really sorry that happened to you, but I had a similar situation to that. Well I have United Healthcare and they refused to allow me to try humira before cimzia. They called and told my doctor that my plan covered cimzia first and then humira if cimzia failed to be effective. Sure enough cimzia was a waste of time meaning a few more months of subpar health. So then my doctor had to do an appeal I guess to the insurance company to change over to humira. I assume cimzia is either cheaper or the company has some negotiated price with cimzia. It sucks, but you might have to wait for a a few months and see how you do. Still try and talk to someone maybe they will be able to help you. Sorry though.",2,0,1443909099,1444728532
cvn3nvi,0,t1_cvmuu3r,Aguy89,I feel like I am one of the few people who didn't really like it. Maybe it was because I reread the book before watching and felt it was too different. I liked that Wes did something different with the movie though.,5,0,1443905701,1444728532
cvkjv03,0,t1_cvkj76z,Aguy89,"This begs the question to me, why it is only black characters that are needed for diversity. Hispanics are slated to be one of the largest ethnic groups and Asians are slated to be the dominant immigrants in the future yet when I hear complaints about a lack of diversity in movies it is always geared towards a lack of black characters not a lack of others. Also I would also add that when black characters are placed in movies they are more typically put in less stereotypical roles than other ethnicities. Just seems to be an often neglected subject when diversity in movies is raised.",1,0,1443712490,1444728532
cveivnu,0,t1_cvdvkkc,Aguy89,Man I haven't seen the most recent one and got all excited that the US was making a comeback.,0,0,1443240913,1444728532
cvcswoy,0,t1_cvcrzyy,Aguy89,"I think the support from most people stems from the fact he speaks his mind and criticizes the establishment while the other candidates are pretty cookie cutter, reliant on the establishment, and not really promising change. He is liked for similar reasons Ron paul and Bernie sanders are liked. I'll give him credit for things like that. I understand the support for his candidacy, but I don't agree with it or the support his policies garner. ",3,0,1443117346,1444728532
cvbeeji,1,t3_3m0xif,Aguy89,Worked great for me too! Congrats! when I had switched from Cimzia to that it helped. Glad to see your better!,2,0,1443020838,1444728532
cv8mxnz,0,t1_cv8i7mb,Aguy89,Yea I can only imagine. Seeing these cathedrals in the modern era is amazing in their own right. I can only imagine the reactions of people seeing them for the first time in the past.,1,0,1442803818,1444728532
cv8hzay,0,t1_cv8e62i,Aguy89,"Yea they did, but the cologn cathedral took the record later in the 1800s I believe. Europe seemed to have a race to build the tallest cathedral for a while. It is impressive that the Lincoln cathedral was the first to take the place of the pyramids and in England too!",2,0,1442795461,1444728532
