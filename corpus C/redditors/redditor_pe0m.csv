cvo7rfl,1,t3_3nfnci,pe0m,"One tends to keep the accent with which you normally speak. Therefore, if you start with an uninformed pronunciation of Chinese words (e.g., if you speak Wade-Giles instead of Mandarin) you are more likely to keep talking that way the longer you use these mispronunciations. 

It's much better to care enough about clear and easy communications to learn a standard pronunciation and then practice it every time you even think the sounds attached to romanizations or to Chinese characters.

In the beginning, somewhere around 1960, I got ou and uo confused. They just blurred in my mind. I still have to watch out or I will get something wrong because of spending two years in Chinese before realizing that I was regularly doing things the wrong way.

The photography is so good that I remember some scenes to this day. My absolute favorite is the one where the heat has been sweltering for weeks, the two kids go out to watch the steam engine and train go by, then it rains and they dance in the rain. 

I saw it in what was probably its first trip through American movie theaters. I don't recall the film being messed up at that point. ",2,0,1443413553,1444730869

The original movie goes back to the 1950s, had the first music by Ravi Shankar that most people in the USA had ever heard, etc. The original negatives have been through a lot, so the most recent restorations are important.",3,0,1443389952,1444730869
cv994om,1,t3_3kqqeh,pe0m,"Go to YouTube and get some of the lectures by General Paul van Riper. He points out that every complex dynamic system is an example of the three-body problem. So it is impossible to predict anything very far into the future. All you can do, ultimately, is to herd cats. You see a bulge somewhere and rush forces there to force those cats back in toward the center of the group. 

If you clear out all subjective influences you should get an unbiased but constantly changing picture of your reality. I don't think that is really an opinion. It's not a value judgment either. Your values, what you want the cats to do, is your own business, but it shouldn't sway your view of what really is happening. 

If you are forced to deal with a ""nasty"" person, you may see that s/he is currently doing this or that. Because you value staying alive, you may want to herd that individual this way or that way if you can. You need to have an unbiased perception of a murky situation. Then you need to watch for it to ""bulge,"" and you need to try to steer it. Your kid may decide that it is neat to scare old ladies by jumping down from on top of them using a bungee cord. He's not an evil monster and you shouldn't judge him as a ""born killer."" But he does need to be steered. You'll do better if you know where he's really coming from, and put aside both parental guilt and parental fear and parental affection while you are diagnosing the situation.

cv401hr,0,t1_cv3g509,pe0m,"I think I've fixed it. It took rigging a rope so I could actuate the clutch/brake from the other side of the tractor and watch what happens when the tensioner is moved out of action. It actually has a brake shoe built into it that comes into action as the tensioner is rotated out of operation. There was a problem with that idler pulley assembly, and so it took me a while to get it to where it would not let the v-belt jump off the motor pulley. I also had to put more oil in the transaxle. Evidently a lot had leaked out over the last several months. It hadn't occurred to me that the oil puts a needed drag on the transaxle pulley. I had already solved lots of the problem by polishing the track of the replacement transaxle pulley, but I still needed a little extra pressure on that pulley, an extra brake, to make it stop. It didn't take much pressure, but it wasn't stopping without it.

So, basically I did three things: 1) polished the transaxle pulley, 2) adjusted the clutch-tensioner (including getting the connection between the tensioner and the brake peddle axle set so that the tensioner would come all the way off the belt), filling the transaxle all the way up with heavy oil. 

The belt is o.k., but I've where to get one locally if I ever need it.

Thanks for your help. I'll probably put up a video of how the secret brake works. A couple of places have mentioned other ways of stopping the belt used by other transaxle designs, but nothing about this way of doing it.",1,0,1442440426,1444730869

She is saying, I believe, neige, neige, neige, literally, ""that, that, that...""

cv35vxi,0,t1_cv1zxle,pe0m,"Well, it looks like the previous owner may have mis-routed the drive belt. The problem is that the driven pulley has to be very slick so that it doesn't catch onto the belt unless the belt is tight. I polished the pulley thoroughly, but that hasn't been enough to fix the problem. 

The next step was to try to give the belt all the slack I could manage. That involved freeing up a lever arm mounted on a rotating rod. The connection between the rod and the arm had seized up over the decades. I finally got it broken loose and have started to get it readjusted. Just pulling on the v-belt, it looks like it will still turn the pulleiy on the transaxle even when it supposed to be in neutral, i.e. no tension on the v-belt. 

I don't know where to go from here.",1,0,1442375380,1444730869
cv1zxle,0,t1_cv1wvhe,pe0m,"If the belt were any shorter it would be impossible to get it onto the motor pulley. I think I see better, now, how the belt is supposed to be handled by the various non-moving parts. Their object should be to force the slack created in the belt when the brake goes on all down to the area around the driven pulley. Then there should be a plate on an extension of a line from the driving pulley to the driven pillow so that the belt cant belt to that side of the driven pulley and so must bulge away from the sides of the driven pulley as well as its back. I'll have to take another look at it in the morning.
