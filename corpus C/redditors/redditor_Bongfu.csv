cvvxpga,0,t1_cvvt1y5,Bongfu,"Well the HST you see in OP's video is not the HST that was writing Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas. That HST was younger and just getting the feel for this whole new style he was pioneering. As someone who has read the book (yes I will pull that card) I think Depp did better than anyone ever could because he knew the man personally. HST was like a modern day Shakespeare. He wrote in a way that, while English, it took the very enlightened to understand. He didn't dumb down his writing for common consumption, but instead explored how he could write even more poetically than he did. 

Depp understood him and deeply respected the man. I have serious doubts that an actor like him would betray his friend by not portraying him in the best way he could. ",1,0,1444582587,1444720328

cvrb4dy,0,t1_cvqomvf,Bongfu,Cougars are fucking everywhere. They have the largest range of any large cat and one of the largest for any land predator. They are super adaptable and stealthy.

cvqudy4,0,t1_cvqpcs0,Bongfu,"True, but the Taliban is not some redneck militia. They are an international organisation with a vast network of logistics, training, and recruitment. Maybe not as much as they used to be, but they are still way more powerful than any US militia would be at this point in time. ",1,0,1444183908,1444720328

No, if there ever was an uprising chances are we would never hear about it. The only sound the ""revolutionaries"" would hear before their deaths is the suppressed gunfire of some special ops team cutting their thread before it even gets started. ",3,0,1443883407,1444720328
