cvu1086,1,t3_3o3dq8,unlurkftw,"Time will tell.  The backbone of the new Microsoft is Azure cloud services and machine learning.  Thats where their new CEO, Satya Nadella, cut his teeth.  The idea that you need to have extremely powerful local hardware to run complex software is no longer always true and in many cases, the tide is shifting where you are offloading a lot of processing to remote servers.  I mean, just look at enterprise where so many companies have ditched their local servers, local apps, clunky teradata infrastructures, etc for cloud & hybrid cloud services - Salesforce, Heroku, Marketo, Google Compute Engine, etc.  Even enterprise software stalwarts like SAS (who sells software licenses for their desktop apps - which need very powerful computers - at like 10 grand a pop) are going to the cloud.

So the question is, how long will this gen last?  Because the Xbox One was built for a cloud strategy but the hardware was designed and released before the backend architecture was up and running.  Whats surprising to me is it still doesn't seem like the architecture is fully there.  When Crackdown 3 comes out and more devs start embracing cloud computing, you may find that the tide shifts in Microsoft's favor.  Or it may be that its still too early.

Make no mistake though - don't expect to have some beastly hardware next gen - the next console gen is going to be heavily reliant on cloud/remote processing and by that point, the architecture will be there to support it.  Any screen can become a thin client for gaming as distributed service.  Microsoft may have been wrong to bet big on the cloud *this generation* but in the long run, its a bet that guaranteed to pay off.",2,0,1444418276,1444729354

lol.  most people, asian or not, either want to go to a *great* school like the Ivys, or Ivy-esque schools like Stanford, NYU, Duke, Georgetown...

OR if they can't do that...

go to a great state school, like the UCs, or UMich, UVA, UT Austin, etc.  With a quad and sports and all that fun stuff.  Very few people in general want to study comparative marxist feminism and similar unmarketable nonsense at schools like Oberlin - where you lose both high quality academics and high quality party scenes & sports.",1,0,1444316987,1444729354
cvrrthl,0,t1_cvrrhn8,unlurkftw," I think you are looking at the world through a narrow race based lens.  Why should an african american kid with an HHI of 500k and access to the best tutors and schools be held to a lesser standard of achievement than a white kid growing up in a trailer in west virginia?  That seems to be the wrong outcome yet it is how the system works today.

The system should be income based since low income students have less access to educational resources.  Affirmative action, in its current form, is federally sanctioned institutionalized racism.
