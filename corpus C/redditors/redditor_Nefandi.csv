When I fly in an airplane all I feel is my arse in the chair while the clouds move outside the window.  It's not even slightly similar to flying in lucid dreams.  It's the difference between ""The machine is flying and I just happen to be sitting inside of it."" vs. ""I am flying.""  This is as close as I can explain with words.

Depends on licensing terms.  Really the USA style contract law is garbage because short of protecting you from allowing you to agree to be a slave, it doesn't protect you at all.

cvxv5uz,0,t1_cvwreoq,Nefandi,"> What is the rational basis for your belief that a $101m networth is hurtful to society? Where did you get your numbers?

I think the real number is below 100m, but I want to err on the side of the rich.

I took bottom median yearly income, which is currently 10k in the USA and multiplied it by 10 thousand years, to get 100 mil.  So someone at the bottom quintile would have to work and put it all into savings, without buying food or clothing, for 10 thousand years before reaching that level of savings.  This is how I visualize the distance in wealth between people.

I know we don't need people to be that far apart.  There is no rational reason for us to be so different from each other that some people have to save for 10 thousand years, longer than the recorded civilization, to arrive at some level of savings that's far far far been surpassed by some fatcats.",2,0,1444714192,1444728062

Not at all.

0% fat is bad.  Between 5% and 30% it's healthy.  Between 50% and 100% it's overweight, and beyond that it's grossly obese.

The extremes are bad.  People can't be 100% equal and trying to achieve that is another extreme.  But people also don't do well in highly unequal societies, and that's the extreme I was talking about.",1,0,1444713960,1444728062

cvxux4p,0,t1_cvx2lln,Nefandi,"> First off, use the word ""manipulation"" carefully. When I practice energy movement, it is an interaction between me and the environment or the object. Everything is sentient, and therefore chooses to respond or not respond to my energy signature.

Interesting choice of words.  You sound like an animist in your metaphysics.

>Anyways, if you do know the science between this practice, it is very explainable through scientific means. I'm still trying to figure out how, but it just seems reasonable.

Look up Mesmer.  He felt what he was doing was scientific and easily explainable, but the scientific community ended up rejecting him and his students.  Now almost no one even knows what ""animal magnetism"" means.

Personally I don't believe in any of this.  I'm not a phyisicalist, but I am not an animist and I don't believe in a universal fluidium the way Mesmer apparently had.  I'm a subjective idealist. :)  So it's easy for me to explain how transformations work, but it's still hard to do them in practice.

>On the hand of conceiving myself as a physical body, I wouldn't know how to respond to that.

I see.

>Also, from the standpoint I learned it as, everything has a magnetic field and it goes off in infinite directions, and those fields can be interacted with.

That's very similar to what Mesmer was postulating too, if not identical.

However, there is, I think a difference between Mesmerist ideas and animism.  I think Mesmer believed that the universal fluidium, which was an invisible and all-penetrating essence was programmable, but also insentient.  In other words, he believes insentient things were really just dumb things and you couldn't ask them anything the way you ask another human.  However, you could program them they way you might program a computer or smith a pot.  In other words, as I understand it, fluidium in Memser's conception could respond to intentions, but on its own it has no ambitions and no preferences.  This is different from animism where all things are thought to have a subjective dimension, implying that a forest might *prefer* to be wild, that it's a living being with preferences and perhaps even ambitions.  Like maybe the forest *wants to grow* as an ambition and not just as a mechanical thing that it appears to do.  To an animist even objects like stoves could possibly have preferences, and so would perform differently based on whether you worked with those preferences or ignored them.

Keep in mind, I'm not an animist myself.  I'm just curious.  That's all.",1,0,1444713530,1444728062

cvwq0ye,0,t1_cvvwr83,Nefandi,"Overweight vs obese.  Yea, there is a difference.  You can be too rich for your own good, but there is a point where personal wealth accumulations do become absurd and hurtful to society.  Only a greedbag would argue that point is far above 50-100 million net worth.  Long before the billionaire status, in other words.

No one is going to say something if someone has a few extra pounds.  But 800 lbs, no that's not a human being now.  That's closer to a cow.  Such people, like the 800 lbs person, can't move on their own.  They need entire teams to manage their economic footprint.

Right about the time when you need a team to manage ""your"" wealth is when you have too much of it.",1,0,1444635526,1444728062
cvwpnta,1,t3_3obucz,Nefandi,">Controlling for other relevant factors, such as the country’s level of income and education, we demonstrate that countries could grow their economies faster if there were less money controlled by the uber-rich. This implies that economies could be more efficient if more money were allocated to people other than those at the top of the income and wealth pyramid.

In other words, as the economy moves further away from a planned economy when the economic decisions become more distributed, the economy tends to do better???

Shocking!!  Really shocking news there.

What I think is weird is how people don't see that as the wealth continues to pool itself in fewer and fewer hands we're moving closer and closer to the planned command economy of the Soviet Union.  We're just allowing a handful of aristocrats to be our planners.  That's the only difference.

Party apparatchiks or oligarchs/billionaires?  How can one of these be right and one wrong?  They're either both right or both wrong together for the same reasons.

>Broadly speaking, billionaires come in two types – those who would not have made it without political connections (ie political cronies), and those who became billionaires because of their ingenuity, ability to innovate and willingness to take risks (ie the politically unconnected).
>
>These two types of billionaires may have very different effects on the economic performance of countries.

What a cartoonish distinction this draws.  It's like the good guys vs the bad guys.  All the billionaires are bad regardless of how they got there.  Wealth inequality beyond a certain level is inherently bad even if it's ""voluntary.""  Of course private property is a result of coercion to begin with, so that's why ""voluntary"" has to be in the quotation marks.

>Dividing the world’s billionaires into these two categories, one must *obviously take particular care* to assign the “politically connected” category of billionaires only to the most clear-cut cases, such as the Yeltsin-related oligarchs or Suharto-related nouveaux riches.

*Obviously*, eh?

What a revealing choice of words there.

>Those such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet surely also have extra political influence because of their wealth, but political connections aren’t the source of their wealth.

Source needed for this.  Basically the author is just assuming this.  He didn't verify it.  But then again, it's ""obvious"" and so it doesn't need to be verified.

Never mind that private property as an institution requires coercive political machinery to maintain it.
