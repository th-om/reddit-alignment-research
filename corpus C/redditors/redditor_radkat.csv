cveknvb,0,t1_cveiwm3,radkat,"It isn't really grammatically settled-- *Argentina* in Spanish is actually an adjective meaning silvery (conquistadors incorrectly believed there was a lot of silver to be found in the Rio de La Plata Region) and the full name of the country is *La Republica Argentina*, or ""the Silvery Republic"". It used to be common to refer to the country in English as ""the Argentine."" Thus, it would seem that ""Argentinian"" is a sort of a redundant double adjective of an adjective, but it's caught on, especially in the United States.

I've [seen it argued](http://therealargentina.com/argentinian-wine-blog/argentinian-or-argentinean-decisions-decisions/) that Argentine and Argentinean should be the demonym (someone from Argentina) and the adjective, respectively, but I've also seen it argued the [other way around](http://www.connect-123.com/blog/1892/argentinian-or-argentine/). I prefer Argentine but it's really not worth being pedantic over ... unless someone specifically asks I guess :)",9,0,1443246166,1444724900

cvbohrk,1,t3_3m3hpa,radkat,This is a bit off topic but is Kasich really a religious extremist? I don't know that much about him but based on what he said during the first debate ('that he would love gay family members unconditionally') he really didn't seem like a guy in the same boat as Huckabee or Jindal. ,27,0,1443035419,1444724900

To be fair isn't this 'moderate' (and I agree completely reasonable) stance actually to the left of what is currently policy in the US? And, this is after 7 years of Obama. Honestly even if a far-left candidate like Sanders gets elected I doubt your 'moderate' expectations could be achieved given the current political climate in Congress.",1,0,1443035228,1444724900
