The park service policy is basically the same as much of the High Sierra- after you start into snow season they don't want you parking overnight because of the possibility/probability of your car being buried by an overnight storm and best case causing issues for the plowing and worst case not being unburied until the spring.

There are designated ""Sno-Parks"" scattered throughout the High Sierra where you can leave your car.  Parking overnight at high elevation after mid-October outside of the SnoParks is more or less almost universally forbidden.

Tioga Road will close for the season after the first major snowfall.  This is usually in Late October or Early November:

cvvvmzw,0,t1_cvvrd0v,jakdak,"The seasonal waterfalls will be dry and the high country may have had its first snow, but October is substantially less crowded than the summer months.

Spring is probably the best time to visit both parks (wildflower season in Death Valley, waterfall season in Yosemite) but unfortunately the pass won't be open forcing you to drive around.

How are you planning on getting to the area (i.e. what airport are you flying into or where are you driving from?)

I'd usually lump Death Valley into a Vegas based visit (Zion, Red Rock, DV, Grand Canyon, Sedona, Valley of Fire, Hoover Dam, etc)

And Yosemite is better combined with Devils Postpile, Tahoe or the Coastal CA stuff (Big Sur, Big Basin, Muir Woods, etc) out of San Francisco/San Jose",3,0,1444578813,1444731438
