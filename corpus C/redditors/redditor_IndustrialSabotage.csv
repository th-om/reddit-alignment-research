cvwy4x6,0,t1_cvwxw6d,IndustrialSabotage,"I get where you're coming from, and understand the logic there, but the reasoning for tradesmen, when I talk to them, is that trades are backbreaking work, and often they end up destroying their bodies to make a decent living.  I hear them telling their kids to get a job that lets them not have to work outdoors, in the rain/snow/sleet/wind/cold/sun/heat every day for the rest of their working lives.",4,0,1444661471,1444730677

cvwt88d,0,t1_cvwnh7c,IndustrialSabotage,"Just wondering, but do you currently work in a trade?  I ask because among the tradesmen that I interact with, almost all of them would not recommend it to their kids, and would tell them to work for a degree in something else.",4,0,1444649352,1444730677

cvvjcmr,1,t3_3oa4p7,IndustrialSabotage,"I'm gonna be honest here, it looks like it does absolutely nothing.  Probably someone practicing joints, lathe work, gears, etc.  Maybe a platform for displaying something, but it's definitely not a stool.

The gears appear to have no viable function, unless you turn the octagonal piece in the middle to adjust the height? Have you tried it?  The nails stick out the sides of the legs, as well as those thin wooden slats on the top/seat, and those would catch on your pants or skin and make you unhappy.  The tiny gears on the bottom have teeth that would snap off if you moved your foot the wrong way.  Maybe it's an end table, or something like that, but end tables aren't generally adjustable in height.

My money is on someone practicing their woodworking.

EDIT:

from /u/usernametiger :

>I really want to believe its a cheese press but it looks like the top of the center post ends in an octagon shape with a space.
Maybe the nails on the side that are sticking out hold twine across the top to keep it held down.
This would make sense and also make it very likely to be a cheese press

This makes sense.  You turn the octagonal shape (which is only connected to the square rod below, it appears) and it raises/lowers the bottom ring of the ""seat"" above the lower frame using the threaded rods.  The nails definitely look like something that would hold a strap to keep the top level as it squeezes something.",41,0,1444538974,1444730677
