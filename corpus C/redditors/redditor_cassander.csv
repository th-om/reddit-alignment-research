funny, then, how that region continued to vote democratic for decades.  

>We have empirical evidence showing that 1964 did in fact see fundamental shifts in party allegiance.

No, [you don't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1964) 

>""Southern strategy"" is not just a general term for the strategy used by political campaigns to attract voters in the South; it is a particular phrase used to describe a particular strategy during a particular time period.

It's a term of abuse for a strategy that never really existed, a way to slander republicans that does not stand up to serious analysis.  

>Literally nobody has said anything close to this.

That's precisely what you've done, insist that republican started race baiting in 1964 to win the south.  Well, they didn't do that, and they didn't win the south.

>To summarize the point: 1964 saw a fundamental shift in the way white Southerners voted

flatly untrue.  

>The ""Solid South"" was largely a Democratic bastion until this realignment, after which time it turned solidly Republican. 

the south was not solidly republican until the 1990s no matter how you measure.  stop peddling lies. ",0,0,1444690018,1444716624
cvxgy5s,0,t1_cvx17ha,cassander,"> First off, that is interesting about the house elections in the 1990s, but I think we're talking past each other- I'm curious about presidential politics and the southern strategy as first described as part of a strategy used by Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. House elections are important, but because of Gerrymandering and lower voter turnout, they're a bit less reflective of which way a region leans.

Nixon didn't have a southern strategy, he had a whole country strategy.  in two elections he won 81 states, meaning 1/3 of the states he lost were in the south.  


> I should've been more clear in my original post- I meant ""against their economic interests"" like in the best-seller ""What's the matter with Kansas?

A monumentally foolish book that reeks of arrogance.  

>Why would poor people vote to cut their own unemployment benefits or SNAP benefits or anything like that? 

they don't.  whites without a college degree, by and large, make too much money to qualify for benefits like SNAP.  As I said, if you're a white man without a college degree, the democrats offer you nothing.  You make too much money to qualify for the welfare state, you are very likely to work in the sort of dirty industries that they are keen to regulate out of existence, you don't go to college so the massive subsidies to higher education don't help you, and if you do go to college they support actively discriminating against you in favor of less qualified people because of your race and background.  And on top of all of that, they constantly insult you and your culture, blame you for all the problems in the world, and want to raise your taxes.  

?> Let's say the Southern strategy is a myth. This textbook I'm currently reading doesn't even mention it, so I'm not trying to be combative here, I'm genuinely open to the idea. But the book does talk on page 1374 about Nixon's reelection in 1972 and says that ""The main threat to his [Nixon's] reelection came from Alabama's Democratic governor George Wallace, who had the potential as a third-party candidate to deprive the Republicans of conservative votes and thereby throw the election to the Democrats or to the Democratic-controlled Congress."" But we'll never know how that would've ended because Wallace was shot, and forced to withdraw from the campaign.

That's simply mathematically false.  Unless wallace unless wallace won every southern state, nixon would have won the election.  

>And they continue to get pulled to the right because of closed primaries, low voter turnout, the fact that social conservatives are more active voters, etc.

The republican party is not moving to the right, it's galloping to the left.  

> Let's also take a look at an infamous 1988 interview of Nixon's campaign strategist, Lee Atwater. (There's an article about it here as well.) Atwater said (I'm going to censor what he said because I'm not sure what the mods would think...):

Lee atwater does not speak for all republicans everywhere.  

>Same-sex marriage first hit the American consciousness in 1993 when its legality was questioned in Hawaii. Clinton was a popular president and we had a strong economy in the 1990s. Come the 2000 election, however, the GOP didn't really have to rile up the base on moral issues. 

I believe what you meant to say was ""an extremist administration tried to implement an extremely unpopular policy in allowing gays to serve in the military, which put the new left wing issue of gay rights onto the national state for the first time, only to be rebuffed by his own party for going to far.""  I am as pro gay rights as anyone, but those are the facts.  Republicans did not move right on gay marriage, democrats have spent the last 20 years galloping left.  

>Despite the hypocrisy of Newt Gingrich cheating on his wife while leading the charge to impeach Clinton, the GOP base saw the Democrats as the less moral party courtesy of Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. OK, whatever. Bush wins the 2000 election.

Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury, not cheating on his wife.
 
> Fast forward to 2004. We went after Al-Qaeda after the September 11th attacks, which was logical. We also.... went charging off into Iraq with no real evidence that there were any weapons of mass destruction there.

except, you know, for the many times Saddam actually used WMD on his people, his continual games with the inspectors, and the nearly unanimous opinion of dozens of intelligence agencies both in the US and abroad.

>you poke around and put same-sex marriage bans on the ballot in 11 states, including the quintessential swing state Ohio, to get evangelicals to come out and vote. 

Rove did not put those on the ballot, the people who lived there did, just like they did in 2002 and 2006.  

> We could get arrested for having sex in 14 states.

only in the sense that you can be arrested for packing hops in [a 37inch box in iowa](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/weird-state-laws).  

>It backfired because the media tore her to shreds, but I can see why the GOP did it

No, you can't.  you're letting your bigotry trick you into creating elaborate conspiracy theories with no basis in reality.

>My bet is that this round of primaries and previous history will drag the GOP presidential candidates to the right on social issues because of the base. And my bet is that it's a circus to distract from economic issues.

Once again, you label ""failure to move left"" as ""moving right"".  You need to stop doing that.  The GOP position on gays is unquestionably to the left of where it was 5, 10, or 20 years ago, it just hasn't moved as far left as the democratic position has. ",0,0,1444689775,1444716624
