>The problem is not so much that there is a Nobel prize in economics, but that there are no equivalent prizes in psychology, sociology, anthropology. Economics, this seems to say, is not a social science but an exact one, like physics or chemistry – a distinction that not only encourages hubris among economists but also changes the way we think about the economy.

It's not at all self-evident what distinguishes economics from other social sciences apart from a higher degree of quantification and modeling--things that make economics _look like_ science but which could also be said about such highly unscientific pursuits as attitude polling and marketing research.  

In particular, the social sciences generally don't have the neat hierarchy of math to physics to chemistry to biology. Biology overlaps with both anthropology and psychology, but neither are particularly foundational to economics. Also, most of the social sciences are heavily informed by the study of history, which is inherently very different from experimental science. ",12,0,1444701034,1444716502
cvximkn,0,t1_cvxhw6x,redwhiskeredbubul,">I guess the issue is that the conflict you speak of doesn't get the press the establishment/base one for Republicans do.

It doesn't, I think because the Democrats are better at keeping the lid on it (though that might be changing, cf Sanders) and also because most ideologically motivated progressives are impressively bad at being pragmatic when it comes to promoting their agendas within the party. 

>I mean, Clinton, Obama, Reid, and Pelosi are not into moderating positions.

Are we talking about within the party or within politics in general? Pelosi, no, is not a moderate either way (such is the House), but Clinton, Obama, and Reid are moderates within the context of the party, and they are really good at riding herd. In contrast to the Sanders crowd, for example, there is a big section of left progressives in the House who are decidedly _not_ ideological and who take those positions because they're supported by a highly specific constituency, often one that's primarily urban and black or latino. Those people all support Clinton. They generally actually get little play in the media. They're generally highly interested in supporting a few specific programs and calculatedly lukewarm/flexible on issues like foreign policy or same-sex marriage. It's total machine politics and it actually dates back to the Bobby Kennedy/Eugene McCarthy split. ",2,0,1444692498,1444716502
cvxhqla,0,t1_cvxfndu,redwhiskeredbubul,"> but their base tends to be more moderate than the people they elect

I disagree with this in part--I think that the core of the Democratic party leadership is really heavily invested in moderating positions, making accomodations,and controlling the far flank of the party. I also think this is pretty basic to the functions of any political party.  In that respect they're basically similar to the Republicans, though party discipline in the Democratic party is stronger. For the most part the DNC really heavily plays moderate majorities off against highly motivated minorities. Look at how calculating it's been about same-sex marriage.  

I'm also not so sure that ideology is a final explanation of how the Democratic party behaves.  Progressivism--whatever you think about its validity--is just as much of an ideology strictly speaking as tea party libertarianism is. The difference is that the dominant idiom of progressives in the United States has been, well, kind of elitist (rather than populist) for a long time--in this sense Warren and Sanders are sort of new. Historically progressives in the US came out of the Adlai Stevenson/Eugene McCarthy mold, and the political effectiveness of that, while never real impressive, was obliterated by Reagan. The DNC really wants to police that out of the mainstream of the party. There's also the role of policy, which in some cases is moderating. For example, in foreign policy the average view of a lot of progressives borders on isolationism, and the foreign policy establishment absolutely does not support that, which is part of why it doesn't show up much in the Dem platforms that actually win elections.

cvxgw71,0,t1_cvxds8o,redwhiskeredbubul,"> I wouldn't dispute that, since academia and media are dominated by liberals. Articles that contradict that worldview are actively opposed, conservatives seeking grants, publication, or even jobs are actively discriminated against. In any case, we were talking about reproducibility, not publication bias.

It's true that social scientists tend to be left-liberals but I think structural discrimination against conservatives is much less likely as an explanation than the fact that certain disciplines lend themselves to certain political worldviews. As far as the notion that political bias is the _primary_ source of bias in research, I think you're getting into crackpot territory there, insofar as there are much more mundane and plausible explanations for bias. For example, what about simple careerism? Publishing negative findings of whatever description is not great for your career. 

>If over half of psychology studies from a selective sample of pretty significant ones failed to reproduce the same data, what does that tell me about the rest of the studies on which policy is based?

Not much, actually? The _whole point of studying bias_ is that you shouldn't, and likely will, make precipitous conclusions on the basis of suggestive data. That's like literally what publication bias _is._ ",4,0,1444689689,1444716502

Publication bias is rampant in the hard sciences also, for one thing. A lot of high-profile _Nature_ or _Science_ articles turn out to be wrong.

Even starting from a somewhat uncharitable representation of Sanders's economic ideas--that _no_ orthodox economists support them--this is still a bad analogy. Sanders's ideas about economics are normative: he thinks inequality is the worst thing, basically. Carson's ideas about science are just factually wrong.  ",4,0,1444683678,1444716502
cvxcok3,1,t3_3ohbjk,redwhiskeredbubul,"If we're talking about the kind of individualism that _actually_ existed in the 18th century, it's been dead as a political force for at least a a hundred years, attempts at a revival not withstanding. The failure of that system of thought to prevent a civil war over slavery, or to anticipate the social effects of modern industrial capitalism, or the effects of progress in technology, all pretty much guarantee that. For example, Madison's arguments against direct democracy are tied to claims about transportation and communication that are totally obsolete on their face today.  

_However_, there is still a very strong case to be made that the values of early American republicanism are still very important. It's just that we can't premise our views on them on nostalgia, or assumptions about original intent.

cvuqlyq,1,t3_3o6q71,redwhiskeredbubul,"I don't know if this is the kind of critique you're looking for, but there were and still are huge amounts of polemical critiques of it from within Marxism, especially by Left Communists or Libertarian Socialists. Usually the upshot has been that third-worldism is politically superficial, arbitrary, and inconsistent with the rest of Marx's thought. It's also tended to be somewhat synonymous with Maoism in that context, so any criticism of Mao would be useful in that connection. [Here's](http://insurgentnotes.com/2012/10/notes-towards-a-critique-of-maoism/) a pretty thorough one. You might also find [this](https://www.marxists.org/archive/mattick-paul/1971/indochina-war.htm) useful. The crux of the second article is pretty much this paragraph: 
 
>Capital is not interested in the continued existence of industrially-underdeveloped nations per se. It is interested only to the extent that this state of affairs proves to be the most profitable. If a further development of backward countries should be more, ‘or equally, profitable than investments in advanced nations, capitalists will not hesitate to foster their capitalist development just as they hastened it in their own countries. Whether or not this could ever become a reality under the conditions of private-capital production is a question the capitalists cannot raise for their own continued existence is clearly bound up with the capitalization of the underdeveloped nations. They thus cannot help seeing in the formation and expansion of state-controlled systems a limitation of their own possibilities of expansion and a threat to their control of the world market. For them “communism” means the formation of super-monopolies which cannot be dealt with by way of monopolistic competition and have to be combatted by political-ideological means and, where opportune, by military measures.

i.e. third-worldism is bunk because the relationship between the nation-state and market expansion is already internal to capital and because state socialism is just a means of competing capitalistically with the United States. 

Again, I don't know how much you are looking for a Marxist view, but a lot of this critique has to do with the problem of real and formal subsumption: that is, the idea of jump-starting the revolution from the peasantry is supposed to be very wrong and bad because it ignores the basic point that the basis for communism is supposed to develop internally from capitalism. Whereas in Maoism the revolution is predicated on a class that is only superficially integrated into capital to begin with. Thus, by basing a revolution on it you end up creating a bourgeois revolution that actually establishes _capitalism_ in a semi-feudal society. Which is not a bad reading, by the way, of what wound up happening in the PRC. It's also consistent with some criticisms that have come out of postcolonial theory. ",4,0,1444482931,1444716502
