There are certainly going to be issues with figuring out how self-reporting bias in the surveys varies based on college enrollment, but it would at least be an improvement upon claims based entirely on narratives.",2,0,1443286079,1444727238

Absent of monopolistic behavior, what criteria would be used to determine which outlets should be separate? A limit on the number and/or scope of outlets owned by one company? Again we run into the downside of independent media outlets, which is that they must be independently profitable in order to sustain their existence.

cv63jhu,0,t1_cv636it,CouncilmanDexhart,"I don't think it's healthy either, but from my understanding of antitrust law, there would have to be evidence of collusion or exercising monopolistic authority in order to break up those conglomerates and/or prevent future acquisitions. Do you support future legislation that separates media outlets from other corporations in order to prevent consolidation? It's worth remembering that in the current business climate, many independent outlets struggle to persist on their own. Consolidation does help with marketing and allows quality journalism to be subsidized by more profitable crap.",1,0,1442599080,1444727238
cv630d5,0,t1_cv62ktx,CouncilmanDexhart,"That doesn't mean we shouldn't address possible unintended consequences ""because they're not happening now"".

Your specific objection was to the unlimited scope of Super PACs' ability to push their views. If that is the issue, you must also address how to stop media conglomerates from exercising that same unlimited scope. I don't see any way to do that without placing some limit on media spending. If you have an idea, please feel free to share it. I think reforming the system to improve democracy is one of the most important issues of our time. I just also think that solutions to this problem should be fully thought out so we don't end up with censorship or the utter demolition of all journalistic independence.",3,0,1442598273,1444727238
cv62iw3,0,t1_cv62cq3,CouncilmanDexhart,"The logic is that if you remove a method the rich can use to pus their political stances, they will find another way to do so that is within the law. That means that if you remove Super PACs, you must also place restrictions on other outlets the rich can use to accomplish those goals. Media is just the best example. Otherwise, you're just shifting where that money will go. ",5,0,1442597537,1444727238

Great acting, enjoyable historical references (political and technological), fantastic hand-to-hand combat. Some find the pacing to have become a bit slow, that'll depend on your preferences. The only drama I've liked more than it this year is Narcos.",1,0,1442257588,1444727238
