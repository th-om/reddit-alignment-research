We don't need to make the process any easier or less expensive.  We just need to cap profit.

First and foremost, it's you and I who are paying for R&D.  Pharmaceutical companies don't actually do this.  They blow their budgets on buying off doctors with expensive trips to Hawaii to push their drugs.  Sorry, they allow doctors to ""consult"" on business trips to Hawaii. <rolls eyes>

I understand drugs cost money to make but since we're subsidizing most of their R&D costs then we should put a cap on how much they can profit on those drugs.  Say total cost + 10% or whatever.  I'm not trying to put a specific # right here.

You seem to be nitpicking what I've written - and nitpicking it incorrectly - to draw conclusions that I'm clearly not making.

Basic Income makes perfect sense and would do a lot of good for everyone in the country, even those who make a lot of money.  Unfortunately, it would do a lot of good for blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, etc. so the GOP would have to oppose it.",2,0,1444234528,1444722427
