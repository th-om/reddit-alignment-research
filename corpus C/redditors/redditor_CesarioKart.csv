Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Kota Ibushi - Wrestle Kingdom 9

Kazuchika Okada vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi - Wrestle Kingdom 9

Kazuchika Okada vs. AJ Styles - Dominion

Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi - G1 Climax finals

cvvbem5,0,t1_cvv9aol,CesarioKart,"You could meet in the middle, and have interviews with Jarrett/whoever after the matches where they discuss what went into it. It'd be a reality TV discussion, like ""Wrestler X has all the tools to be a big name, but I wasn't ready to pull the trigger just yet,"" cut in with footage of them reacting to the decision. Imagine it's The Apprentice, but with winning the title as the prize.",2,0,1444523619,1444723588

I got the 60,000 from someone a few years ago (I want to say Cody Rhodes maybe?) talking about how much travel costs, and how a lot of the guys lower on the roster only make about that when it's all said and done. There's other financial incentives to be on the bigger show, like if you get a cut of your merch sales or are looking for endorsements, but the net income from wages for the guys relegated to Superstars and such isn't all that fantastic.",-1,0,1444419758,1444723588
