If that comes to pass as is being worked on. The value of old houses becomes zero (not scarce) and you won't refurb (like no one refurbish their vacuum), you'll just throw it out and buy a new and updated one. ",4,0,1444593711,1444728656

Being GOP speaker is currently a suicide mission, Boehner got wrecked and he was quite well suited for the job.  But no one wants that position b/c you lose by doing your job of being a politician and compromising in order to govern.  The GOP currently have no desire to do anything remotely close to governing or compromise.",17,0,1444333160,1444728656

cvkj2cp,0,t1_cvjkb3c,senjutsuka,"Well if you're making revenue, pay a developer for the needed work.  You dont need a partner or to share equity unless you have no revenue.  If you do have regular revenue then use that as part of the discussion.  Either as proof you're pushing forward and growing, or as leverage in the discussion of the value of the equity.  I'd start by offering a solid freelancer a contract for the needs.  When you find a good fit, offer equity/partnership to take the whole thing to the next level.

If you can really ramp up sales before the dev, do that.  You may be able to get funding in place based on the beta and then you'll have a financial partner rather then a dev partner and cash in the bank to pay labor.  Details matter for this particular route though.

cvjhj51,0,t1_cvjgb9r,senjutsuka,"Everything you write for the MVP is trash and will be discarded within a year if you are successful.  Expect it.  Write code like itll need to be read (good variable naming, proper oop, abstraction and modularization) as much as possible, but if you have to do an ugly ass hack, just do it.  Write a little comment in the code explaining this is trash and needs to be re-written by a systems architect or whatever but get it done.

Your biggest limit is not technology or coders, its clients.  If you sell this thing right now before you can show it fully functioning (and you had better be doing that if its this close to done) then you can sign a paying beta.  If you have a paying customer, you'll get a developer whose willing to take an equity stake a lot easier.  Sell first. Stay flexible.  React to those willing to pay you.  Everything else will follow.
