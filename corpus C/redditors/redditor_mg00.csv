I'm not sure what Bernie's timeline is, but even if he gets elected I don't see much going through a Republican controlled Congress.    If you went from ~$7 to ~$15 overnight I believe there would be some very significant economic impact across the country.",1,0,1443734598,1444724004
cvkz4hr,0,t1_cvkygjs,mg00,"Spot on. People forget that a decision like changing the minimum wage has far more impact than simply moving a supply and demand curve. Salaries are only one (albeit large) line on a company's P&L.    Further, a lot of people ignore the now increased buying power of minimum wage laborers that are likely spending all of their wages simply to get by. Look up Marginal Propensity to Consume if you want to read more into that.",3,0,1443734391,1444724004

ctt0c5i,1,t3_3fxahw,mg00,"If I'm drafting Gronk in the first, it's at the tail end of the round (10-12), and I usually end up grabbing someone like Jeremy Hill or Demarco Murray in the 2nd. It's also very possible to grab a WR like AJ Green and then hope you can grab two mediocre but serviceable RBs when you come back around for your 3rd and 4th picks but I prefer to have at least one RB by round two. I think going Gronk/QB is a terrible option even with 6 point passing TDs.",1,0,1438820807,1444724004

cte48bw,0,t1_cte1mjm,mg00,"You're right. Only the luckiest of the lucky could possibly finish college, either by picking a cheaper state school or getting ""lucky"" enough to get a scholarship (hint, studying hard helps) or ""lucky"" enough to get a grant (qualifying, researching, filling out applications, etc). Nobody can do this just by working hard, it's a total gamble!!

ctdjdt9,0,t1_ctdiy70,mg00,"Yeah he sure ""just got lucky"" by busting his ass for 4 years in college to get a ME degree and a good job. The lucky part is the speed in which he could pay off his student loans with housing profit... but with smart budgeting and a good job you can knock out 30k of student loan debt fairly quickly - go check out the personal finance subreddit.    

Buying a house and saving money to renovate it, then selling it with some profit isn't getting lucky, it's having a risk pay off. ",5,0,1437671056,1444724004
ctdidea,0,t1_ctddvze,mg00,"No, he didn't. He worked hard, got a good degree, and took loans to do it. His house rising in value was a risk that paid off, but either way he would have paid those loans off with a good job and hard work. I feel like the majority of people here just want to complain.
