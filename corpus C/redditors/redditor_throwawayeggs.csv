Also, your averages are pulled from no where, why would the average worker only process 100 cases, 100 applications, a year, That is one application every 2.5 days.  
In this scenario,  I can see costs of maybe a total of 50,000$ to pay for a nurse to conduct the drug screening. They would not even hire a nurse but just have those people go to an existing doctors office to take the test.

cvromb1,1,t3_3nvnw6,throwawayeggs,"There isn't talk to remove the amendment. There has not been a case that has looked at whether a person here illegally and has a child if that child is a citizen.
