cvxozxm,1,t3_3oj335,DeSoulis,">But now in modern times all the time i read of radical islamists killing for islam. I just dont see that many christians, jews, hindus etc doing the same kind of crimes.

That's because 1) Much of the Islamic world is not political stable, and the worst atrocities usually committed in regions lacking political stability. ISIS, for instance, exists because the Iraqi government is weak and sectarian, and because the Assad government in Syria lost control of most of the country. In environments without political stability the most violent, psychopathic elements of the population emerges at the forefront because there is no state which can contain them. It also unleashes sectarian and ethnic conflict which tend to be the bloodiest conflicts within and without the Islamic world.

This isn't too different from, just to give one example, Latin America during the Cold War: right-wing paramilitary groups raped nuns, slaughtered whole villages in the name of fighting Communism. Or Rwanda in the 90s, when 500,000 people were killed within a few month by machetes due to inter-ethnic conflict.

It's also because of 2) The western media, and let's face it, r/worldnews, in particular has a tendency of focusing on crimes committed by Muslims. No one for instance, pays much attention to crimes committed by the Chinese or Burmese government against their Muslim minorities. There's also a strong tendency to focus on the worst parts of the Muslim world (i.e Nigeria, ISIS) instead of the average parts because talking about politics in Indonesia doesn't garner as much attention even though it's by far the largest Islamic country. People pays an awful lot of attention to Islamic terrorism because it's a lot more relevant to politics in the English speaking world.

>Am i totally wrong for not being to fond of welcoming islam in europe or am i a monster because of it?

You can be anti-immigration without believing Islam is the worst religion of all time. There are issues within the body politics of the Islamic world in the Middle-East, the abominable treatment of women in large parts of it prominent among them. But at the same time, there are Muslim feminists and secular Muslims, such as in Turkey, Iran, and among the Kurds who gets far less attention. 

Ultimately the Islamic Middle-East today is in a state where it is undergoing something very much like the thirty years war in Europe , where 30% of Germany's population was killed. An observer of Christianity back then might well have declared it more hopeless and evil than Islam of today.",1,1,1444702516,1444720721
cvwr0j6,0,t1_cvwnzjv,DeSoulis,"> In 1953 Lavrenty Beria was the clear favorite as Stalin's successor

This wasn't very clear at all, there was never a clear anointed successor to Stalin, and Stalin had in fact maneuvered Beria out of some of his power in the security services prior to his death. Furthermore, he was hated by just about everyone else in the upper echelons of his party for his role in heading the NKVD , as well as his personal habit of raping and murdering women. Party connections and gaining acceptance among Stalin's inner circle was vital if one was to run the country and Beria never had it. It appeared that the Soviet Union might be heading towards some sort of collective leadership in the wake of Stalin's death.

While it was most likely that Stalin's inner circle had agreed upon reforms to be made after his Stalin's death, Beria moved with very rapid speed on reforms. Some of them seemed quite radical and Beria suggested giving the Republics genuine autonomy as well as come to some sort of understanding with the west. He supposedly called NKVD branches across the country and ordered ethnic Russians to be removed and replaced with locals, even if they had less expertise.  It was the fear that Beria was positioning himself to make a power grab that prompted the coup rather than to depose him as heir apparent.",2,0,1444639639,1444720721
cvw8l32,1,t3_3od4o0,DeSoulis,"Because the SR didn't start the Communist revolution in Russia.

There were two Russian Revolutions in 1917, the February revolution caused the abdication of of the Czar was led by a broad spectrum of political factions in Russia, the SR prominent among them. This phase of the revolution was not Communist in character and ended with the establishment of a provisional government. At this point the Bolsheviks were a fringe far left party, with membership in (at very best) mere tens of thousands in an empire of over 162 million people.

The October Revolution however, was led by the Bolsheviks against the provisional government headed by Alexander Kerensky who was part of a ""right-wing"" SR faction. The Bolsheviks had greatly increased their strength and membership in the month following the February Revolution. Many ""left-wing"" members of the SR defected to the Bolsheviks but there was no doubt that Lenin and other Bolsheviks were in the driver's seat during the October Revolution. The Bolshevik's base of support came prominently from factory workers in St.Petersburg and Moscow, whereas the SR enjoyed more support in the countryside where the majority of Russia's population lived, but the support of the factory workers were much more important to winning the struggle in the capital. This was the revolution that led to the establishment of a Communist government in the capital and eventually, after a long civil war: most of the former Tsarist Empire.",6,0,1444599435,1444720721
cvv4mfe,0,t1_cvung92,DeSoulis,"I run into warriors more often than hunters but it's incredibly frustrating because teching against one means you lose to the other. The three big decks I go against are FH, CW and secrets paladin and all 3 feels so much more powerful than tempo mage.

It's frustrating because I feel that against control warriors defaults to you losing and you can only win when he draw well and he doesn't. And when you tech against it the face hunters kill you since your early game is weaker. I honest hate secrets paladin/control warrior more than patron because with patron it at least takes skill to play, but with secrets paladin it feels like he just plays whatever and always ends up outvaluing you with MC unless you drew incredibly well.",1,0,1444510879,1444720721
