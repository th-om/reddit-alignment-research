cvd0431,1,t3_3m8qtf,taylor_a_b,"People talk about it being inhumane for the state to take a life, but locking them away for decades is also inhumane. It's also paid for by taxpayers. If you have a repeat rapist or serial killer, ok, I understand. But there are other ways to get justice. Ancient societies had all kinds of remedies for erring citizens: payments to the victim's families, social shaming, exile, etc. I'm not advocating any one of them in particular, but I am saying that the Quaker-inspired approach of locking someone up so they can ""think long and hard"" about things does not fit all crimes and there are alternatives. But hey, it does fund the Prison Industrial Complex. 

So there's that.",4,0,1443127969,1444724574
cvczym4,0,t1_cvcz16q,taylor_a_b,"Well, unless you're working for neo-nazis lol kudos for your work. There is a lot of important work to be done and it is not easy doing it. Too often efforts go unnoticed and unthanked. I've been there. 

And that's really the whole problem I'm trying to solve. Issues posted here get a ton of visibility, a ton of anger - and my question has for a long time been: So, why can't we see who to support? Why can't we interact with them, see what they need, and make that post *productive*? Realistically speaking, an issue that gets a lot of attention on Reddit is really a demand for action - a demand with no connection to the ""supply"" of organizations that are in the trenches, taking flak, trying to change things. Same goes for any news article we link to here. As I said earlier I'm not trying to plug my web app, but this is exactly the kind of thing I want to address. And it seems like I am not alone.",2,0,1443127743,1444724574
cvcypi3,0,t1_cvcyghd,taylor_a_b,"Yes, exactly, and for the average American - I mean, do you think they know who to go to? *I* usually do, and it sounds like you do too. But we are both (it seems) very well engaged individuals. But for the average American who cares about these issues, but doesn't have the level of knowledge, engagement, or connections like the ultra-wealthy or political wonks, who or what exactly is supposed to help them? That small pharm lobbying org - I'm sure they'd kill for people to simply know they even exist and are combating this stuff.",2,0,1443125892,1444724574
cvcybd4,0,t1_cvcy7hm,taylor_a_b,"Who would you support to counteract ISIS? Or people like Martin Shkreli? The point is that there are a lot issues out there we don't like and can impact, but unlike the elites, who are well connected, it is rarely immediately obvious how to do that. Sure, there are a few well known organizations, but they are just a few.",1,0,1443125312,1444724574

RE question 1: Yup, that's the gist of how the site works: posting something on BytGov starts a chain-reaction to, at the end of the day, impact the issue that you want to stop or support. So, yes, it's similar to Reddit in that you can post any political issue. The difference is that BytGov then tries to connect you to organizations that you can support to help imapct the issue that you posted. 

RE question 2: Washington D.C. and state capitals are filled with organizations that are pretty much dedicated to one thing: influence politicians to set policy according to the org's vision. These organizations have some very dedicated people working in them, and the best funded organizations can have a lot of impact. The best funded are usually those with wealthy backers. They should, and can be, those with a lot of backers, via a system like BytGov. And so you have the potential for smaller, better organizations to get much needed funding  and start having greater impact. Put another way, part of the point of BytGov is to democratize the activities of NGOs, non-profits, advocacy groups, and some lobbying groups that, from the shadows, impact American policy.",1,0,1443098928,1444724574
