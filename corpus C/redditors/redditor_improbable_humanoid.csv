cvxu3ji,0,t1_cvxq5qf,improbable_humanoid,I don't get how anyone can play without jetpack and thermal detonator.... it's just too effective all around to not. I could see playing with ion shot instead of shield though.,2,0,1444711518,1444716326
cvxsxo0,0,t1_cvx4opb,improbable_humanoid,Have you even played the beta? 20v20 is perfect. 32v32 would be a clusterfuck.,1,0,1444709076,1444716326
cvxq4a2,0,t1_cvwthas,improbable_humanoid,"Yeah, but it's likely that Neelix is seeing the characters in Talaxian. Even with the educational advances made in the 24th century, gaining basic fluency in a foreign language is bound to take at least a few years, but speaking it at a native level like Neelix appears to would take at least 10. The problem being that learning a language still takes a lot of mental effort, and there's no real practical reason to except when UTs are on the fritz.",1,0,1444704247,1444716326
cvxol3a,0,t1_cvx8vpp,improbable_humanoid,"Yep. Vader is also more fun than Skywalker because the saber rush is a piece of crap. Saber throw is deadly though.

The maximum number of guys you want to face at one time is about five, though. Too many and someone will get lucky with a grenade. You basically want them to come at you in waves of about three or four.

The problem with hero pickups is that you waste a good 1/4th of your health just trying to get anywhere interesting from the spawn point.",17,0,1444701856,1444716326

cvxma9v,1,t3_3oelu3,improbable_humanoid,"IIRC, the food with the most overall nutritional value per gram is a special type of peanut butter designed to treat acute malnutrition. But regular peanut butter is pretty good too. 

Fat is not really a food, per se, but it has the most calories for sure.",1,0,1444698327,1444716326
cvxlx91,0,t1_cvwzyo4,improbable_humanoid,"At what point do you go from needing proportionately more energy to asymptotically (if that's the right word) more energy to accelerate? .9? .95? .99?

Could you get to, say, .5 C given enough time to accelerate with a modern ion engine and an arbitrarily large supply of propellant and electrical energy?",1,0,1444697771,1444716326
cvxkzwy,0,t1_cvxjonb,improbable_humanoid,"But they would have assimilated translation technology at some point, so it might be irrelevant. With the UT, learning foreign languages would be something done largely by scholars and incredibly conscientious people.",1,0,1444696341,1444716326
