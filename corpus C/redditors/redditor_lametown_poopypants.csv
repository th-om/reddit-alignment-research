You can pretend you are, but you're talking in circles and being snarky so if it makes you feel better to think you're better than someone you don't know and will never meet on the internet, kudos to you tough guy.  I know I made a spelling error a few posts ago which you corrected, thank god you're here doing the Lord's work and policing spelling on the internet.  

Also, you can choose to live in your fantasy world where the state of reality doesn't matter, but the rest of us don't live there.  Again, willful ignorance is a choice you can make, but I don't see why you'd do it.  You're so vastly intelligent and all, it's pretty stupid to ignore reality and supplant it with the fantasyland.

So you're just crying that people don't conform to your secular worldview?  Buckle up friend, I imagine life's going to be mighty difficult if this gets you this heated.

Can you also explain this one: ""**My point is entirely unrelated to how some people view marriage. My point is that people should not view it...**""  

You contradict yourself in the next sentence.  If it's not about how they view it, is it about how they shouldn't view it?

My point is that people should not view it as a religious thing because of the federal benefits granted by the government to married couples.
