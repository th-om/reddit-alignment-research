The ""outsiders"" that Democrats would get behind are people like actors, activists, or professors. Those types of people can make their way to the presidency, but unlike business moguls, they have to spend some time in government first.  ",1,0,1444657794,1444720389

I can see why you phrase it that way considering this point is complete baseless horseshit. Climate change debate is based on the urgency of the crisis, certainty of weather models, our nation's ability to affect global carbon levels, and finally trade offs that must be made economically. Christianity has nothing to do with it. 

In fact, the only prominent Christian response I've heard in relation to Christianity has been made by the Pope who says God calls on us to care for the planet he gave us by *attacking* climate change

>So many examples that I could up.

I'd love to hear those if Climate Change was the ""most grievous""

This is irrelevant. Up to even 10 years ago, legal same sex marriage was thought to be ""highly unlikely"". 

>b.) the war on drugs is a big mistake and not very popular on Reddit, so it seems loaded and pointless

I don't see the point you're trying to make. It is loaded. I'm trying to get a legitimate response why the two Wars are different if guns were treated as drugs are today. Are guns different than any other item people want in terms of creating a black market?

>Decriminalization of drugs is probably one of the best ways to decrease gun violence.

Now there is a legit point. Shouldn't that be one of the best arguments made whenever gun violence is discussed?",6,0,1444152327,1444720389

But it's exceedingly rare. Divorce is more popular than ever so your fear of bad marriages staying together is less than ever. This was probably common in the 50's (a time with alot less mass shootings btw). What is much more common are parents that couldn't handle difficult times or commitment and simply threw in the towel. In the meantime, they're children were damaged and were left less able to deal with life's troubles themselves. 

They also were (in many examples) front row witnesses to anger, hate, conflict and blame. *More often than not*, children suffer from divorce. I can't imagine you disagree with that.",0,0,1443816281,1444720389
