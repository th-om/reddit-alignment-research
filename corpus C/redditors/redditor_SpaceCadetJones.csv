cvxbqzn,1,t3_3ohbdo,SpaceCadetJones,"I wake up early and practice/learn about whatever is interesting me at the moment for an hour or so before work (whether it's music theory or digital signal processing). After work I usually focus on playing guitar/drums because I pretty much always have energy for physical activities like playing and instrument. Before I got into the habit of waking up early to learn things while my mind is fresh, going for a run really helped to give me a 2nd wind after work so try that. Otherwise just relax for a bit every day after work and then try to do just a little bit of composition. Maybe take a few breaks if you want to get more than a few minutes worth done but it's too tiring. Or just push yourself and make it a habit, and as the habit becomes more ingrained it becomes easier. A lesson I've been learning with building habits is that small daily wins are great. Even if you only practice for 15 minutes a day, you'll still make decent progress.

There's no real answer to this, you just have to figure out what makes you tick and how you can get work done despite having a day job. I recommend reading around about habits, procrastination, and work ethic and seeing what lessons others have learned that might help you.

But seriously, aerobic exercise for that second wind is a godsend.",4,0,1444681948,1444718318

Maybe try something really small to ollie over into grass, then move to a flat surface, or like Nerbyl said just some chalk lines.

cvrvfpx,1,t3_3nw8uo,SpaceCadetJones,"I think learning data structures and algorithms is important for becoming a better developer, but actually building things is much more important. From interviewing at a handful of smaller - medium sized companies I've only been asked 1 algorithm question, which was to write a search function for a binary tree (which is very trivial). My interviews have all been talking about projects I've done, my interests career wise, my personal interests and personality, and some have asked ""trivia"" type questions like ""explain what a pseudo selector in CSS is"" or ""what are some differences between TCP and UDP"".",3,0,1444260030,1444718318

Resources may have not increased, but we have gotten much more efficient at utilizing them which essentially means the pie is bigger. I agree we are fucked if we maintain our current trajectory, but that's an issue of thr western lifestyle being unsustainable in general and to make things worse were enabling the lifestyle through very unsustainable means.",2,0,1444068161,1444718318
