Dark Matter, material invisible (to us) that makes up a large part of the mass in the Universe, drives the cycle by reversing direction every gaggillions years or so.

Or so this theory proposes.

Obviously there is much more to all the physics involved here but that's the ""in English!"" Star Trek explanation.",2,0,1444707722,1444726456

>the debate over healthcare reform, health care cooperatives are posited as an alternative to both publicly funded health care and single-payer health care.

>It has been proposed as part of the health care reform debate in the United States by the Barack Obama administration as a possible compromise with Blue Dog Democrats (as well as with Republicans) in the search for universal health care in the United States.[2][3][4] As it is being proposed by President Obama and others, a future health insurance cooperative would not be government owned or run, but would instead receive an initial government investment and would then be operated as a non-profit organization.[5]

>There once were numerous rural health cooperatives established by the Farm Security Administration (FSA). Most of them closed or merged over the years, generally because they lacked a sufficient economy of scale (i.e., they were too small to function efficiently). Thus, **co-operatives currently have so little market share as to be ""invisible"".[8]**

Instead of offering more hours to part time employees, overtime to full time hourly, or hiring seasonal workers they are asking salaried employees to 'volunteer' to work an otherwise paid job that they never agreed to perform as part of their employment contract.

It's not just about the salaried workers but how this fucks over hourly workers.

This is nothing more than thinly veiled, creative, wage theft.

Of course this is why people used to be represented by Unions which prevented this kind of fuckery but then the Boomers went from stoned hippies into coked up yuppies and fucked everyone over.",584,0,1444366036,1444726456

And of course you might rethink that as the insurance companies starts jacking up your rates, not only because human drivers are incredibly high risk drivers compared to self driving cars, but because the risk pools that help spread the risk around and keep your rates low will start to shrink.

And that also assumes you never have a health condition that impairs your ability to drive ... You know, like old age.

And it also assumes that nothing will ever happen in you life that makes driving unaffordable for you.

*Que 'Crazy' Internet Rant*

And that is highly unlikely considering Silicon Valley is developing autos/AIs/Robitics/3D printers that are going to consume millions of high skill well paying jobs making millions in the US 100% unemployable.

When self driving cars roll out taxi drivers, uber drivers, truckers, are all going to become unemployed within a relatively short period.

And those jobs aren't going to be 'replaced', they are just going to be gone.

Transportation AIs will replace dispatchers.  Robotic maintanence centers will replace 'touchless' car washes and car repair centers. Software and Engineering AIs will replace the coders and designers.

You think outsourcing/H1B visas were disruptive and game changing? just wait until AIs replace outsourcing.

Everyone wants to know where the next big economic crisis is going to come from well, it's coming from Silicon Valley, it's being engineered right now, and when it hits it's going to make the Great Recession look like recess.

You think the anti-tech attitude in some parts of SF because some tech workers are moving is a problem now?  Wait until the tech they are building takes their jobs too.

Uber has already made taxi medallions, which used to cost hundreds of thousand of dollars, virtually worthless, taxi drivers are going to be even more pissed when self driving cars (already part of Ubers plans) replace human drivers altogether.",7,0,1444269662,1444726456

cvryeqr,0,t1_cvrxw3k,BDB_JCD,"Did I mention Uber, I was talking about drivers.

Human drivers with human problems that many people don't want to deal with, they just want a car to take them where they are going in the shortest time possible.

But yes I have had some of these problems with Taxi drivers, Uber drivers, Lyft drivers, and car services.

I have actually stopped even bothering with Uber when coming from most airports into any downtown.  To often (not always but often) the driver accepts the ride request and then you can see them just sit and sit and sit in the exact same spot for 10 minutes or more while there are a line of taxis ready and waiting for me instead.  

I have had car service drivers show up reeking of booze.

I know SF cabbies and see them in bars drinking and getting high and then going out to pick up fares.

And I cannot tell you the amount of time taxi drivers have given me attitude because they saw me with luggage, thought they were getting a sweet airport run, and instead I am just going a short distance from the office to the hotel.

Finally, what ever Uber/Lyft/Whatever was the quality has clearly gone off the rails when I get driver after driver who doesn't know basic landmarks, are totally reliant on GPS, and generally don't actually have a clue where they are going, causing them to spend more time staring at their smartphone than at the road causing them to jam on the breaks, make sweeping multi-lane lane changes, or just generally drive poorly.

Do you really think that more than a few of your Uber X/Lyft drivers aren't baked?  Or that their water bottle isn't filled with Vodka?  

Because I can tell you, plenty of them are.",-1,0,1444264971,1444726456
