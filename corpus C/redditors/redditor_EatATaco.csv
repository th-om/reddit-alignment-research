cvx6i3o,1,t3_3ofoyw,EatATaco,"I started running a bit back. It had been so long that 1.6 miles (my first run) was incredibly painful. I kept upping it every day and, at some point, I decided that I probably should follow some kind of training regime.

So I did some research and came upon the couch to 5k program you are talking about. I was like ""I should totally do this. Let me convert my last run to see how close I am to 5k. . . Oh, my last run of 3.5 miles was actually more than 5k. Well, okay then.""

That felt pretty good, as I am sure yours did as well.",1,0,1444674434,1444731402
