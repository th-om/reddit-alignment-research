But you can't get at them, because they will help you kill their enemies and then tell you it was your plan, it's some inception level shit, ask the average american why we went to Iraq and they will mumble something about freedom fries. Our greatest enemy is the world government zionists.

cvtoarj,1,t3_3o2txa,seius,"I don't so much agree with her, what does having moslems and mosques have to do with European hegemony? This sudden rush to globalisation and mixing of cultures is moving way too quick for comfort, and it's transforming what essentially is 'europe'. I think that especially eastern europe, that has problems of it's own, should be careful not to add to existing problems. Lets unite europe with a common creed and culture before we try to integrate the middle east with all their violence and hate. Also, if these immigrants want assylum, why should mosques be built? Why shouldnt they be expected to assymalate into european culture?",-7,0,1444398806,1444727533

cvsiu9t,0,t1_cvsi0cu,seius,"It gets rid of tariffs, the intellectual property rights stuff as bound to have ACTA PIPA SOPA language all over it. It deregulates markets and makes off shore accounts even easier. Basically solidifying power of multinational conglomerates. This reduces our abilty to remain competitive and just means more of the same shit products made overseas. It's the wholesale giveaway of everything that is american and just makes us another used up european power. The fact that there are international secret courts proposed that can make decisions on lawsuits over 'potential losses' of corporations is the most undemocratic thing i have ever heard of.
