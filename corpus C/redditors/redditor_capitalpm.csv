cv2avx6,0,t1_cv28xlm,capitalpm,"I can see your point, and completely agree with your example that all bikers (motorized or not) should wear helmets. I also agree that everyone relies on everyone else, and people rarely think about this when making decisions. The problem I have with this is who gets to decide when you've risked too much? Using similar logic, you could say wearing a helmet while driving a car reduces the chance of death and serious injury in the event of an accident. All of the arguments you've made would match this new idea exactly, and this would provide an even greater benefit to society. (Don't have a source for this, but I'm fairly certain more people die /are injured in car crashes every year than in bicycle accidents.) Would there be any support for this idea? 

This is an example of a point someone else brought up elsewhere, people are fine with regulation if it improves their lives while only affecting others. This is partly why I wouldn't want society explicitly determining what I should and shouldn't do.",3,0,1442324347,1444728685
ctzojcn,0,t1_ctzhuqg,capitalpm,"Aerodynamically, probably not. They're fairly flat relative to the direction of travel, and don't seem to have any camber (curvature) to them. However, that whole assembly is going to add a ton of drag to the bike, making acceleration a lot slower. Also, the added weight being so high up will throw off the normal center of gravity, which could make for some interesting handling. The style points definitely make up for all of that though.",2,0,1439331332,1444728685

crf9swu,0,t1_crf86ae,capitalpm,"Fair enough. I've never played much of dota or similar games, but that's probably a better class of games to compare to. Does that pause happen if someone quits mid game as well, or only at the beginning? Because Tagpro does have a pause at the beginning where players in an uneven match can choose to quit without getting a DC (I think?). 

With all that, I'd still say waiting for even teams, if not 4v4, is the norm with uneven starts being the exception. I'd say that's a pretty solid example if good sportsmanship in the community.",1,0,1432135232,1444728685
crf7g5x,0,t1_crf5bp2,capitalpm,"I would say the fact that waiting EVER happens (let alone that I'd argue waiting is the norm, not the outlier) is a sign of a pretty solid community. I don't play a ton of online games anymore, but I've never seen waiting because of unfairness in any other game as far as I can remember. Think about it, when was the last time you even checked if the teams were even while waiting for a CoD/CS/etc. game to start? I know FPS games aren't great examples to compare to while talking about toxic communities (as well as their different scales of team size when compared to Tagpro), but it helps illustrate the point.",6,0,1432131141,1444728685
crbwa9s,1,t3_3696q5,capitalpm,"Depending on how recent the technology development needs to be, you have a lot of options. A good way to blend military technologies and societal impacts would be looking at drones (I know, I know, UAV/UAS, but we've already lost that linguistic fight) and their current and near-term impacts on a variety of industries. Particularly useful technologies here include advances on energy storage technology (batteries, fuel cells, etc.), electric propulsion, and autonomy/cognitive behaviors.

If your looking more for environmental impacts, you can try looking into NASA's ERA, Environmentally Responsible Aviation, program. There are a number of technologies under development there covering many different aspects of an aircraft. A lot of the work should be publicly available, but its focus is on maturing technologies for future systems. I'm not sure if this would fit into your scope, by it's a pretty interesting program in general.

Best of luck!",3,0,1431869212,1444728685
cqpjhoh,1,t3_33yeax,capitalpm,"Honestly, aerospace was the first engineering option listed on the PSAT list of expected majors. My high school self thought, ""(air)planes and rockets are pretty sweet. I'll try that!"" Worked out pretty well for me, but probably not the best advice to follow. 

Just know that your first choice isn't necessarily your only choice. Try to find something that matches up with your interests and talk with someone working in that field. If you find you've made the wrong choice after a year or two (or three or four, etc.), it's never too late to change your mind. It may set you back from being out of college and on to the ""real world"", but your future self will thank you.",1,0,1430082527,1444728685
