cvxoxfm,0,t1_cvvl2cj,HarbingerDe,I don't think there's a such thing as being overly critical of the 90 day report. ,2,0,1444702405,1444722624

As for the long exposure photos, it's not going to be rotating all the time, just during the bulk of the transfer.",1,0,1444619576,1444722624
cvwcreg,1,t3_3ocu8x,HarbingerDe,"Does anyone else have an insanely good relationship with their fundamentalist mother, and just wishes they didn't hold such outlandish beliefs? 

We're like best friends, we watch the walking dead, arrested development, we can talk about almost anything. And then every now and then it just comes to a topic like evolution or LGBT rights and I just kind of nod and silently agree.",2,0,1444606621,1444722624
cvw73uh,0,t1_cvvozu2,HarbingerDe,"The Hermes is the movie is probably the least realistic thing in the entire movie (Not counting gale force martian dust storms). It's something that would cost billions upon billions of dollars, much more expensive that the ISS, which itself cost **150 billion dollars**.  We're talking **the better part of a trillion dollars.**

The government would rather have killed each crew member, and replace them with advance robotic clones (That they had just months to develop), than have them divert the Hermes and employ risky explosive decompression tactics.",2,0,1444597051,1444722624
