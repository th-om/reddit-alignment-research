Eric is far more relatable in that way, he went to school, hated some aspects of it etc., then went home and did whatever shit that he did (I don't know much about him because I don't really care about him). My point is, the life Eric had (from what I do know) is something that even I can relate to on some level. I could more easily imagine myself being an Eric Harris than I could a Ted Kaczynski for this reason.",3,0,1444699170,1444723303
cvxmhbx,0,t1_cvxc5t5,i_lack_imagination,"It's true, but it makes me wonder if it might deter some people and those that it doesn't deter might mean that there will be more explosive attacks. Even when you look at this article, it's laying out that people are following a plan that was made by others, using the same weapons and strategies etc. that the Columbine shooters did.

It's possible you could see someone who would have been satisfied just shooting up his school to be motivated enough to learn how to build explosives and develop better strategies for those if he can't get access to guns. And the key part here is that these guys are documenting the things that they do now. They're writing manifestos obviously, but also telling people how they plan to do it, and in doing so, telling others how to do it. They could be the next Eric Harris in terms of who people start looking to hero-worship or follow. This could in turn make improvised explosions not nearly as difficult to pull off in the future as they are now.

I do think that it makes the incidents less likely, which overall can be a good thing, but I also think it's naive not to recognize it opens up a new avenue of violence, one that is potentially even more scary than guns. What happens to the guys who are not motivated enough to learn and plan out a more complicated explosion attack but might have been motivated enough to use guns if they had access to them? I don't know, maybe they suffer silently for a little while longer and they slowly go back to the right track, maybe they just kill themselves and no one else, maybe they become even more mentally screwed up and become serial killers, maybe they just scrape on by through life not really getting better but not making any violent splashes.

Restricting access to guns just seems like people want to ignore all the other reasons why these people get this way, because it's too hard to figure out. As this article highlights, sometimes they don't share any common backgrounds or life experiences, how can we address that? Maybe some people think that we can just restrict guns and then try to solve those problems, and that's a good idea, albeit I think maybe a little over optimistic. Most people only want to address problems that affect them, once the problem no longer affects them, they don't care anymore. Arguably IMO that's part of the reason we see a lot of these mass shootings in the first place, people have a problem with society or a portion of society, something relatively non-specific so they target people indiscriminately, and these problems that they have are often ignored, and they know one of the best ways they can get the spotlight on them, on their problems, is to just go kill a bunch of people. Suddenly the nation that didn't know you existed, that didn't know anything about an idea that you have, turns all their attention towards you and hears what you have to say. It's not just the media printing the names of the killers, even if they never said the name of the Isla Vista killer, everyone knew why he did it. He was jilted by women and hated women. He was caught up in a culture of overvaluing sex and how it represents masculinity etc. No one wants to hear this though because either they only lightly contribute that culture or they don't want to examine themselves to realize that they do, or they are engrossed in that culture and don't want to be told that it might be wrong.",3,0,1444698618,1444723303
cvwuipm,0,t1_cvwtig7,i_lack_imagination,"Even that wouldn't really be that great. It would be like driving in a tunnel, which I think for long distance driving could have some drawbacks as well as the amount of distance it covers just being a bit more problematic, and even if there aren't that many drawbacks, is there really much benefit to be had there? Solar farms are better if you're looking for pure energy gain, as you are choosing areas where sun hits most and are arranged more optimally.

The main reason why these solar panels are still useful in a parking lot is because it helps keep the cars cool which I think most people would find to be quite beneficial. Sure you could just do this without the solar panels, but that's not going to recover costs unless it were in a business parking lot and it got them more customers. Yeah maybe it's not good business to wait on the long ass time it takes to get returns through the solar panels, which is probably why you won't see many of these being utilized like this.",4,0,1444653568,1444723303
cvvqi1t,0,t1_cvvq2nm,i_lack_imagination,"I know a lot of people do that, I think the difference is that even in pubs, Envy expects people to listen to him. He even tells his teammates that he is the pro and they aren't. It's true, he is very likely a better player than any of his pub teammates, but if he's going to play that way, then he's not playing as a pub player like the rest of us. 

He'll tell people to listen to him, if his suggestion doesn't work out, or gets his teammate killed etc., then it's more along the lines of that ""whatever"" attitude. If his teammate doesn't listen, it's rage and they're stupid for not listening to him. No ordinary pub player demands that kind of respect where they are default considered shot-calling captain, if you call something and your teammate doesn't listen, maybe he is an idiot or maybe he isn't, maybe you don't really know what you are doing and people aren't going to blame him for not listening to some random pub player.",3,0,1444565877,1444723303
cvvo9ne,0,t1_cvvnvga,i_lack_imagination,"I remember when I first started watching Demon stream not that long ago, hearing all the things about Demon being pretty good but also throwing a lot etc., I couldn't believe what I was seeing on his stream. He was making some of the dumbest plays/moves I've ever seen, and he was on a big losing streak the first few games even admitting that he was on tilt, but occasionally I'd see him turn those dumb moves/plays into amazing plays. After watching him for awhile longer I started to get a better picture of what ""demon dota"" was and it's exactly as you said, an incredible play or a clowny failure. It's really pretty entertaining to watch and it seems like a play style I haven't really noticed anyone else showing.",7,0,1444556180,1444723303

cvvkcge,0,t1_cvvj62d,i_lack_imagination,"I don't know what the market research might say about it, but the huge value in convenience I think is limited to a small amount of people in a small amount of situations. That's not enough to be financially sustainable.

You also have to consider that the selection is always going to be far more limited than what you can get through online shopping. They just simply won't have the space to keep a large selection of items. This greatly devalues the convenience aspect as it further limits the situations in which it is helpful.",1,0,1444541398,1444723303
cvvk85d,0,t1_cvvi88n,i_lack_imagination,"That's not what I was driving at. What I'm saying is that placing products on physical displays occupies more space than having them stored in a warehouse. The priority of space in a warehouse is to maximize the amount of products that can be stored as well as maximizing organization to allow for speedy access to delivery etc. Space in a retail store is compromised by setting it up so that customers can browse and look at the products for sale, and naturally this display leads to a less efficient method of storing items. 

So they will have to mark up the products more to pay for this, and they will likely have far less of an item selection because it takes more space to store the same amount of items that an online seller would need because they can store their products more efficiently. The lower item selection makes them far less reliable as a result, and thus makes this even worse of a proposition. You can drop by the store to look for an item and find out that they don't have it, or just not bother checking and order it online. Sure a lot of retailers have improved at updating their in-store stock on their websites, but it's still not perfect.

For some products, physical display setups are far more worthwhile to the customer than other products. For example, in most cases, I don't really need to see a computer component in-person to judge whether or not I want to buy it, a picture and spec list is often good enough so I'm not going to be willing to pay a premium for a retail store service. However that is often not that great when it comes to clothing or some food purchases, so paying a premium here is something a lot of consumers find to be worth it.",2,0,1444541087,1444723303

Even if those were the types of regulations that take place in the counties where prostitution is legal, they seem fairly lackluster. From what I've read, the people who run/own the brothels in Nevada seem like pieces of shit. One of them seems like he tries to emulate Hugh Hefner except he somehow seems scummier about it. I feel like the setup they have in Nevada still allows for more exploitation than there should be in that business.",1,0,1444521676,1444723303
