When did I insult you? Your go-to argument tactic is to say something controversial in the hopes the other person will insult you. Then you get to say ""that's an ad hominem attack"" and you win.

I don't think you actually believe anything you're saying. I think you just like to argue and get people riled up. The character you're playing is too one-dimensional though. You need to step it up.",0,0,1444611025,1444729813

cvwe855,0,t1_cvwdt56,DannyXopher,"Well, for one, you didn't even try with your sources. 

You see, none of your sources addressed the science of why satellites can't exist. These random youtubers focus only on how these videos and photos could be faked. I could analyze one of your childhood photos and ""debunk"" that the picture was ever taken too... Except that there's absolutely no evidence behind it. 

If you rummage around a haystack long enough, you can convince yourself you found a needle. One of the pieces of evidence in the ISS fake video was that people can't go that long without a proper shower... ",0,0,1444609443,1444729813

cvwbx53,0,t1_cvwb7lq,DannyXopher,"Saying that propaganda is a tool in warfare then using that as proof for satellites being fake is quite the logical jump. 

Please show your sources on this. 

What is your explanation for the ISS? What makes you say it's not apparent someone lives there - and why does that matter to your argument? 

How many people do you think are in on this hoax? Millions of mathematicians, rocket scientists, pro/am astronomers? What are people actually studying when they go to school in rocket science? 

You still have not explained why getting a satellite into orbit is physically impossible. ",2,0,1444605097,1444729813
cvwahya,0,t1_cvw8uyp,DannyXopher,"So if GPS was invented on the ground, why would they start lying and say it was satellites? 

They did use satellite imagery when looking for MH370 in the ocean. They thought they could use the large areas the satellite covers to search for relatively static debris. As far as using imagery for proving crimes were committed - The satellites are traveling more than 15,000 MPH, and they take images over large areas every couple seconds and stitch them together. The fastest satellites complete their orbit in 90 minutes. That does not seem like an effective tool for proving crimes, does it? 

You also didn't address my question about why amateurs can spot the ISS through their telescopes. 

I question your understanding of physics if you think satellites in orbit are loopholes. Or you're just fucking with me.

Bruised always reminds me of how much change can hurt. It's comforting when life throws me curveballs. Just one more plane ride and it's done.

La La Lie is a song I would listen to with my best friend in college any time either of us needed cheering up. 

Rescued.... Rescued is my favorite song from the album. I listened to EIT a ton, but only ""discovered""  Rescued when I started dating this girl. I loved the melody of it, and always associated it with such a good feeling. Her and I broke up, and the song took a different meaning. It was the perfect song to wallow in sadness - ""I prefer not to be rescued."" 

Now Rescued is the perfect mix of good melody, nostalgia, happiness and sadness. I get the strangest feeling when I listen to that song, and I wouldn't have it any other way. ",0,0,1444545150,1444729813
