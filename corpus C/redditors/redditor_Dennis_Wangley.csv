Classic Clinton defense. If pleading ignorance isn't working for you, try pleading incompetence. So now not only did she try to destroy evidence, she failed it it!",3,0,1443037800,1444723163
cv6brvz,1,t3_3lhagm,Dennis_Wangley,"People like to use the code words, but everyone knows that by ""impoverished"" you really mean black. You are trying to say that the more black babies get aborted, the less crime there is. 

I guess that actually was Margaret Sanger's stated goal when she started Planned Parenthood, so Mission Accomplished, I guess. ",2,0,1442612214,1444723163

In this case though, Sanders is not covering for his wife or enabling her behavior, so I'm not going to judge him on it. ",8,0,1442372757,1444723163

cuqteky,0,t1_cuqm4d9,Dennis_Wangley,"I've seen this statistic posted before. There are 750,000 police officers in the U.S. with ""arresting authority"". Assuming that they work 250 days a year, and have (say) five interactions with a member of the public each day, that is 937,500,000 encounters with the possibility of an incident. And many of those encounters are with violent criminals.

If you list 3 or 300 incidents, that is a very, very tiny number. Stating that police are *often* murdering people and getting away with it is ridiculous. ",1,0,1441397276,1444723163
