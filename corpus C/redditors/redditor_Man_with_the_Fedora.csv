cvxg4yn,0,t1_cvxb04n,Man_with_the_Fedora,"Columbus thought he had discovered a route to the Indies i.e. India and the Malay Archipelago. Amerigo Vespucci was the one to correctly identify that the Americas were separate continents from Asia, hence why they are named the Americas and not the Columbias. This also why the Caribbean is referred to as the West Indies once the mistake was discovered, to differentiate it from the real Indies, which went on to be called the East Indies.
