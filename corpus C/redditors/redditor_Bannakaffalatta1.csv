I mean, that's the basic concept of a government. You sacrifice some liberties for safety.

That's a really bad blanket quote.

Edit: And to make matters worse, you're said the quote wrong and in doing so taking it completely out of context as /u/Gullil pointed out.",2,0,1444674160,1444723393

cvvydpb,0,t1_cvvqprv,Bannakaffalatta1,"Well some of that comment just isn't true at all. 

For instance the assumption that he never wrote high, the prologue of Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail has him yelling at Rolling Stone workers that if he doesn't get enough Speed that the book won't get written.

Like most things, the truth lies somewhere in between. ",1,0,1444583750,1444723393
