cvhmols,0,t1_cvhhsj2,commenter1126,"> The problem is that college students have any thing of value, so they could just take on student loans, file for bankruptcy and call it good. That's basically what all lawyers did before it became illegal.

rates of default from student loans were never different than normal loans.",0,0,1443492061,1444722711
cvhm79f,1,t3_3ms1b9,commenter1126,"I've had dual void batteries for a year or two now, and I just can't find a build that uses them to greater effect than two good (or even mediocre) rare wands. Void batteries don't have projectile speed and the -% spell damage until it ramps up is killer. You will spend a lot of time just trying to get those power charges back regardless of setup, when a rare wands build would just instakill everything in one shot anyway.

Dual VB is, as crazy as it sounds, 'too much' damage. not worth the tradeoff",2,0,1443491308,1444722711

You live in the US, so divorce him and take the house, his money, and put him into indentured servitude for you. Jade will leave his impoverished ass right quick.

cvhc6he,0,t1_cvhb5zf,commenter1126,"> The point being, people do make less than they did 40 years ago, but in general, we also live a far more ""extravagant"" life style than we used to.

Please side with me in cutting this shitty argument out of the discourse. You know why I play video games? Because I CAN'T GO OUT AND DO ANYTHING ELSE. Movies are fifteen goddamn dollars. Food is triple the price it was five years ago. Everything is so expensive video games are the only option. This is NOT leisure time, and having a fridge, phone, and TV just puts us in MORE debt, not less.

We deserve double the wages we have now. Double.",6,0,1443474728,1444722711
cvh0vnp,0,t1_cvgxpcd,commenter1126,"> During the period in which the top marginal rate was nominally 90% (1943-1963), income subject to this rate (>$200,000) never represented more than 1% of total Adjusted Gross Income. You can tax that 1% of income at 100% if you want and it still wouldn't make much of a difference to the big picture.

Guess what? Instead of making that money personally, they reinvested it. That's *the point.*

Instead of that, we now allow individuals to rake in billions and become so rich they distort the economy and our political system.",0,0,1443458343,1444722711
