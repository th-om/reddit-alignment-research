cvsdx8b,0,t1_cvsav8e,Aureliamnissan,"> Whereas Clinton and her supporters recognize that political reality 

The problem a lot of people have with these candidates is that the ""political reality"" your referring to is that pretty much nobody gets anything done anyway.  Pretending that everything is going to grind to a halt because Bernie gets elected is a bit disingenuous when we are once again facing a government shutdown because even in a relatively status quo administration like Obama Congress can't function.  It's not as though Hillary is going to have the magic dust to get the republicans to agree to anything. In fact it would probably be even harder to get them to agree to things because it's *Hillary* (a lot of republicans have that and ""Clinton"" as a slur right up there with ""socialist"").


As for not having plans to get things done I would submit that unlike most of the other candidates out there at least he has a solid running platform of all of his ideas and plans for funding /accomplishing them which is more than pretty much any other candidate can say.  That doesn't mean he will have nigh success in getting any or all of it done but even of he only managed to pass an infrastructure overhaul that would be a huge economic boon for this country. Is anyone else proposing anything even remotely like that?


That and the fact that pretty much everyone rise running is considered a hawks  and a lot of people aren't ready to get sucked into another conflict we can't afford. ",4,0,1444306748,1444720657

Want to look at the richest Americans?

Look I fully appreciate the value of these companies in our lives, but one has to realize that these types of companies are *not normal* in the American economy.  

Google specifically has the mantra ""don't be evil"" 

SpaceX and Tesla  Elon specifically did not want to open these companies up to public trading until he absolutely had to because of the profit motive of shareholders which would completely impede his ability to do the great things you've seen done. This was less of a factor with Tesla, but it really speaks volumes that SpaceX still hasn't had an IPO even though they are in regular competition with Boeing and Lockheed. 

The problem is that even with all of the exceptional examples you've listed they barely register on the US""s GDP combined

Compared to Chevron, Phillips, GE, Lockheed, Northrup Grumman, P&G, Ford, GM, and the countless major banks across the country there are loads of examples of abuses and companies relying on government subsidies and tax loopholes like a crutch. 

I guess what I'm saying is that you can't just point to Tesla, SpaceX, Google, and all of the small tech startups and claim that everything is a-OK. Most of the economy isn't remotely connected to those sectors. I'm not trying to claim that we are useless, just that we could do a lot better. ",12,0,1444181159,1444720657
cvqrpk8,0,t1_cvqqy69,Aureliamnissan,"I think what a lot of these posters are referring ITT is that all of the normal examples of American exceptionalism like the ones you just put forth are all from 35+ years ago. New horizons is recent but anymore the funding for NASA is quite paltry compared to what it used to be, which while it used to be blown out of proportion is now barely visible.  

People see the trend from companies that work to build a legacy and benefit the world as a whole to those that are more concerned with turning as much of a profit as possible.  As /u/voiceinthewilderness said most people are fat more suspicious of corporations than they used to be and with good reason in my opinion. ",18,0,1444179264,1444720657

cvmbgfn,0,t1_cvma8do,Aureliamnissan,"Fair point on the bomber as a negotiation point, but I have a hard time imagining that there wouldn't be any hard feelings about holding the country hostage to cut funding to one of the democrats' success stories. I'm sure people would probably forget eventually, but if we agree on the fact that there have to be large scale negotiations going on about big budget issues then why even bother with the debt ceiling.

cvm9ova,0,t1_cvm8afn,Aureliamnissan,"I guess the gist of what in trying to say is that there is no reason to expect that cutting a small program costing 2-300 is going to ""turn the tide."" If anything it seems like it would make future negotiations even more difficult as far as spending cuts on things that actually matter. Do you think democrats would bend an inch on something like Medicare or social security if the Republicans take planned parenthood away in a hostage situation?  It really sends like the only possible takeaway is an almost purely ideological victory that will cost more in the long run. 

>The biggest ticket items are social security and Medicare. I'm fine with cutting those, but whenever it's brought up, the Democrats use it as a campaign slogan to get people to vote for them.

To be fair republicans are the same way about cutting military contractor spending, and raising taxes to deal with the shortfall. ",1,0,1443829413,1444720657
cvm87ha,0,t1_cvm6jvz,Aureliamnissan,"> Which are two things your side wants and nothing my side wants. How is this a compromise? 

That was just an example not necessarily what must be done. My pint is that you have to find ways yo cut away at big ticket items rather than just quashing a bunch of really small stuff. Part of the reason I believe this is what must be done is the fact that the infrastructure in this country isn't really doing so hot and our spending on that is already at a minimum. The problem with feeling like you are making big gains with small cuts is that there are future expenses like rebuilding infrastructure that are likely to come up that will completely crush any gains made on small projects.

cvm68p5,0,t1_cvm6175,Aureliamnissan,">Isn't that better than cutting nothing? Yes, reversing the trend is exactly the first step. When you're careening down a hill, trying to get to the top isn't feasible, you have to slow down first.  

This would be like throwing a handful of sand in front of you in an attempt to slow down, not applying the brakes.  Applying the breaks would be like raising taxes and cutting back on military contractor spending.

>Are you saying that if we were going for hundreds of billions in cuts, it would be worth it? If the Republicans were willing to not raise the debt ceiling unless, say, Medicare were ended, that would make sense?

At the barest minimum it would have an actual affect on the debt crisis rather than just stroking your ego at the expense of others. So, yes in a way it would make a bit more sense, but if anything this just serves to highlight the point that the *only* way anoybody is going to cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending is by having long drawn out negotiations.

Might as well actually try to acheive something instead of pretending to deal with the debt crisis only to withdraw at the last minute (which is what everyone honestly expects will happen).

cvm5vat,0,t1_cvm4sno,Aureliamnissan,">I'd be happy with a small amount of cuts if they were actual cuts.

See the problem with a small amount of cuts is that when they target something like planned parenthood it achieves very very little.  Essentially it would be managing to cut a program that many people use, while leaving them with no alternative to turn to in many locations to achieve, what?  

Ideologically cutting something, anything is great because you can sit back and say that you've changed the trend, but at the end of you day you're still faced with the same problem, a burgeoning debt crisis with a no real change in the spending trend, except now everyone on the other side of the aisle *really* hates you instead of just kind of.  Unless you can figure out a way to cut programs numbering in the tens or hundreds of *billions* all you've managed to do is make many people's lives much more difficult to satisfy your own ego.  

I'm not trying to be an asshole, but really a few hundred million per year in spending cutting is not going to even noticably slow down the debt clock.  Unless you can really achieve something meaningful there is no point in holding the world economy hostage.",1,0,1443822343,1444720657
