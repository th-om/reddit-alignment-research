The current system is corrupt beyond believe. It cannot continue that a drug which costs thousands here can be had for a dollar in India and that we are restricted by law from purchasing from other sources. As long as the system is owned by big pharm, individuals on their own have no hope and are at their mercy. Responsible people will continue to lose everything and even die because of the inflated prices charged here.

Did Bush steal the election? No clue but what it is is what it is and what that is now is history. 

How does Bush compare to Obama? History will decide, not me.
