cvrhuro,0,t1_cvq218o,DF7,"The numbers change, but all studies show that biking on the sidewalk is significantly more dangerous than on a street. Its primarily because of the decreased visibility drivers have. People coming out of driveways, turning into driveways, and turning onto side streets all have a much harder time seeing you. In addition, sidewalks are usually designed for pedestrian traffic and as such often have sudden turns and obstacles. These make bikers move more unpredictably, making them harder to avoid.
