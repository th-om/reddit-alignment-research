cv9ufwg,0,t1_cv9swuz,10923823402341239,">I'm at university for biology, I can assure you that race is not a term used often

Yes, for political reasons.

>You're describing an isolated population, thing is that no significant population of humans has been isolated for several centuries now. Africa, Europe, and Asia have never been perfectly separated (except east Asia for maybe a few thousand years 50,000 years ago following a supervolcano eruption). Thus they do not qualify by your definition of race.

It isn't my definition of ""race"" (and I already said the term subspecies is more apt), and nor do you need to have an ""isolated"" population for this to be true.

>Moreover, ""race"" has absolutely zero predictive power.

Even if this was true (which it isn't; a person of African descent is genetically predisposed to sickle-cell anemia, for example), race would still have explanatory power, making it useful as a group.

>95% of human genetic diversity can be found within a population of any one ""race"".

So what? You are still more genetically similar to someone of your ""race"" than someone who isn't. You're more genetically similar to a chimpanzee than a rhino, that doesn't make species as a categorization useless.

>There are no examples of one race being shown to have unique or even differently-distributed qualities other than superficial qualities such as pigment and hair differences which have nothing to do with behaviour.

>You go on to use the term subspecies but there are no human subspecies, there is only one humanity. 

Yes, because to come out and advocate for humans to be grouped into subspecies would probably result in your immediate termination by your employer or university.

If you're looking at genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity, humans have [roughly the same amount of genetic diversity as chimpanzees](https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/woodley-2009-is-homo-sapiens-polytypic-human-taxonomic-diversity-and-its-implications.pdf), which allows for 3-5 subspecies, depending on the zoologist you ask.",1,0,1442893688,1444726184
