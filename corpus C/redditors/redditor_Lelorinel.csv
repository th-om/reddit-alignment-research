If you truly want to do law, go to an accredited school, unless you have direct family in law-hiring positions and don't want to work anywhere but for them for several years, let alone leave CA.   
   
Even students from T50 schools have a hard time finding well-paying (or even okay-paying) jobs. Look at the employment and bar passage statistics for your school- those are not odds anyone should take.

Not really- it's not like there can only ever be one exception to anything. It's present in other countries to some degree, I just see it most prominently in America.",5,0,1444223719,1444719589
cvqy4wp,1,t3_3nso9n,Lelorinel,"Yes, but not in the rah-rah, Star-Spangled-Awesome way that tends to come to mind when people hear the term.   

I think America's exceptional because of a lack of any overarching unity of identity- i.e., anyone and anything can be or become 'American'. Someone from anywhere in the world can live here and people will just assume they're from here unless something indicates differently.   

If I move to China, no matter how long I live there or how natively I learn to speak Mandarin, no one will ever think I, a white dude, am Chinese. America is not just a nation of immigrants, but a nation of *constant* immigrants- wave after wave of immigrants around the world have come here, and while they're uniformly greeted negatively by inadvertently-ironic 'nativists', they soon become yet another vibrant part of ""America.""  

I think that's exceptional because I think it gives America an excellent capacity for change. It's not perfect, and I don't believe there is a 'best' nation, but it's mine and I think that's pretty cool.",69,0,1444191110,1444719589

To be fair, Dagestan is [pretty much in the Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan)- there are very few ethnic Russians in Dagestan, the place is 83% Muslim, and it's in the Caucasus. Just hop over Azerbaijan and you're in Iran.",3,0,1444188921,1444719589
cvqcuma,0,t1_cvqbq55,Lelorinel,"Extending it to every single room on campus would be very expensive for negligible benefit. The vast majority of students would never ""have access to it,"" since they use wireless devices without ethernet ports and Umass has WiFi.   
Plus, WiFi slowdowns due to the upgrading process are not only infrequent but temporary. Umass doesn't need a redundant ethernet system even now, let alone once upgrades finish.",1,0,1444155815,1444719589
