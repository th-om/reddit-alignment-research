I'm sure there's some good academic research on extremism figures - maybe someone will post a link.

>Theres almost 2 billion Muslims on the planet. If the numbers stated in that dumb tweet were factual, you'd be dead or Muslim right now.

Where do you imagine these people will obtain their arms and supplies? And shit, the nations around Israel couldn't even defeat *it*. Do you think the significantly more powerful NATO would just... sit around? 

Even if 2 billion ""people"" (or however you'd like to call it out, i.e. every ""Muslim"" nation - are we counting the women and kids?) were well and truly pitted against NATO then, if necessary,  the US could dip into that nuclear arsenal. They have global reach in 30 minutes with weapons can destroy entire cities and nations - and that's not even counting the subs. Total war with the US is not winnable. ",3,0,1440572954,1444731972
