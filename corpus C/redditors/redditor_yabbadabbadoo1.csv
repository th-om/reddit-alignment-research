>For people making less than 50k they don't pay much as it is, so reallly the only people who benefit are people at the top of the bracket.  Chris Wallace called out Jeb on this issue and asked, ""do you really need a 3 million dollar tax cut"".

>What is more important, paying off the national debt or tax cuts for the rich?

 You don't understand how tax brackets work. Your first 50k as a married couple is zero tax, that's is a tax break, and a significant one for all Americans.




So the math, we make 100k married filing jointly. Standard deduction, but we will ignore that since I would take if on either the current plan or new Trump plan.

So its $10,312 and $6275 in the 25% tax bracket (25% of amount over $74900)

So currently I would pay $16,587 in federal income taxes. Again without deductions but that's the base.

Under trumps plan, I will be paying 0% on the first 50k, and 10% on the 2nd 50k for a total of $5000. So I'm going to save $11.5k or somewhere around there after deductions. And even if I go up above the 100k mark I still save more.

Every single person up benefits from Trumps tax plan, unless they are already paying zero. Every, single person. And I just showed you how a middle class person would effectively get another 10%+ annual salary under his plan. So no it does not just help the rich.

cvxe007,1,t3_3oh768,yabbadabbadoo1,"No chance of working unless he raises taxes significantly on the middle class and upper middle class. His corporate policies would set inversions into overdrive, companies would flee in record numbers and incorporate overseas for the best tax rates. The rich will also stash more money elsewhere because they have the means to do so and you can't prevent them from doing so. The markets would crash due to his proposed transaction tax aimed at the hedge funds, which also would destroy most index funds, ira and 401k accounts as well. 

I would expect tax revenue to drop overall due to the policies, even before his trillions in added costs.
