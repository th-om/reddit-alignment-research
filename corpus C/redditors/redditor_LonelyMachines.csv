cvwsnnv,0,t1_cvw8zbj,LonelyMachines,"> Maybe because they're actually called ""Modern Sporting Rifles""

I really dislike that moniker.  The 2nd Amendment isn't about ""sporting.""  By taking a self-defense/combat rifle and rebranding it as such, we're falling into a rhetorical trap.

We are meant to have access to *fighting guns.*  Calling them something else suggests we're receptive to restrictions on them.",8,0,1444647065,1444731914
cvws9yl,1,t3_3oejg2,LonelyMachines,"We tried this once.  We had a ban on the national level for ten years.  It did nothing to reduce gun crime and only served to create statutory ""gotchas"" to ensnare people who put the wrong ""features"" on their rifle.

cvwixmj,1,t3_3odls9,LonelyMachines,"Not really.  Atonality just became the hip thing.  Tonality never died; it just wasn't as *trendy* with the academics.

I'll throw Walter Piston's name in every chance I get.  Alan Rawsthorne, Paul Creston, Vagn Holmboe, and Miklós Rózsa both wrote great music that's tonal.  Newer guys?  Check out Jefferson Friedman, Richard Reed Parry, and Stephen Hartke.",2,0,1444617921,1444731914
cvwh8er,0,t1_cvwgirm,LonelyMachines,"Remember when you were young, you asked your parents an awkward question, and their response was, ""it's...complicated?""

Setting a date Rome ""fell"" is a bit like that.  476 CE is a somewhat arbitrary marker.  It's the year Odoacer deposed the emperor Romulus and established himself king of Italy.

Thing is, Romulus wasn't the last emperor.  A guy named Julius Nepos was emperor in name until 480.  Even after that, the actual transition wasn't all that disruptive.  Odoacer kept the Senate together and kept most institutions the same.  The only noticeable difference to people on the ground was that the guy in charge had a different title.

The eastern emperor Leo really didn't seem to mind.  At that point, the western empire only held a fraction of the territory it once had, and defending even that was a constant, costly burden.  

The decline and collapse could be argued to have started as far back as 192.  It was a *process,* not a singular event.  Outside the Roman political class or aristocracy, the only mention of it in regular conversation would have likely been, ""hey, that new guy in charge has a weird name.""",5,0,1444614895,1444731914

> Research in these locales [Oakland and Chicago] tacitly recognizes that seeing a psychiatrist or other mental health professional is a class-based activity not available in many low-income neighborhoods, and that in any case the insanity of urban gun violence all too often reflects the larger madness of not investing more resources to support social and economic infrastructures.
