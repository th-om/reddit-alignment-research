My understanding:

Ok, QE: Particles/Interactions for which individual components can't be described, only the entire system. Let's assume it's neutral thing, where it all comes out to 0.

Let's say we have two particles, quantumly entangled, with a total spin of 0. Therefore, one of them has spin -*x*, and one has spin +*x*. We'll use + and - for shorthand.

Seperate these two particles physically, distance doesn't matter. Observe one. It'll will have - spin or + spin. Instantly, no time passed at all, the other will have the 'anticorrelated' spin (Eg: The Opposite.)

Therefore, the Mass Effect writer says, *if there's a method of changing that particle's spin, the other's will also changed, instantly! Instant Comms! Ha ha!*

Problem: Read the QE definition again.

>Particles/Interactions for which individual components can't be described, only the entire system.

The issue is, one we observe one of the compnent parts, we can describe it. If we can describe it, it can't be, by definition, Entangled.

The Entanglement collapses.

It's not 'Particle A told Particle B that A was +, so B became -'. It's 'A is +, therefore B is -'.

The Particle's Spin is 'chosen' (bad term because it implies conscious thought, but it'll do) at creation, where the two particles are in the same location.

*QE can't be used for any form of Comms because, asides from creation, no information is exchanged between the two particles, and, in fact, once observed, cease to be entangled.*

Again, however, I am not a physicist, and wikipdia is not infalliable. If someone more versed and sourced would be able to back me up/tear me down, I'd appreciate it.",2,0,1444696174,1444726396
