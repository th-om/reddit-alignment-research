cv5xr9g,0,t1_cv5wjf8,austarter,The most successful companies through a combination of tax breaks and incentives are able to privatize the profits of running the most profitable industries among us while socializing both the risk and the costs at every opportunity (Of which there are many.) . The richest corporations which pay the lowest amount possible to their workers have a lower effective tax rate at the end of the day than the workers themselves. We subsidize corporations. It's what America is built on. ,6,0,1442590317,1444731728

Hmm. Strange phrasing, if true then your social Heehaws seem to come out in the way you verbalize yourself online as well. 

You sound young. The issue you described in your own words was one that put you as the common denominator in this track record of failure. You should look to books, or people, or really anything that will teach you a better way to be. I have ADHD as well. Ritalin for 6 years, but the way that I get around it is by trying to compete with it. Build a better attention span. Recognize with immediacy anytime that your brain failed you. Build habits that take this into account and know where your impulses come from and where they take over.
