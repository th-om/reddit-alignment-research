cvxt494,1,t3_3ojfa1,Lefaid,"American here. Last I heard, Canada was being taken over by neo con wannabes. What's going on up north? 

Edit: Wait there is an election in Canada tonight! How did I not know this!? ",1,1,1444709446,1444716969
cvxszlx,0,t1_cvxqvnf,Lefaid,"The sanctions did work because they were backed by many world powers. The purpose was to get Iran to negotiate their nuclear weapons and because of the sanctions, they did. Not to have the regime give up power and change the or entire government structure. 

It is also why going against the deal was a waste of time. Those sanctions wouldn't work if just the US was involved which would be the case if we backed out. ",1,1,1444709185,1444716969

cvxmpqm,1,t3_3ogibj,Lefaid,I have a lot of issues with AT&T near I225 in Aurora on three different phones. I get a ton of dropped calls. ,1,0,1444698981,1444716969

cvwp2su,1,t3_3of4g0,Lefaid,"I can sympathize with him admiring barriers being broken. I feel that way sometimes too.  It is uncomfortable how racial some positions are in American Football (for the opposite and more extreme case, see... I think it's CB or RB, I don't think about this too much.). I love how OP decides to yell about Political correctness so quickly and name calling. Helps OP lose credibility. ",23,0,1444632143,1444716969
