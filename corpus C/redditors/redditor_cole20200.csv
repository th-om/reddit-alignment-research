I think it's a real possibility that first contact might be with tourists, or long range traders, or some dudes on safari.",1,0,1444490485,1444731324
cvutld7,0,t1_cvui8pa,cole20200,"It's interesting to think, we might be the first other aliens they themselves have seen.  They come here, and just start walking around and flying their ships by others.  But once they see how freaked out we get, they take a step back and set up a stricter procedure for contact.  The surface becomes a non-civilian zone, and tourists can do high orbit flybys only.  Mean while other dedicated naturalists and biologists work from a concealed bunker somewhere on Earth prepping for formal contact.",1,0,1444490330,1444731324
cvutgom,0,t1_cvulo27,cole20200,"Snagging voyager would probably be an easy way for aliens to let just the right people know about them at first.  Instead of risking accidentally introducing yourself to a janitor at nasa, changing something about voyager will definitely only alert the scientists involved, then it'll be up to him who they tell.",2,0,1444490059,1444731324

cvutarq,0,t1_cvurxij,cole20200,"I'm not exactly convinced that the prime directive is even the right way to handle developing races.

Let's use the star trek context.  If the borg were sweeping through a sector, would the federation be morally obligated to evacuate any pre-warp races?  Let's say the cube there is gathering drones and actively setting up borg colonies, so you can be sure it won't leave them alone.

A dramatic event can sometimes bring out the best in humans, and why should an advanced alien race even care about our primitive culture?  It's probably pretty barbaric to them.  Besides, mission work does things like build schools, set up clinics, and expand awareness.  I'd much rather   get double barrels of the truth, then kick around here in the dirt.",2,0,1444489714,1444731324

cvu1w6i,1,t3_3o4f36,cole20200,"What a travesty.

The blame falls to one person, the person who I'm sure will never ever have to answer for their actions.  The Person in the foster care system who approved the child's adoption BEFORE it was legally determined if the parents were at fault.

I feel great sympathy for every else involved, the adopters, the parents, the law.  But that one person, even if it was within their position's authority and policy, is a disgusting excuse for human decency, a mockery of the very concept of human morality.",14,0,1444419628,1444731324

cvrcxup,0,t1_cvr02fn,cole20200,"I think this as well.  Once unskilled labor is nearly worthless, AND there is a automated solution in place, then basic income will start to get seriously looked at.

cvpb5oq,0,t1_cvp468w,cole20200,"This is just my own theory but you know what might of happened?  That speech might of been the actual inspiration for the military-industrial complex to build up in the first place.

So in the 60's picture a bunch of warhawk generals sitting looking at their new technology toys, and just wishing for more.  Then picture a bunch of industry tyco's sitting around hoping the cold war manufacturing boom would never ever end.  And finally, a group of policy makers wondering how to game money out the system in this new age of technology and progress.

It may seem sick, but I can imagine they looked back on Eisenhower's speech and thought that was a great idea!",3,0,1444077120,1444731324
