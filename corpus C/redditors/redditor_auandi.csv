cvxwanv,0,t1_cvxqmqp,auandi,"What is this weird rise of using ""cuck"" as the go-to insult? It seems to be coming from all the right wing places recently, and it's just weird. Not just 4chan/reddit either, it's starting to infest its way into the Republican primary. Die hards are calling people like Boehner ""cucks"" because he only wants to *feel* like he's in control while actually letting ~~the black man~~ Obama and the Democrats do whatever they want.

It's just creepy.",8,0,1444717597,1444728552
cvubvi6,0,t1_cvu8vy9,auandi,"But this is why we don't attempt to name or designate them this early, we are as a people really bad at predicting what's important and relevant to the future. Yes, internet great, but in the grand scheme of things it's not a defining part of this era, only a minority of the planet even has access to it.

The reason people suggest 1991 is not the internet, but a general end to rival ideological worldviews. Fascism had failed long ago, and now so had Communism. The world basically agreed on mixed market capitalism, even purported communist countries like China and Cuba have liberalized their economy to make it more mixed market. This has also made international business flourish, where large companies are now welcome in virtually all corners of the earth rather than simply part of the earth. It's meant that international trade has exploded, bringing the benefits and challenges of a truly global marketplace to the forefront. ""Information"" had nothing to do with any of that.

1991 is also around the time when the rate of growth in population began to decline. Across Asia, and not just because of China, people were having smaller families. Cities were swelling and city dwellers have smaller families than their rural counterparts, all other things being equal. This also created mega-cities in all areas of the world, not just the Industrialized world any more. In 2006, humanity for the first time in our history became majority urban, it used to be that cities would only swell as industrialism happened and drew in labor from the rural areas, but not any more. ""Information"" had nothing to do with any of that either.

1914 for example marks the end of an era not because of technology, but because of the historical events that have nearly nothing to do with technology. If we are in a new history, it is not because of the usenet that existed in 1991, it's because we reached what some dubbed ""the end of history"" with the collapse of communism and the near global agreement of mixed market capitalism. The internet's a neat tool, but it's one that only exists for a minority of the world and one that has not as of yet led to a new age. The pre and post internet world of 1992 and 2002 are not substantially changed at a global scale as a result of the technology. It could one day, but it hasn't yet and so trying to define this age as the ""information age"" isn't cheesy, it's inaccurate or at minimum premature.",1,0,1444436631,1444728552
cvts0g4,0,t1_cvtbeqi,auandi,"Thats such a bad analogy on so many levels I'm almost not sure where to begin.

First and most obvious, being punched causes harm. Losing a few meaningless internet points does not.

Second, being punched is easy to trace. I can find the exact fist and find the person who threw the punch. If someone gets a vote up or down, it's not something we can easily trace. It is however something that the *admins* can trace since they have the meta-level data and they have said repeatedly that because of the number of complaints against SRS they watch closely and find next to no vote brigading. And that if you have *evidence* you should give it to them because no one has ever given them hard evidence of this, only accusations that is not borne out by the data.

The better analogy would be standing in a river and splashing upstream. Sure you're making a slight difference to water volume, but if you ultimately aren't affecting the flow of the river does it really matter? If a tree downvotes in a forest, but the comment is still highly upvoted, does it really make any difference?",0,0,1444404857,1444728552

But in a sad way he's right. If they hadn't have openly admitted to the rape, OP would have complained that they posted names because ""too many men's lives have been ruined.""",19,0,1444346016,1444728552
