cvxra8e,0,t1_cvxpypn,Teelo888,"Well, yes, but like the guy above me said, we need ozone to protect us from UV radiation.

There has been some talk about spreading sulfates in the atmosphere as those particles are reflective and would prevent some warming too. It's estimated they have a lifetime of a couple of years, then would fall back to the ground. Could you imagine the ""chem trails"" conspiracy theorists though? Lol.",1,0,1444706130,1444727461

There has been a problem in climate scientist of systematic under-estimation of the effects because scientists don't want to labeled fear-mongers by people like you, so I really have no idea what you're talking about.",1,0,1444705307,1444727461

They are going to be in bad shape for a while if we go through an extreme transition. The US? China? We have the resources to adapt and transition without taking a significant GDP hit.

>  There are many limitations that renewable energies possess that make them pretty incompatible with industry and manufacturing. You need more stable forms of energy, ie fossil fuels or nuclear, to power factories and such.

I totally agree with this though. Advanced and developed countries *have* to begin using nuclear to supply manufacturing needs, or even at the very least natural gas.",2,0,1444704639,1444727461
cvxq6rp,0,t1_cvxjtr6,Teelo888,"> massive atmosphere scrubbers in less than 10 years that would be highly effective.

No, passive scrubbers are extremely ineffective. Recall that the composition of the atmosphere is 400 parts per *million* CO2. You would have to cycle 10,000 tons of atmosphere (yes there is a difference in molecular weight but lets keep it simple) to remove 1 ton of CO2. Last years global CO2 emissions were IIRC 32 billion tons, of which the oceans and forests removed about 12 billion tons. That's a 20 billion ton deficit and passive scrubbers can't cycle enough to remove any significant amount.

The best course of action is to first capture all the CO2 emissions straight from power generation plants and inject it underground. You're talking about exhaust that should be almost entirely CO2. You capture it and inject it underground in some rock formation and hope for the best. That's the best possible option we have now, but won't do much by itself without massive efforts to mitigate CO2 in every other sector as well.",1,0,1444704357,1444727461
cvxpvj6,0,t1_cvxomg1,Teelo888,"CFC's actually have a cooling effect on the atmosphere by increasing the Earth's albedo, namely over the ice caps allowing sunlight to reflect back out of the atmosphere with less impedance. There's the public health concern, however.",2,0,1444703854,1444727461
