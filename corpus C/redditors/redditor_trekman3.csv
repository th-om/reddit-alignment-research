cvwfq33,1,t3_3oe2h9,trekman3,"Jim Tomsula looks like an NFL head coach who makes more money than most of the people here joking about his appearance, and who will continue to do so even if he gets fired.",0,0,1444612246,1444721948
cvv49z9,0,t1_cvv3pky,trekman3,"On the contrary, not being aligned with any party was a coherent stance that accorded with the philosophies of most people involved in the Occupy Wall Street phenomenon. And it was not wasted. It expanded what people thought was possible in modern American politics. I did not agree with the economic ideas of most OWS supporters, but I agreed with them that the parties were corrupt jokes and that US foreign policy needed changing.",1,0,1444510254,1444721948

cvorapa,1,t3_3nie0f,trekman3,"Long time lurker here. I understand wanting to keep board standards high, but this mod comes off as oddly defensive. He has little pull, anyway. This is actually a very small forum for such a popular team. There are lots of other places to discuss the Niners. The official 49er message board doesn't censor so tightly, from my experience. At the end of the day, this is supposed to be fun. If it's not fun, there are plenty of other places to go to.",7,0,1444037565,1444721948

cvoqljf,0,t1_cvoq1qm,trekman3,That's interesting. I am no expert. Were the Ravens just experiencing a particularly advantageous confluence of contracts around the time of their superbowl run a few years ago? They could afford a great defense and a great offense. How were they doing it?,1,0,1444034144,1444721948
cvoqep7,0,t1_cvnxmhd,trekman3,"Quoth the prophetic voice,

When the gates of Boston are made open 

To unleash the great foulness, 

There will be need of the strong arm

And they will cry in the waste places

For the son of Manning

Then a great tribulation will come upon those who champion the dark one

Every part of the warrior's armor will receive the ball, 

The helmet will receive the ball, 

As also the gauntlet

In the halls of Brady there will be gnashing of teeth

They will pray unto forsaken spirits but have no refuge

Dark, dark night will come upon those who do not accept the glory of the son of Manning

Let us lift voices to praise the cheerful day, 

Amen",3,0,1444033260,1444721948
