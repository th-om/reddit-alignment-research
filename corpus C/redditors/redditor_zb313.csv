cvwx27g,1,t3_3ogbhz,zb313,"Give Ullmark a few games in Rochester to see how he does, if he continues to play lights out bring him up and platoon with Johnson. When Lehner comes back, either demote/waive Johnson and keep Ullmark up or send Ullmark back down.

Wouldn't be opposed to trading for Miller as a stop gap and so he can retire a Sabre, but that'll never happen.",10,0,1444659490,1444728766

cvo4a12,1,t3_3ngoao,zb313,"This is the most ridiculously over penalized team ever. What the fuck, Rex? Get your fucking team under control. A huge part of our lost games is because Bills players are getting flags thrown every other play. Unacceptable.",11,0,1443988733,1444728766
