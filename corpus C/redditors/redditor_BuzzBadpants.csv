cvw5m8h,0,t1_cvvm00s,BuzzBadpants,"Virtual servers don't typically need a lot of GPU resources. All the CPU code runs with basically no overhead, but the graphics device is basically just a software frame buffer. 

Virtualized GPU hardware does exist, but they need a virtualization layer to their memory structure, and they are relegated pretty much exclusively to enterprise markets. Though with that said, you can rent an instance from Amazon for about 50 cents an hour.",1,0,1444594784,1444730272

cvuyrik,0,t1_cvuabli,BuzzBadpants,"Awesome! Let's make it happen. I'm also a little worried about the cultural views about seeking psychiatry though. It's still very stigmatized. It's sort of expected that a ""well adjusted"" adult will never have to see a mental health counselor, and if they do, it's evidence that they're ""crazy."" We need to change this attitude before people will start voluntarily seeking help. Instead we've got soldiers killing themselves in droves while the VA twiddles their thumbs.",1,0,1444500096,1444730272
