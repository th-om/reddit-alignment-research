cvtsifs,0,t1_cvtrz2l,So-I-says-to-Mabel,"All predicated on the small chance you can get to your gun before you are incapacitated. I went to funeral for someone that could not. I don't need hypotheticals, I have a real life example of how a loaded gun didn't do squat to protect a man's life. In fact, he would likely be alive today had the thief not found his gun.

And let's not have the usual gun debate. I just get tired of these hypothetical scenario's that are as likely to happen to a person as getting struck by lightning or winning the Powerball. Most thieves just want your fucking TV, they don't want to murder you and your family. Let them have the fucking TV.

You like guns. Good. That's a good enough reason in this country to have a gun. You don't have to go all paranoid Rambo and say everyone *needs* it for protection. There are plenty of ways to protect yourself without resorting to buying a gun.

Oh, hypotheticals! I can play this too but let's make the scenario more believable.

Two men enter a single woman's home while she is sleeping (the most likely scenario) and because she's didn't hear a sound from their forced entry due to her refusal to by an alarm system because she was counting on her gun to save her, they walk right into her bedroom and rape and kill her. Yep, even a gun can be rendered useless when you don't take other non lethal sensible measures to protect yourself. 

Get an alarm system, get a dog, get into a better neighborhood, get a reinforced front door, bars on your window, get some self defense training but only get a gun if you are prepared to have it used against you, like my friend who died when the initially unarmed thief found his gun and used it on him.

>The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and **legal abortion**, regardless of ability to pay.

A legal abortion is prior to viability, unless there is a threat to the mother or the child is not likely to live. So that means your exaggerated claim is still false.

Get out more. We are having a conversation, not a debate. And the conversation is why vitriol is being thrown at you. My anecdotal experience of knowing people with religious convictions who can have a conversation without resorting to lies and distortions is beside the point. Focus on the real point. I called you out for lying.

> Ah, there's that vitriol against anyone with religious convictions.

That's your comment. And since you can easily browse your own comments, it appears you are lying again. To what end, I have no idea.

> resorted to unsubstantiated ad hominems

No, you being a liar is a fact I have proven many times. You lied about Democrats wanting on demand abortion. You lied about not saying vitriol. I didn't call you stupid, I called you out for the action of lying. 

Now one more time because reading comprehension doesn't seem to be your strong point.

I see, so not only do you use gross exaggerations to attempt to argue, you also misrepresent yourself as a person being attacked for being devoted to religious doctrine. Again, that is why you receive the vitriol. You are false, and there is no point in having a discussion with someone that can't be bothered to observe basic ethics.",1,0,1444248300,1444727493
