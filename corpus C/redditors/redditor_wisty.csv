The suffragettes burned down the house of an MP who wanted to give women the vote, along with other self-defeating tactics. Women only got the vote after the suffragettes shut down (during the war), and the suffragists (moderates) were able to speak up without being laughed at (suffragettes were used as an example of why women shouldn't have the vote).

cvwged3,1,t3_3oecak,wisty,"For context, Melbourne is the San Francisco of Australia (or the Portland - maybe Sydney is more like San Francisco).

Geelong is an industrial city just outside Melbourne, and it's a lot more working class.

Also, Victoria (the state) tends to be fairly classist - it's changed a bit, but there was historically a huge division between classes (unlike the other mainland states, where the only faux pax you could make in a pub was ordering an out-of-state beer, or cheering for the wrong team).

> Was wearing the Geelong mayoral robes to a new beer festival which he is privately backing provocative?

> You betcha!

> And don’t you think he knows that?

> Was it provocative to wear a T-shirt with a naked woman hitchhiking with the slogan “Gas, grass or ass, no one rides for free”.

> Absolutely!

> And don’t you think he knows that?

> Is it demeaning to suggest a woman has to pay her way by providing sex?

> Of course it is!

> Don’t you think he knows that?

> Was pushing the pictures out on his social media provocative?

> Of course!

> And, again, don’t you think he knows that?

> He might say that those who are upset by the way he chooses to represent Geelong are too easily offended or just members of the fun police.

> He might argue that such naysaying is typical of Geelong failing to embrace a new attraction and that all is fair as long as the steins are full and everyone is having a good time. He might say that he was at a private function.

> Who knows, he might even have had some of those arguments pre-prepared.

> Perhaps this is just another example of the no publicity is bad publicity mantra that Cr Lyons advocates in his autobiography.

> His provocative actions and demeaning T-shirt were always bound to kick up a storm.

> When you are mayor, you are mayor 24/7.

> And this is not how a mayor normally represents his city.

> And don’t you think he knows that?

Yes, he knows it will cause a shitstorm. And he wants the shitstorm, because fuck the easily offended haters, vote for Darryn Lyons.

A blue-collar city sitting next to Melbourne - could there be a certain demographic he's trying to appeal to?
