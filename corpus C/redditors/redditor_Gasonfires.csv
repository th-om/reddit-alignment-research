cvxuhjo,0,t1_cvxqrf6,Gasonfires,"Most states don't have legal doctor-assisted suicide.  But the question was about the states that do.  There are five of them.  In Montana it's the result of a state court decision that shields doctors from prosecution and in Oregon, California, Vermont and Washington it's the result of legislation.  In each of the states that allow it by legislation, the statutes specifically provide that use of the law has no effect on a patient's life insurance policy.  [See here](http://euthanasia.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000132#legal_states).  Why would anyone think a state that compassionately allows death with dignity wouldn't also make sure insurance companies can't use it to dodge their contractual obligations?",1,0,1444712429,1444729950

cvwzr7f,0,t1_cvwtknj,Gasonfires,"You are making shit up from TV that you saw.  That's your real world as far as I can tell.  The insurance assholes are in business to make money.  They realized a long time ago that one of the best ways to do that is to pay up and close the file when they clearly owe.  We're not talking about some fake neck and back claim, or even a legitimate one that they can try to weasel out of.  The question is about fucking paid up life insurance, and an insurance company could only hurt its image and waste a ton of money by resisting payment to beneficiaries on the grounds of suicide when a statute plainly says they can't do that.  The state insurance regulators would be all over a company that tried something like that and would almost certainly threaten their license to sell insurance in the state.",1,0,1444664232,1444729950
cvwh92d,0,t1_cvvrbly,Gasonfires,"Stop trying to weasel.  You answered with a flat, unqualified ""no"" to the question: ""Will life insurance pay out in a case of legal doctor-assisted suicide.""  The question therefore applies specifically only to places where physician assisted suicide is legal, and all of those states require the patient to be terminally ill.  Why would you want to ""answer in the most vague way possible?""  Did you even read the question?

Jesus.  Just admit you didn't know and answered wrongly.",1,0,1444614929,1444729950
cvwgvd6,0,t1_cvvrfrl,Gasonfires,"No one asked about anyplace in particular.  My assumption would be that any state that enacts a Death With Dignity Act like Oregon's would also include a provision that bars lfe insurance companies from dodging payment in cases where the insured uses the Act.  Believe it or not, however, many states require their citizens to just tough out those last agonizing days and will actually punish anyone who helps them die on their own terms.  Barbaric.",1,0,1444614258,1444729950
