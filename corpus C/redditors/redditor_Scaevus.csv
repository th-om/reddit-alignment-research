cvxkzyi,0,t1_cvxk7nw,Scaevus,All torpedo damage is reduced proportionately. So a 20k max torpedo always does 2x as much as a 10k max torpedo. So it's actually a perfectly good argument. ,1,0,1444696342,1444725720
cvxjpe5,0,t1_cvxj1nd,Scaevus,That's what Fox News tried to convince us in 2012. Obama crushed Romney. It wasn't even close. ,4,0,1444694267,1444725720

cvxid51,0,t1_cvxi277,Scaevus,"Since you don't listen to reason, I see no reason to keep trying to help you. It's not like I've played 1200+ games and experienced T10 in Cruisers, BBs, and CVs or anything. I'm sure you know way more. ",-1,0,1444692082,1444725720
cvxej8b,0,t1_cvxeahd,Scaevus,"You don't even understand how basic game balancing works. If CVs can get their torpedoes avoided 100% of the time, which takes 3+ minutes to reload and can be shot down, then CV would be so unfun nobody would play them. Imagine if you packed all your shells for three minutes into a single salvo. How much damage should you do? 

You can learn to play or bitch at me on the forums. Your choice, son. ",-1,0,1444685972,1444725720
cvxaiy6,0,t1_cvwx7z8,Scaevus,"Seeing as how each Shima torpedo does like 2.5x damage compared to a Midway one, you only need to eat 4.",1,0,1444680222,1444725720
cvxaf4m,0,t1_cvx35el,Scaevus,"Who said you're supposed to avoid damage from a CV that takes 3 minutes per salvo? You'd take 1 torpedo for 5k damage if you bothered teaming with a Cruiser with AA. Make it inefficient to drop on you, not impossible. CVs exist to punish poor teamplay.",0,0,1444680069,1444725720
cvx62u8,0,t1_cvwwugo,Scaevus,Wouldn't even be mad. Brady would be in half the Super Bowls for the last 14 years. That's amazing. ,6,0,1444673830,1444725720
