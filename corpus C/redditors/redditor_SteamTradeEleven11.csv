cvxv65v,0,t1_cvx86hr,SteamTradeEleven11,"Don't even try and discuss it. /r/technology is so rampantly pro-piracy there is no point.  Apparently the entire entertainment industry needs to discover a business model where everyone gets everything for free and no one has to actually work for money.  It's the worst mix of libertarian (muh freefom to pirate / ""distribute information"") with communism of everyone working towards the ""public good.""",1,0,1444714214,1444732044

cvwmhbw,0,t1_cvwmcgt,SteamTradeEleven11,"Any audit done by congress would be nothing but a political side show.  The only reason to propose an audit is if you don't trust what they are doing and intent to find some evidence to change how the Fed operates.  It's a thinly veiled attack on the independence of the Fed. The audit is supported almost exclusively within the libertarian community that wishes to abolish the Fed.  The most outspoken voice in audit the Fed was gold-standard and central bank abolishing advocate, Ron Paul.  Clearly he doesn't want to audit the Fed just to see whats going on. He just wants to interrupt the process, poison the well, and shout his message of abolishing something he clearly doesn't understand. ",3,0,1444624921,1444732044
cvwm7c3,0,t1_cvwm329,SteamTradeEleven11,"I don't want congress to ever interfere with the central bank.  The last thing our economy needs is for the bunch of know-nothing self-important lawyers and politicians in congress to stick their noses into the models, discussion and understanding of trained economists.  Congress has proved over and over again that anytime technical expertise and nuance is needed in a topic they are the last body that should get any influence.  The Fed is a huge forum of debate across the many hundreds of trained economists it employs.  I trust their judgement far more than anything to come out of the peanut gallery of congress.
