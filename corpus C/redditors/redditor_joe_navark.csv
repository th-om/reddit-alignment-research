>All those banks have “structured products approval committees”, where a team of banking staff sits down to decide whether their bank should adopt a particular new complex financial product. If economics were a social science like sociology or anthropology, practitioners would set about interviewing those committee members, scrutinising the meetings’ minutes and trying to observe as many meetings as possible.

Why would they have to do that? They can see the result of these meetings by what institutions did in the market, and then subsequently what the market did to the institutions. Since when do economists study meetings? Does he know the difference between an economist and an organizational psychologist? ",0,0,1444706917,1444719825

You'd have to assume that all five companies were in perfect collusion and never allowed the rest of the populace to use the AI.  Otherwise, there would be infinite production available with no scarcity, so basically everything would be free and the citizens would be able to quit work and make shitposts on reddit all day.

You have to assume that (1) the new AI is a perfect substitute for all human labor, (2) the robots and AI are virtually costless, so that in no case does it make economic sense to employ a human, and (3) for some reason, the proletariat is unable to take advantage of this costless AI to make things for themselves or undercut the techno-oligarchs who run this place.  None of these things are possible, so this basically turns into just another luddite fantasy.  Keep smashing them looms, dude.",2,0,1444590228,1444719825
