cvuljnf,0,t1_cvulgam,rookieoftheyeard,"Except the distribution was not normal. Here's the breakdown he posted:

As : 10 (including 5 > 100)

Bs: 4

Cs: 8

Ds: 12

Fs: 10 (including 7 < 50)

Lowest grade was a 33 so I doubt it's anyone who was planning on dropping the class and just didn't come to the exam. The greater than 100 part comes from the test actually having 110 pts, but only being scored out of a hundred, and then 4 bonus points he added in later when he saw only a few students actually checked the edge cases in one problem, and few did the most optimal solution for another.

cvul49q,0,t1_cvtwzev,rookieoftheyeard,"I recently had an exam where about half the class made below a C. The professor was fucking pissed. He told use what most of the exam would be, what quiz to study for each of the questions, and for the two questions which didn't have a quiz he put up a practice example, and strongly encouraged everyone to finish the assigned program before the exam because it would be relevant.

Honestly it's obvious most people did not study. ",1,0,1444458866,1444718956
