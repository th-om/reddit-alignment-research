gang members shouldn't be having guns period, especially if they are felons, which many of them are. not exactly the kind of people who are going to obey laws. i don't agree that disarmament of all citizens is the right direction to head, it still won't address this problem./

> This is where the statistics are so important. We know from the data that the US has a very high homicide rate (just on firearms), so it doesn't seem to reduce the homicide rate to a level comparable to nations that do restrict firearms.

but we don't measure prevented homicides either. the US does restrict  firearms, just a lot less than other nations",1,0,1444596768,1444718078
cvw3kwz,0,t1_cvw2ybg,p220,"> I think that would show up in the statistics. We would have a low homicide rate if it was a net positive.

The gun rights community wishes that were the case, especially with regards to the times when firearms are used as a deterrent and nobody gets hurt, which is the ideal use of force- the threat of force that prevents its own need for application. i.e., bad guy sees unsuspecting victim poses a danger to them, beats it and no violent crime occurs. 

This is what must be weighed when considering the taking of that ability away from law-abiding citizens. It'd be nice to have more statistics, but it's hard to get them all from 50 states uniformly - and the best instances where nobody gets hurt are most completely unrecorded.

/r/dgu really surprises me by the sheer number of small events which otherwise go mostly unnoticed.

> Firearm laws in the US are largely unenforceable. They rely on intent and have no registrations or verification. Instead, the US has much stronger punitive laws... if you commit a crime, having a firearm ensures you will get a lengthy sentence.

Yeah, but not as lengthy in practice as you might think. Chicago is a perfect example of catch-and-release law enforcement.

> Everyone agrees there should be some regulation. Nobody wants insane criminals buying firearms. The real argument is whether registration and so forth is worth the lives saved.

Or the lives lost by disarming people who honor the law. There lots of gun deaths, but that includes deaths of violent criminals who would otherwise have taken the lives of innocents.

I'm not making a judgement here, just pointing out that it goes both ways, and any policy change should take all of these statistics into account.

My state (Illinois) started letting citizens carry after a permit holding woman was beat half to death inside a church by a crazy guy, and she was following the local law and disarmed herself, and it almost killed her. She should matter just as much as innocents killed by violent criminals.
