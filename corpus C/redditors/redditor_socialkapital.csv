Prosecutors? Maybe be willing to walk away when you know you could win a case but there's a chance you'd be ruining someone who doesn't deserve it.

I'd be fine with erring on the side of innocence.",18,0,1444621730,1444728960
cvwiyt7,0,t1_cvwf1aw,socialkapital,"How do you democratize something while simultaneously making it more exclusionary? There is already a considerable stratum of the population being preyed upon by for-profit schools, precisely because the majority wouldn't make it at legitimate institutions of higher education. If the problem were that there is an underclass of brilliant, capable individuals who just can't get in, that would be different. It just isn't clear to me that this is the case. Access to student loans sucked in people who would have fit in this category.

A better solution, in my mind, would be to actually educate people at the secondary level. Teach them to read, and make them read. Make them contemplate life and society. We can't just train them to fit into the ""new economy"" by gutting the humanities, making them pass STEM-oriented tests, and then expect progress will show up of its own accord.",4,0,1444617980,1444728960

Are you on the ""not enough STEM"" bandwagon which will keep engineering wages down and lead to a populace that's good at solving narrow problems when told to, or do you think we should continue to remove the humanities from secondary schooling and then pay for everyone to learn to read critically in college?",5,0,1444595819,1444728960
