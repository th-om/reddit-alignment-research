cvv8moh,0,t1_cvv8dz9,I_See_Wrong_People,"This is literally the easiest and most delicious suggestion in the thread. I actually have a pot I made last night waiting to be reheated for the party tonight. 

Add some crunchy lardons and chopped green onion on top for a little contrast. Chill and swirl in some cream and you got vichyssoise. One of the best recipes I ever learned. 

Also you can use just water in a pinch instead of stock. But stock helps. ",3,0,1444518380,1444719249

cvv7g9v,0,t1_cvv2z03,I_See_Wrong_People,"But pro-choice advocates and activists want abortion  on demand without question. Sadly the vocal opinions are really far to the ends of the spectrum on this issue. Their shrill screeching and shady misinformation tactics (planned parenthood scandal, et al) make it impossible to have the nuanced and respectful conversation that's necessary to move on from this issue with meaningful progress.

cvv4x5p,0,t1_cvuzund,I_See_Wrong_People,"I like to refer to myself as anti-abortion but pro-choice. I think abortion is basically morally wrong, but I think history has shown that it is a product for which there is demand, and like illegal drugs, prohibition carries huge costs. 

I would like to see a pro-choice politician propose policies that would reduce the number of abortions by addressing the demand side of the equation. Reduce the costs associated with prenatal care, strong social supports for mothers that do not want the child, financial incentives from adoptive parents, free healthcare for infants, and most importantly comprehensive sex Ed and free, effective birth control. If you don't support those things you are not serious about reducing or eliminating abortion and don't deserve a place at the discussion table. ",1,0,1444511437,1444719249
