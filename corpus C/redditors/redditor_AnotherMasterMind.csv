cvx54s2,1,t3_3oh49y,AnotherMasterMind,"The contemporary left doesn't see a problem with bias, they think bias is inevitable so they want to be biased in a way that is most effective.  This is why oldschool journalists don't like people like greenwald, because he thinks objectivity is a myth.  

People like Chomsky have been very influential in this sense.  He thinks people who criticize other societies are bigots and people who criticize their own society to be wise.  
I think this is a mistake.  There is a spectrum from bias to objectivity.  Some liberals have a very binary sense of the world.  You're either helping the U.S. commit crimes or you're nobly resisting it's oppression.  

But nuance is not merely a tool of manipulation  to perpetuate the power of elites.  

I think the real issue is that today's journalists feel like they have to talk down to their readers.  Most people are kind of stupid and so there is a sense that seeking truth will just play into their sense of tribalism anyway.  So if journalism equals manipulation, we might as well direct our criticism back toward the power structure we can have the most influence on.  

Journalists who buy into this narrative, that they can never really be anything more than activists, should be read as such and nothing more.  In my opinion it's a historical effect of Marxism, the idea that we are all just on a team and not individuals first.  ",7,0,1444672464,1444726436
cvv6pmy,1,t3_3o8f68,AnotherMasterMind,">It’s a bit difficult to respond to his views because he holds different ones simultaneously

I think he means mutually exclusive views.

>In one instance, he explicitly says “We should profile Muslims, or anyone who looks like he or she could conceivably be Muslim, and we should be honest about it.” Anyone with an elementary understanding of the English language understands this as an unequivocal call for religious profiling targeting a specific religious community. In another instance, however, Harris suggests another kind of profiling: “Anti-profiling,” which simply excludes people “who obviously pose no threat,” or people whom “at a glance, you can rule out as non-Jihadists.” Which of these two different proposals does Harris actually advocate? For someone who frequently accuses his critics of misrepresenting his views, it surely seems convenient to hold multiple positions.

That's not multiple positions.  It's one position expressed using more than one sentence.  And they are both in the first post, yet the author makes it sound like Sam switched his position or something.  

The whole point of the rise in airport security is the fear of suicidal attacks on the plane.  And there is a strong connection between this and extremist jihad.  The author doesn't seem to deal with this fact at all, other than to conveniently ignore the factor of airports.

Saying that that it is stupid to pretend everyone poses an equal threat, and that many people stand no chance of being  a jihadist, so we ought to be honest and stop wasting our resources on them, and instead profile people who at least stand some chance of being a jihadist, are not incompatible claims.   

>if Muslim extremists really did statistically pose a greater threat, would that actually justify targeting Muslims with more security measures? Consider this before you answer: Given the mass-shootings by White people in Columbine, Sandy Hook, Aurora, Charleston, Oak Creek, Seal Beach and now in Oregon, would anyone support searching White people as they go into crowded venues? Considering the vastly more enormous toll gun violence takes on Americans than terrorism, you’d think this would be a more important area to profile if profiling made any sense. Or take this more statistically precise example: According to FBI statistics over the past few years, African Americans are responsible for the majority of robberies in the US. But would anyone in their right mind support a policy where Black people are singled out for scrutiny when entering retail stores? The answer is so obvious as to go without saying, but I’ll say it anyway: No, because we as a society understand that complex societal factors influence crime demographics, and we refuse to stigmatize an entire group when we know the overwhelming majority of them are decent people just like the rest of us.

But the whole point behind profiling potential extremist jihadists in airports is that they adhere to an ideology that encourages suicidal murder and planes being hijacked or bombed has global consequences.  The analogy to blacks is also incorrect.  It's more accurately that security guards should be well trained enough to understand that if anyone is going to rob a store, it's not gonna be the little girl in the wheel chair.  What we're looking for is anyone who could conceivably be a criminal and that is in no way reducible to race.",7,0,1444514806,1444726436
cvrip3j,1,t3_3nu89h,AnotherMasterMind,"Sounds like the author is jealous that they are getting attention and has no real counter-argument other than to say that they don't deserve as much praise as some are giving them.

>“The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance—it is the illusion of knowledge.” In this case, it’s not quite the obstacle to discovery, but it is the obstacle to real, significant progress. Because what Harris and Nawaz brought to the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum last Monday was exactly that: an illusion of knowledge. An illusion that their dialogue was a groundbreaking first, which pushed the words of hundreds of thousands of actual Muslim scholars under the rug. An illusion that their positions actually benefit Muslim communities and that they as such could speak for them, which is not corroborated by their reputations among and reception by these very communities. But most of all, Harris and Nawaz brought an illusion that Islam is inherently problematic and requires Western-style religious reform to truly be palatable, an assumption which ignores any and all religious, historical, or sociopolitical context.

This in incorrect.  This was a dialogue of their ideas, not a claim to own the topic or do a historical analysis of Muslim opposition to the problems of Islam.

cvmliks,1,t3_3n0tzc,AnotherMasterMind,"I think Sam's strategy of responding is slightly flawed.  He ought to divide it into 2 sections.  First, Provide a compassionate and neutral response with no passive aggressive language and half-insults.  This is the most powerful way to communicate, by genuinely imagining the person you are responding to is your best friend.  

Then second, have an addendum explaining personal experience and response to the collision.  Frustration can corrupt a message when woven into its structure.  People like Obeidallah wont change their mind, but his audience may be open to seeing Sam's point of view, and we ought to make ourselves the examples of being welcoming and forgiving conversationalists, even with proven liars.  Because the alternative means giving up on conversation.

And for the most part, I think Sam has stayed true to that mission, but here and there, one can witness mild venom in his words that I think make it easier for people inclined to see him as a villain to confirm their suspicions.",1,0,1443861610,1444726436
