This wasn't about Sanders or the Democratic primary--if someone as reviled as Trump is nominated, the only Democrat who could lose would be Martha Coakley.",3,0,1444624059,1444720604

cvwg0ms,0,t1_cvvvns5,Debageldond,"What's amazing to me is just how incredibly disorganized and completely useless the Republicans have been. Since they no longer have a Democratic Senate to blame, House Republicans have been exposed as being not only incapable of governing the country, but using their own caucus' power as well.

I really thought this would be a very contentious term, full of filibusters and vetoes, kind of like the 110th. Instead, things rarely even get that far. Republicans began the term by focusing on petty wedge issues, and Obama's only had to issue two vetoes, the last being in March. Something always happens to screw up House votes, one way or the other.

This isn't to say that I wanted them to be able to push their agenda, but with the kind of majorities they have, we should at least be seeing more filibusters. While I always am careful not to read too much from last fall's results, they came out of that election looking powerful. Not even a year later, they look like a complete mess, and are so very far from other oppositional Congresses like Gingrich's during most of the Clinton years, or even Pelosi's during Bush's last couple years. They look powerless against the very forces they boosted and co-opted in order to win in 2010.",29,0,1444612769,1444720604

cvvwzjb,0,t1_cvvwsa7,Debageldond,"I don't doubt that there are plenty of nice, culturally progressive places in the south, and I'm certainly not saying that everyone in the south is racist or accepting of that culture. It's just that statistically speaking, while you'll run into racism everywhere (and have majorities nearly everywhere made of those who are not explicitly racist), you're more likely to run into explicit racism in certain regions of the country rather than others.

I'm glad you had a good time there though!",6,0,1444581297,1444720604
