cvx5buc,0,t1_cvx45zx,LonelyNixon,Nope season 3. Also the clay face episode was the finale,5,0,1444672745,1444731084
cvwz2jv,0,t1_cvwv9gl,LonelyNixon,"A lot of the hate comes from the fact that the dcau was still around while this was airing and it effectively killed any delusions of another batman tas reboot. Even more of it is from the fact that wb created that nonsensical bat embargo that blocked batman villains like the joker from appearing in jlu. 

The biggest thing though is that the show does start off really weak.  The season one is not really good. The animation is fantastic it's crazy how fluid it all is but the stories were pretty weak except for an episode here and there and then the finale happened and it got pretty solid.  Season 2 was decent but not amazing. Season 3 introduced batgirl and wasn't quite on point as 2 was but still decent. Then they introduced Robin in season 4 and everything just came together. By season 5 it was genuinely very good. 


Another issue is a lot of people had problems with the more 2d almost campy interpretations of the character and villains and the fact that everyone fought like crouching tiger hidden dragon. ",16,0,1444663094,1444731084

cvtr3d8,0,t1_cvtqw7m,LonelyNixon,Sorry no I cannot. I can't remember what episode it was in either. I just remember someone listing dark lords and revan is among them ,1,0,1444403447,1444731084
cvtq1yp,0,t1_cvtkx72,LonelyNixon,"Although technically not cannon the old Republic stuff isn't contradicted and some of it is even referenced in the clone wars cartoon which is. 

Little things like trips to nar shadaa,  going to koriban and seeing a force ghost of Darth bane and there was a passing reference to Darth revan as well. ",1,0,1444401839,1444731084
