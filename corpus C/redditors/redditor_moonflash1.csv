I do not think that is every going to happen. Hindustani culture (of which Pakistan is also a part of) has been proliferated throughout the world through new age spirituality, yoga, buddhism, bollywood and chicken Tandoori. Don't think Pakistan specifically has anything else to offer. ",2,0,1444693597,1444731516

Think of Iran in the 50s and 60s and Iran now. Me personally, I would not engage in condemning Iranians because they are a victim of oppression. I would certainly condemn their government though, which I think is fair game for implementing the hard line policies that they has which btw have nothing to do with ""culture"".

>Dawkins then took over saying: ""But that's 'their culture' and you have to accept it. It's the one exception. Liberal about everything but this one exception, 'it's their culture'. 

>""Well, to hell with their culture.""

Kind of a ridiculous quote really, or maybe the headline is inaccurate? Because Dawkins isn't blasting ""Muslims"" here, or ""Muslim culture"" if such a thing can be defined at all. Islam, as practiced by over 1.5 billion people in 50 countries is extremely diverse and is no way a monolith. So who is this arbitrary ""their"" in Dawkin's quote? Saudi Arabia? Iran? Or is he condenming the average Muslim just for belonging to the religion of Islam? Extremely confusing to say the least.

And anyway, only an extremely tiny majority of women voluntarily wear ""a bee keeper's suit"", many of them are forced to do so by oppressive governments. Why not condemn these governments instead of the condemning and demonizing the people?",-13,0,1444606674,1444731516

cvvvm27,0,t1_cvvv54h,moonflash1,"Interesting proposition, I would have to watch this documentary to make a conclusion about it but as far as I know, criminology is far more complex than just prevailing cultural norms and socioeconomics play an extremely important role here too. The United States for instance is also part of the West but they have an extremely high rate of homocide per capita than any other country in the first world. And rioting and civil disobedience, such as those that happened in Stockholm and London which could be assumed to be dominated by immigrant youth happen in [Poland](http://www.dw.com/en/nationalist-riots-at-poland-independence-day-celebrations-in-warsaw/a-18057250) and [Germany](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/26/football-fans-neo-nazis-riot-cologne) as well, dominated by natives. So I would suggest that Europe's relatively low crime rate is not because of Western culture but because of economic prosperity and abundance of social services for the poor. Even if you look at non-western countries like Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and UAE who are economically extremely well off, we see the same pattern of low crime and homicide rate. So I would argue it's not cultural and has more to do with economics.",3,0,1444578765,1444731516
