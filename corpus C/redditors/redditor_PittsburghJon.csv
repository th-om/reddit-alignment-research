cvx61d1,1,t3_3og8b8,PittsburghJon,"An airplane that flies from LaGuardia to JFK Airport

The sketch starts with the airplane taking off, and ends with it landing.  The two airports are so close the flight would only be like 4 minutes.  So the flight attendants are running around to get through all the take off safety information; they're reading it really fast and skipping important parts.  Then they do a drink service, but there is so little time they just start throwing the drinks at the passengers.  Then they give out hot towels, and again just start throwing them at passengers and people get burnt.

Tracey and Leslie are husband and wife passengers, it keeps cutting to them and they're fighting about how they should have just taken a taxi.

As the sketch goes on the flight attendants just run around faster and faster to get ready for landing.  Screaming at the top of their lungs at people who have their tray tables up.",11,0,1444673771,1444729645
