The only thing we disagree about is the above sentence.  I'm saying that in all likelihood, they did not fully understand the risks to themselves or others in the heat of the moment. It's unfortunate that you grew up with such a strong sense of responsibility that you can't visualize that others aren't quite so strong in this area. It seems that in your mind, they knew it was wrong, and consciously agreed that their fun was much more important than any stranger's lives they put in danger, and proceeded with their actions. That's why you don't do shit like this, because you rationally think these things out before proceeding. However, many others don't think this way.

Personally, I'm for weaker sentences for people who do stuff out of stupidity than those who do it intentionally. If you text and drive and kill a kid, I put it in a different category than intentionally killing a kid. Stupid is a lot easier to rehabilitate than psychopathy.

Again, my beef is with your above statement. Had they not crashed, and were sober a few days later, and discussed what they did in a serious, rational, reflective manner, then yes, they probably would have recognized that they put people at harm. However, when fueled with adrenaline (and drugs or whatever) in the heat of the moment, you don't recognize those dangers. Ask any teen-pregnant person about thinking rationally in the heat of the moment.

I still have a hard time visualizing all of the potential consequences to each of my actions. I don't think my brain could handle all of the permutations, nor do I wish to imagine the suffering that I could cause for just waking up and driving to work each day. Did I get enough sleep? Are my tires fully pressurized? Did I check the weather forecast? Am I adjusted to my new meds yet?

Sometime you have to say fuck-it and just do stuff, otherwise you'd sit in the dark at home all day.
