cvxe9kf,1,t3_3ogetr,sweetwattah,"Starters gone for the season/forever:

Myles Jack-2nd team all conference selection lost to something in his knee, also declared for the draft too :(. LB/CB/WR/RB

Eddie Vanderdoes-starting DT, lost to ACL tear in home opener

Fabian Moreau-CB. Foot is fucked

Mossi Johnson-WR/DB ACL, MCL, PCL torn in practice.

Starters injured:

Marcus Rios-CB sinuses, unknown status

Jayon Brown-LB that filled in for Jack, back. Unknown status

While our injuries in number don't measure up to some schools here. Everyone that's hurt, except for Brown, were pillars to our game play. Johnson not as much I guess, but he was a pretty prominent target before moving to help on defense to offset Moreau's injury. If Jack and Vanderdoes were healthy especially, I would have no doubt that we would tangle with Utah for the South.
