The consequences of their[drug addicts] actions can have a societal impact. Therefore it is a societal problem and should be dealt with accordingly.

Your opinion on how to deal with this?
> Being addicted to something is not a crime. I never said addicts should be arrested and incarcerated.

No, they shouldn't be arrested, you'd just rather they die in some back alley street or a crack house.

>I say we let the herd thin itself out

That's an unacceptable stance, one that is willfully ignorant of the problems addicts, and and we as a society, face regarding drug abuse.",1,0,1444491259,1444718306
cvuppo0,0,t1_cvu6ru7,j3utton,"I'm assuming that comment is in response to my 'if we don't have wars then we don't have war torn vets'.  You're essentially saying it's not the vets fault we went to war, it's the politicians, so the vet's PTSD is out of their control, and we as a society should cover it's expense.  You're own logic still contradicts that.  No one forced these guys to enlist in the army, they enlisted on their own.  They made a personal choice to join the army and they should have to live with the associated risks and consequences... Right? Isn't it that simple?

No, it isn't that simple.

Whether it's someone addicted to crack, or a returning Vet with PTSD, if they have a problem we as a society should be willing to help them with that problem because it's often cheaper and better for society as a whole in the long run.  Someone strung out on heroine, slipping through the cracks and 'thinning the herd' is NOT a safe individual to have wondering the street.  Their behavior can be erratic and/or dangerous.  We have two choices to mitigate this problem.  We can lock them up where they aren't a danger to others, or we can treat the actual problem and help them manage their addiction.  The latter option has the benefit of usually being cheaper than incarceration (you're the one that brought up cost of rehab) and it betters society in the long run.  What don't you get about this?  It's win win for everyone.  Rehab is cheaper, it's safer and a more long term solution as there's less recidivism, and we don't give up any rights or liberties to acquire those benefits.

Stop giving me this bullshit about personal choices and ""living with the consequences"".  We live in a society so we can mitigate those risk and consequences.  If you don't like that then feel free to go leave society.  There are still a few uninhabited islands dotting the oceans around the world.  You're free to go live there and enjoy all of the associated risks and consequences you want.",1,0,1444479945,1444718306

Will the child be better off emotionally and psychologically in the long run if they are ripped out of the life they know now and put into one that they are unfamiliar with?  Will the drama of such a change have any lasting impact on them? I don't know have an answer to that, but it MUST be considered when figuring out the best course of action.

> I can't understand how the hell a kid can be adopted out when the parents have yet to have a fair hearing/trial with a resolution.

I have no idea either.  This whole situation is ridiculous and never should have happened.

cvtm8oi,0,t1_cvtkteb,j3utton,"An argument can be made that the bio parents are being selfish as well. Yes, the past events have been tragic and never should have happened. But they did. What's happened can't be changed.

Provided the adoptive parents are good parents, provide a loving and well-adjusted home. That they have the means to provide a good life to the child. Then it may not be in the best interests of the child to remove it from that environment.  The child has certainly already established strong emotional and psychological bonds to the adoptive parents.  They are comfortable and secure in their current environment.  Upending that and removing the child at this point would probably not be beneficial to the child and may in fact be detrimental.  Infant and early childhood psychology is a tricky thing.

Most of us are thinking emotionally here, as well we should.  The moral and ethical ramifications of what these parents have gone through certainly needs to be considered.  But if rational thinking does need to prevail (and it should), we need to rationally consider what might the net psychological effect be on the child as well.

I do not know what the correct course of action is here.  I'm merely provided another side of the argument.",-1,0,1444394598,1444718306

At this age the child has already made strong emotional and psychological connections to the adoptive parents.

Edit: To clarify, I'm not saying I support this position.  I don't know what correct course of action is.  I'm merely pointing out another side of the argument.  The adoptive parents are almost certainly not 'monsters' and to degrade the conversation to that is childish and helps no one.  The conversation here is more nuanced then we are currently making it.  People are thinking with emotion rather than logic or reason.  All points should be considered, especially what's in the best interests of the child.  Again, I do not know what is in the best interests of the child, just stating a rational argument can be made for leaving the child where it currently is.",-2,0,1444393685,1444718306

That's not how a civilized society functions.

Wouldn't it be interesting if we had the resources necessary where it was possible for us to help all of those people you mentioned, the sick, the war torn vets, and those addicted to narcotics.  Oh wait.  We do.

> save our money for the folks who have unavoidable struggles. We've got war-torn vets that need lots of expensive longterm care.

You contradict yourself here.  Having war torn vets is certainly an avoidable problem.  Maybe if we didn't spend trillions of dollars on needless and unnecessary wars that only served to further destabilize a region of the world, then we wouldn't have any war torn vets.
