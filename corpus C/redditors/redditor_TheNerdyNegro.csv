cvxoowv,0,t1_cvxnaby,TheNerdyNegro,"I'm just as surprised as you are. Regardless of what you think the details are. Nothing like this should have ever rocketed through our political process. This not only affects our nation but every other super power. It also gives power to corporations over sovereign governments. It extends drug patents so pharmaceutical companies can deny patients generic affordable drugs.

You can call me ignorant all you want. But no one wants a system so closed that it's illegal to investigate your own software or hardware. 

>But hey, you got to be a smug prick about something you know nothing about, so the night's not a total loss.

No need for ad hominem attacks. If this applies to a company or manufacture. How does that affect us any differently if it were individuals. The manufacture is not allowed to investigate their own product? Retail stores are not allowed to investigate their own product? No one is allowed to investigate their closed source software in any way?

Can you tell me why the TPP is good for all nations of the world? Or why no one needs to worry? I've looked at your comment history. We surprisingly agree on many things. I presumed your intent but I think the only issue is that you go all balls out in every single comment. I think sometimes a little more subtly might do you good. Even your sensible comments are downvoted because of the way you presented your argument and not so much the substance of it. I believe if you start off calling people names people automatically dismiss what you are saying and feel they are being attacked for no reason.

I actually am curious what your stance is based on the knowledge you have.

You know. We can have a logical thought provoking discussion right?
