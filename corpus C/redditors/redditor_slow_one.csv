That being said, I *do* agree that parents should be teaching sex ed and safe sex to their kids.  Unfortunately, it seems that many, many **parents just don't talk to their kids about sex.**",2,0,1444576653,1444726704
cvvjp3q,0,t1_cvvcfnk,slow_one,"Well, take a look at Louisiana then.  
Zero science based sex ed in school. Teen pregnancy rate through the roof.  There are enough people to have forced an entire state to change its policy about the subject.   
Texas is the same.  
As are other states.  ",2,0,1444539774,1444726704

The problem I have is I also see a *lot* of folks that are *not* in support of these things... and instead seem more interested in forcing a moral stance about *sex outside of marriage* versus a moral stance about abortion.  (Note: I realize that there are plenty of women who are married that seek abortions. I'm commenting more on the seeming morally righteous attitude many anti-abortion protesters take in regards to the subject... forgetting that women have a right to make decisions for their own health)",1,0,1444511215,1444726704
