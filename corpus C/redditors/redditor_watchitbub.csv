cvxr0lj,0,t1_cvxqrro,watchitbub,Weekday is very important. You want those little douchebag kids in school and not in the theater! Either the earliest showing or the latest on a weekday is best to avoid them.,1,0,1444705705,1444719411
cvxqnmk,0,t1_cvxqd1h,watchitbub,"Sure. Or I could go to almost any other theater in town at 11am on a weekday and have a superior experience. Hell, even Galaxy Highland 10 is better at 11 am if you are there for the film. Most other theaters have better seating and bigger screens than the Alamo and no waiters or food service to distract. Alamo's gimmick doesn't help make the experience of viewing the film better. Better pre-show, but that's about it. ",1,0,1444705120,1444719411
cvxq2mg,0,t1_cvxm310,watchitbub,"I'm there to see the movie. That's the point of the whole thread - the theater experience is unpleasant for many people, and overpriced food and beer isn't going to improve the experience *of seeing the film*. You could go to a restaurant for better (and cheaper) food, a bar for better beer selection. Where else are people who want to see the film supposed to go? Film purists like Nolan or Tarantino keep campaigning to make an ideal environment to see the film - that's what they really care about in the theater - not eat and drink.

Sure, some people like the food service at the Drafthouse. Some people like to go to the theater to make snide remarks for the amusement of their friends. Some people want to multi-task and play with their phones while they sort of watch the film. If that creates a distraction from the film (again, the whole point of being there for most people), then that's a diminished experience for anyone there for the film. That doesn't make that audience member a misanthrope or ""reactionary idiot"" to get annoyed at behavior of people in the theater who obviously don't give a fuck as long as they have other things like loud banter, phones, shitty food, or a pitcher of beer to amuse them. But others really want to get lost in the film, and noise (however it is caused) or movement that pulls the eye away from the screen (like the waiters moving about or people playing with their phones) detracts from that.

And it's not just the /r/Austin folks who don't like it. The comments on the Drafthouse's own website were uniformly terrible regarding the food. I wish I could link to that, but the Drafthouse has deleted that page.",1,0,1444704172,1444719411
cvx8tl1,0,t1_cvx8ha0,watchitbub,"I've been going to the Drafthouse since the first location opened. Post in /r/Austin sometime about how great the Drafthouse is and there will be no shortage of people telling you about how badly the food has declined (while the prices only went up up up) since they went corporate. Now it's a rip-off and whatever novelty the concept had has worn off for anyone who isn't new to the Drafthouse and doesn't know the difference. 

The Drafthouse constantly patting themselves on the back for their cell phone policy is really hypocritical considering how much they are willing to overlook the other distractions involved with pawning off shitty reheated Sysco crap at premium prices. ",5,0,1444677787,1444719411
cvx7m0x,0,t1_cvx5tgk,watchitbub,"The Alamo Drafthouse has it's own problems that are arguably more distracting than a cell phone. 

Specifically - the food service. People talking about what they want to order, trying to fill out the order slip in the dark, asking the waiter questions, the clinking of silverware and the rustling of basket liners, waiters darting about asking if you want anything else and delivering the bill (without fail, they will do this in the one important scene in the film where understanding the exposition is crucial to comprehending the third act of the film), people discussing how to settle up the bill, waiters processing the transaction, picking up plates, ect. 

As much as they like to tout their commitment to a distraction-free environment, all you have to do if you really want to gab away undisturbed is to hold a menu in your hand. If they think for a second that you are about to spend *way, way* too much money for substandard Chili's-level food, then they won't make you stop your conversation. 

Frankly the cell phones aren't that bad in comparison. ",14,0,1444676037,1444719411
cvwms5l,1,t3_3oega7,watchitbub,"I read this novel before heading to Japan for a job teaching English. No joke, I had a student on my rolls named May Kasahara who was scheduled every week but never showed up. 

I always imagined she was off at some wig factory somewhere.",5,0,1444625644,1444719411
cvvro25,0,t1_cvvj9in,watchitbub,"It's not so terrible when the companies that hold the rights subsequently release a respectable version. Films like Silence of the Lambs,  This is Spinal Tap, and Robocop are out of print on Criterion, but the later studio versions are not bad at all. 

It's really sad when it's a case like Sid and Nancy which only got a bare bones release from the studio after the rights on the Criterion version lapsed. A title like that would sell far better as an updated Criterion than it ever will in the studio version (for an early release, the extras on this one are fantastic and an update could only improve on that), and yet there is no indication that the rights will ever come back.

cvuqt0g,0,t1_cvuoz6e,watchitbub,OK - I'll check it out. Thanks!,2,0,1444483534,1444719411
cvuoerv,0,t1_cvuhw60,watchitbub,"I guess I was only reticent about Epub because my limited research online suggested that conversions of PDFs to epub can be problematic when there are a lot of graphics (each chapter features an illustration and one chapter is entirely illustrations). Plus I got real fussy in editing and want to preserve the layout of the text flow and the character of the typeface since that plays a part in the overall character of the story. 

Do you have any experience with converting PDF to epub? I'm old school and read everything with books, so I'm not very knowledgeable about about e-readers and reading on phones/tablets. Distributing the PDF was preferable only because I know exactly how it looks in that format and would require no other conversion. ",2,0,1444474363,1444719411
