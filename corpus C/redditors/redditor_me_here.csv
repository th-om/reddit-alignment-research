ct2nc8l,1,t3_3d6i80,me_here,"I am a registered Democrat. I volunteer on Democratic campaigns on the state and local level. I've never voted for anyone other than a Democrat.

Sanders winning the nomination would be an absolute disaster for the Democratic Party. 

Sanders has no chance, and that is a very good thing. Sanders is the Michelle Bachmann of the Democratic nomination race, someone who is so extreme that's it's almost comical. 

You've said in other replies that you would be ""shocked"" if he lost the general election. I'm sorry, you're absolutely delusional. A Bush/Rubio v Sanders election would be an absolute bloodbath. Many times worse than Reagan v Mondale. 

Voting for Sanders in the primary would be extremely detrimental to liberal causes, for no other reason than the Supreme Court. We've seen in recent months how influential the Court can be. A Republican in office for 8 years would likely give conservatives an insurmountable advantage on the Court, which will have long-term consequences. 

Nominating Bernie Sanders would be a terrible, terrible mistake. ",-1,0,1436853643,1444720369
