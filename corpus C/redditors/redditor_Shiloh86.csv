>Should a business, based on religious beliefs, be able to deny service to a customer?

I'm going to go with yes. I have very mixed feelings about it, because I hate discrimination, but I think business owners should be allowed to decide who they sell to. Unless discrimination would be very widespread and common without laws preventing it, I'm generally anti-these types of laws.

>Should the government require health insurance companies to provide free birth control?

No. IIRC, health insurance companies don't ever make exorbitant profits with high mark-ups, and I don't see why a mandate of this kind is necessary.

>Should the federal government continue to give tax credits and subsidies to the wind power industry?

No. The environment is important, but subsidies of clean energy are the worst way to protect it.

>Should employers be required to pay men and women, who perform the same work, the same salary?

No, I don't really think so. There are lots of factors that go into salary, I'm pretty sure.

>Should the government make cuts to public spending in order to reduce the national debt?

Yes, and raise certain taxes (and lower others, and create some new ones).

>Should Wall Street executives be criminally charged for their roles in the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis?

Well did they break the law?

>Do you believe labor unions help or hurt the economy?

They help sometimes, but public sector unions are pretty bad. I'd be less opposed to them if they didn't run ""think of the children""-type ads all the time for really dumb selfish causes, and I'd also be less opposed to them if they couldn't finance political campaigns.

>Should the government increase the tax rate on profits earned from the sale of stocks, bonds, and real estate?

No this woud take away my gud liquidity (thank mr bernanke)

>Should pension plans for federal, state and local government workers be transitioned into private plans?

If it would save money and not do more harm than good, yes.

>Would you favor an increased sales tax in order to reduce property taxes?

Maybe? I'd need to learn more about the property and sales taxes.

>Should internet service providers be allowed to prioritize traffic for websites that pay higher rates than their competitors?

>Do you support affirmative action programs?

Not really, the Economist had a really good article that implied lots of criticism of affirmative action.

>Should the government decrease military spending?

No, we need to have a strong military, the defense budget should stay where it is.

>Would you support increasing taxes on the rich in order to reduce interest rates for student loans? 

No, I would support increasing taxes on the rich, but I want the US to transition to equity-based financing of higher education.

>Should illegal immigrants be given access to government-subsidized healthcare?

No, giving non-US citizens too much aid could lead to serious problems- I like immigration, though.

>Should illegal immigrants be offered in-state tuition rates at public colleges within their residing state?

Only the children of illegal immigrants.

>Should the government fund space travel?

Yeah.",1,0,1444696921,1444716985
