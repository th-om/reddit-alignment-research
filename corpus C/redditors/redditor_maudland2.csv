cvqwa8p,0,t1_cvq8xz1,maudland2,"It's a theoretical scenario to explain the correlation between gun control and gun violence, which many gun owners deny. If ownership was illegal, less people would carry them. You might keep yours at home, but you'd think twice about carrying it and being prosecuted if caught.

That is, if you're a normal person with a job. Criminals won't care, of course. Hence the monetary incentive - offer a couple grand per returned handgun and I'm certain many would opt for the quick cash. Pay it out of the USD600 billion defense budget.",1,0,1444187349,1444716823
cvpvrih,1,t3_3nn22i,maudland2,"I'm so tired of the argument that gun control doesn't work. I like guns too, and I'm carrying, but I can't take anyone seriously who repeats this same old mantra. Gun control works all around the world, in every developed country. Of course, enforcement needs time. 

I would bet a year's salary that if gun ownership was completely illegal in the U.S., combined with monetary incentives for handing over guns, we'd see a massive decline in gun deaths within the next 10-20 years.

We want to protect our constitutional rights, and that's great. But it comes at a cost, and we should acknowledge that.",-2,0,1444117411,1444716823

Regarding a possible defense, blade your body, simultaneously monkey grip the knife arm and hold it against your chest, knee to the groin, turn for an arm bar, then wrist break/disarm. Both your hands control the knife arm at all times. We've trained this extensively at our gym (instructor loves knife disarms), but it's a fairly complicated technique with a high chance for fuck-ups.
