I googled it, and he's on record saying that ""Intelligent Design"" should be taught along with evolution in the classroom, but I don't see any kind of statement that he personally believes the earth is less than 10,000 years old.",6,0,1443043778,1444724916
cu7parp,1,t3_3hijq2,grammanarchy,"I question the assumption that government is any less effective or more corrupt than it's ever been.  American history is rife with scandal.  The Grant administration, for instance, was famously corrupt.  A hundred years ago, local politics on every level were dominated by political machines who ruthlessly pursued their own (mostly financial) ends.  More recently, the whole country was transfixed for a year and a half by the crimes of Richard Nixon, who barely escaped criminal prosecution.  I dislike the current crop of politicians as much as the next guy, but they're the rule rather than the exception.",3,0,1439944313,1444724916

When he ran for governor, one of the Columbus alternative papers ran a long article full of testimonials from people he'd been a jerk to -- waiters and whatnot.  Politically, he's pretty fluid -- he was much more conservative in his first term, but has moved to the center since.  When he went against his party to expand Medicaid in Ohio, a lot of people thought he was laying the groundwork for a run at the White House.",8,0,1438537978,1444724916
