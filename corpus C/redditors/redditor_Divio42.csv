cvxfj4h,0,t1_cvwx7e2,Divio42,"I had a friend who did that during and shortly after high school.

It was all little stupid things that no one cared about, everyone know he was lying about, and no one cared to call him out on his shit.

The final straw came after a really close friend of mine's funeral. We were all at a restaurant afterwards and out of nowhere he commented that one day he had chugged a bottle of vodka and had sex with the girl we had just buried. 

Without even getting into the lies that was just a fucked up thing to randomly bring up. But I knew he was lying. This kid was a dumbass who couldn't hold his alcohol without puking everywhere. That and the girl would have told me because we were just that close. 

Somehow I managed to avoid flipping out on him at that moment because of where we were. Haven't spoken to him since.",1,0,1444687527,1444719078
cvxcjuu,0,t1_cvxcc1p,Divio42,"nice. I am so going to have to reread the book soon and pull out any info I can. It'd be so cool to be able to pull up any stations location and have something that tells us lore about the stations.Brief descriptions, how they play into the Metro, maybe even screenshots from games or real life. 

High hopes that would probably never happen from there would be to use all that congregated info in the new Fallout 4 editor to completely recreate the Metro as an open world game.",2,0,1444683073,1444719078

It's very quick and easy. Scales to my level 44. You are guaranteed at least the end boss at the end of the hive but you often encounter at least one more during the run and I have, once, encountered up to 5 total including the end one.",1,0,1444602589,1444719078

Among other reasons you are not one just for this fact alone.

If someone wakes me up frantically asking questions they should not expect me to take any serious consideration into anything they are not directly telling me and I don't consider myself an asshole for that. ",11,0,1444602263,1444719078
