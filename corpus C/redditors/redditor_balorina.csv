Wives and families have, usually, been off limits from attack and insinuation.  You rarely hear anything about Chelsea, for example.  Do you even know the names of any of the wives of anyone that is running without googling them?

What changes that, usually, is when you bring them into the spotlight.  Kerry, for instance, brought his wife campaigning for him and stumping for him, which made her (and her money) fair game.

So any story about wives generally are frowned upon.  [NY Times decided to do a piece on Melania Trump](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/01/fashion/melania-trump-the-silent-partner.html) and if you look at the corrections it was a debacle.  

This is why there is very little coverage of spouses, what they do, what they're doing, or who they even are unless they are already poltiical (ie Bill Clinton).",1,1,1444715464,1444716494

[The idea was instituted in Baker vs Carr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_v._Carr) where the court laid out the framework for what was judicial and what was political.  The ruling being that the court had no say in political issues, only judicial.  

This has presented itself in many cases through the years, from many cases in the 60's where racial gerrymandering was reversed, to the TX gerrymander where the court ruled redistricting can be done at any time, to [the most recent decision](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/29/418521823/supreme-court-backs-arizonas-redistricting-commission-targeting-gridlock) that people can circumvent the legislature in creating independent election committees.",1,1,1444710802,1444716494

The Supreme Court generally doesn't hear cases that it has already ruled on unless there are extenuating circumstances.. ie it doesn't hear gerrymandering cases unless they are 14th amendment violations (equal protection).,1,1,1444709613,1444716494
