cvvkzpc,1,t3_3oar0t,jew_yorker,"Honestly, there are two decent reasons.

1: Sanders isn't focused on foreign policy. It's not as if Sanders is focusing on international issues and ignoring this one. If anything, there are a ton of issues more important to America than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It's silly to accuse him of ignoring this issue if he also doesn't spend much time talking about Syria or Ukraine or Afghanistan. 

2: Sanders is not in agreement with many of his supporters and expressing his real opinion (which we saw a glimpse of in his 2014 town hall) would alienate a decent number of them. Sanders is probably more pro-Israel than President Obama, at least in terms of each of their personal views. Bernie's views seem fairly clear to me, he thinks that Israel generally acts in self-defense but sometimes does so excessively. He supports the two-state solution and thinks that Netanyahu has been detrimental to the peace process. His viewpoint is far closer to Hillary Clinton's than it is to Zaid Jilani's.",0,0,1444543257,1444718096

For instance, I would greatly reduce the role that colleges have in investigating sexual assaults. Title IX does the opposite. It seems like colleges are ill-equipped to act as law enforcement bodies. They either try to cover up the crime to protect their own reputation or go the other way and kick an alleged assailant out in a process unfair to the accused.",3,0,1444406368,1444718096

There's some antisemitism on the anti-Zionist left, but that constituency is on the fringes in the United States. I think that in Europe, where the anti-Zionist movement is a larger player on the left and where old European stereotypes about Jews exist on the far-right, then it's a different story.  

There is far too much Islamaphobia in U.S. politics. I'm not someone who is overzealous on calling people bigots, but when someone like Ben Carson makes bigoted statements about Muslims, it's embarrassing that it doesn't hurt him in the polls. A huge percentage of Republicans want to make Islam illegal. Sure, it's probably mostly due to ignorance, but that's not exactly a good excuse.",5,0,1444261768,1444718096

Can you source this? This couldn't be further from the truth.

**[Two days ago:](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/british-prime-minister-david-cameron-on-isis-syria-assad-european-refugee-crisis/)** British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Tuesday that to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the war-torn country, President Bashar al-Assad must go.

""Assad is one of the recruiting sergeants for ISIL because of what he's done to his people. That is one of the reasons why people are flocking to ISIL, to fight for ISIL,"" Cameron said Tuesday on ""CBS This Morning,"" using an alternative acronym for ISIS.

[**Last Saturday**](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/26/us-un-assembly-france-syria-idUSKCN0RQ0NX20150926): Syrian President Bashar al-Assad cannot play any role in a future political transition because it would not be credible to the Syrian people after so many deaths at the hands of his government, France's foreign minister said on Saturday.

**[Three Days Ago](http://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/germany-terms-assad-s-departure-vital-to-syria-solution/341604)** Germany’s Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen has said that a long-term political solution to the civil war in Syria requires President Bashar al-Assad’s departure.

“Al-Assad cannot be a part of long-term solution in Syria,” Von der Leyen said in an interview with Berliner Morgenpost daily Monday.",18,0,1443731639,1444718096
