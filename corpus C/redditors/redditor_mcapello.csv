cvxwla3,0,t1_cvxwcz2,mcapello,"Thanks for the feedback!

Not sure what I'm doing with it yet -- but part of the goal was to have the choppy style mirror the MC's mental state (disoriented, unable to think, etc). If I were to continue I'd probably smooth things out as he stabilized.",1,1,1444718574,1444721847
cvxvrfn,1,t3_3ohdgi,mcapello,"It was a lie, if only because Tywin would certainly not let Tyrion live after he threatened his life. If there was *any* chance of Tywin letting him take the black, it was *before* Tyrion escaped and threatened him with a crossbow, certainly not *after*. This would be an unforgivable offense in Tywin's book.",1,1,1444715921,1444721847

Some people will say that all she needs to do is avoid making a mistake. That might have been true 6 months ago. But at this point Clinton's campaign is sagging. So much of her support is based on the sense of inevitability and strength behind her candidacy -- few people actually *like* her. She has to do something to fight her sagging poll numbers -- she's dropped 20 points in the last 3 months. She needs something to do to bridge the ""enthusiasm gap"".",1,1,1444712972,1444721847

That being said... have you considered the possibility that there might be gay and/or black people in France?",1,1,1444710325,1444721847
cvxt7sq,0,t1_cvxsvla,mcapello,"I do not believe it is more efficient. I could be wrong, but my understanding is that conventional outdoor boilers (not outdoor wood gasification boilers) smolder the wood at low temperatures. They release a lot of heavy smoke and VOCs in the process... and also waste a lot of energy, since those VOCs are combustible. It's incomplete combustion.

A wood stove with a secondary combustion system of some type (and these are very common now) are much more efficient, because it completely combusts the wood and converts as much of it as possible into usable heat.

Also depends on what type of building(s) you're heating. An outdoor boiler is a great idea if you have to heat multiple buildings with a single fire.",1,0,1444709652,1444721847

Our society is fucked, but that path was beaten for us a long time ago. It was well-worn by time the Gen X'ers came to adulthood. The worst that can be said about them is that they didn't do anything to avert what's coming.",1,1,1444707138,1444721847
