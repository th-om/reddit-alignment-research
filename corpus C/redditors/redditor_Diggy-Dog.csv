cvxk8zn,0,t1_cvxi70g,Diggy-Dog,"What about these in Exodus 34:

17 “Do not make any idols.

18 “Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt.

19 “The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock.** 20 Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons.**

“No one is to appear before me empty-handed.

21 “Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.

22 “Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year.[b] 23 Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign Lord, the God of Israel. 24 I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the Lord your God.

25 “Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Festival remain until morning.

26 “Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God.

“Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”

27 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” 28 Moses was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.",1,0,1444695164,1444719663
cvxjt1m,0,t1_cvwbwm4,Diggy-Dog,"Regarding 1st Cor., don't the next verses make it clear that those men were saved by their faith?

> 11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God

Regarding Hebrews, when Paul says, ""If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth""  I believe he is talking about rejecting Christ.

One thing for sure, we will not convince each other to change their minds.... lol",1,0,1444694439,1444719663
cvxieuo,0,t1_cvwc3jd,Diggy-Dog,"I read much of what your provided. Overall, I didn't read anything indicating that Scripture itself ended sacrifice.  For several reasons, Jews chose to not rebuild the temple and decide that sacrifice was not needed.  In essence, they chose to no longer follow the OT laws of sacrifice.  Nothing that I know of in the Bible indicates that God ended the system of sacrifice for Jews.",1,0,1444692161,1444719663

cvxhuwc,0,t1_cvwi0h6,Diggy-Dog,"So, your answer to an over-sexed population is killing babies?  Your answer to the possibility of children not being loved is burning them alive?

cvwbart,0,t1_cvwabra,Diggy-Dog,"> The commandments deal with the relationship of Man to God, Man to Man and personal actions. Each one is reinforced in the new testament.

Do you feel pretty confident in this statement, the part about ""each one""?  Because, I'm pretty confident in saying that each one is not reinforced.

Also, what is the signficance of them being reinforced?  I mean, does it say anywhere in Scripture that there's significance to this reinforcement?",1,0,1444604013,1444719663
