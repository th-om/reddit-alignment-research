cvxdkcx,0,t1_cvxbebz,ronin1066,"it depends on what flavor of atheism. If you are truly perplexed, I'll give you a little more. Atheists want evidence. We basically say ""Until there is evidence, I'm not buying it"". Notice the caveat ""until there is evidence"".

I always like to quote Gould:

>... ""fact"" doesn't mean ""absolute certainty""; there ain't no such animal in an exciting and complex world. The final proofs of logic and mathematics flow deductively from stated premises and achieve certainty only because they are not about the empirical world... In science ""fact"" can only mean ""confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional consent."" ",1,0,1444684514,1444718550
cvxdeau,1,t3_3ohxy8,ronin1066,"I'll be honest, I kind of agree with Craig as far as the definition of atheist. It can be a decent debate tactic to ask a xian why they don't believe in any of the other gods and build on that to weaken their stance on xian theism, but to specifically call them an atheist seems disingenuous. It really is semantics, what is the actual definition of atheist, or at least, which version do you prefer?

You're all welcome to try change my view on that if you disagree.",1,0,1444684269,1444718550
