cvtlwif,0,t1_cvtk9kd,BrutePhysics,"In America there is a significant push by certain segments to run everything ""like a business"" or to privitize everything. The vast majority of our schools are technically government, but because we don't invest in them and we often mismanage them they often turn to these kinds of stunts to get funding.

cvq4dak,0,t1_cvq494q,BrutePhysics,"Seriously?  A knife wielder could easily kill many many people if those people are all asleep.  A knife wielder would have a very difficult time killing 5+ awake and aware people in a group, gun-free zone or not.

On the other hand, a gun wielder could easily kill 5+ people with indiscriminate shooting whether those people are awake or asleep or in a gun-free zone or not.

The odds of a single knife wielder taking on and killing 5 (let alone 50) other equally sized and aware individuals is miniscule.  Not impossible, but a hell of a lot less likely than one guy with a gun vs 5 people.",6,0,1444141862,1444717388
cvq0tt3,0,t1_cvpsy08,BrutePhysics,"Having lived in both rural and very urban places I'll say that it's not cars themselves i hate but the absolute necessity of cars. I hate that this small town is so spread out i have to drive for every single thing. If i wasnt to do anything at all i have to use my car to get there. 

In a big city i can reliably walk or bike to the vast majority of my daily errands. This is dangerous even if i wanted to go the long distance here because there are no consistent sidewalks. In a big city i could read/game/chill out on the bus or metro to one-in-a-while events or to work. Here the public transport is so sparse it might as well not exist. Etc...etc...

There have been over 70 school shootings (just school shootings, not including mass shootings not related to school) in the last 18 months.  That's almost 1 *per week*.  Name me one other first-world nation in the world that has a rate like that.  Hell, I'm willing to bet that if you combined *all* other first world nations together you wouldn't get a rate of 1 school shooting per week.",4,0,1443791307,1444717388
