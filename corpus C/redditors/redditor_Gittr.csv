I mean, do I really have to explain this? Don't you realize the US media establishment is on lockdown? If it goes against the narrative, it gets silenced. If it gets silenced, no one cares except patriots that do not listen to the Media establishment. Barely any criticism gets through to Obama. Obama is the most protected President of all time. The shit he gets away with is amazing. These things are a big deal. Do your research if you dont believe me. 

Do you know how many garbage excuses I've read for those scandals? Its a fucking **joke.**

Imagine if r/politics wasnt biased and blind? They would be throwing a fit right now at how Putin nationally embarrassed Obama, *again*. But nope! Silence. Just more drivel on how Republicans are evil and greedy etc and how Sanders is great. 
Hell, this other clown brings up a somewhat obscure scandal from **Reagan 30 years ago**. Why dont you question him? Why not direct this backhanded question to him? Oh wait, its Reagan - its a Republican. That scandal *matters*. Oh yes. because of big bad Reagan.

cvubeqz,0,t1_cvu6rw3,Gittr,"> Do I even have to name the fallacy here? Is anarcho-capitalist Bryan Caplan not a libertarian? What about Milton Friedman?

If they support major government intervention in the countries' monetary system then they are not economically Libertarian, whether they be Bryan Caplan, Milton Friedman or anyone else. 

Now, how we define ""major"" is up for debate, but that is the general idea. 

>It's not like they have conducted research, see also here, and here and found that the countries that got off the gold standard the quickest had the fastest recoveries and every time the dollar was devalued industrial production soared. 

I can conduct research as well. I can conduct a very long research paper that support my claims and ignore opposing evidence, especially in a psuedo-science (No, economics is not a hard science), especially if I am someone like Ben Bernanke with ties to schools like Princeton that teach and enforce government backed economic principles, and that make me the future Fed Chairman. That, by the way, are doomed to fail. 

You know, I can't believe you showed me a research paper from Ben Bernanke, and the one that talks about the Gold Standard and the Great Depression. More regurgitated nonsense - **oh the irony**. Of course he is going to tout how the gold standard is bad. It is called the fox guarding the henhouse. The Gold Standard was not responsible for the engineered Great Depression. Yes, the Gold Standard that was margined 100 to 1. Yes, the Gold Standard, its no coincidence that the banks at the time acquired tons and tons of gold, and then devalued the dollar so people would buy into it, and abolish it later. 

And then have your successor attempt to rewrite history and ignore key factors in a psuedo-science paper that gets passed around on Reddit.

But don't worry, its been [debunked, and not just by him](http://libertymaven.com/2008/12/27/bernankes-great-lie-the-gold-standard-and-the-great-depression-part-22/3798/)

Keynes believed that when the private sector economy was struggling, it could be accelerated and turned into growth by public-sector deficit spending. By incurring a temporary deficit, the private sector could be supercharged to the point where the additional tax revenue generated would eliminate the newly created public debt. Keynesian economics says that we should have cyclical public deficit â€“ one that rises temporarily, then returns to zero in a cycle.

So let's take a look, around 45 years ago the government ended the Gold Standard and handed the reigns over to the central bankers. 

Now, let's take a look at the total public debt:

https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GFDEBTN

There is no deficit cycle. It's structural. See how you are advocating madness? Keynesian economics is insanity. It doesn't work. When will people get it? We are running a fake economy. And yet here you are, *still defending* Keynesian economics. Its mindblowing.

He can call himself a Libertarian but again, if he advocates major government intervention in the free market then he is not a Libertarian. It's really that simple.

Plenty of ideological diversity... right.... probably as much diversity as my backyard. (not much). 

>Except, you know, the billion prices index that I linked to you, and the fact he admitted he just added a few points to the CPI

Whoop de doo. Does MIT maintain a page similar to Shadowstats where they calculate the real numbers? No? Okay then, Shadowstats it is. It is a moot point. 

>Again, it advocates stimulus of either monetary or fiscal form (or both) during recessions. 

I don't really care. You're trying to explain it away. You're trying very hard - and I give you props for that - but the bottom line is the bottom line. Keynesianism does not work. Why? 

Because it doesnt take into account **human interests in power**. Its theory without practical application (common sense). It's pure academic hogwash. It gives alot of power to a very small amount of individuals. Central Banking. And - surprise - it doesn't work. 

It doesnt take into account that these individuals form cartels. They form cartels between banks and governments. The proof is right before your very eyes, and it has already happened and is currently happening as we speak. 

These people decide currencies, how we spend them, where we spend, who we bailout, what interest rates are set at, how much is lent...its too much. It creates an environment that facilitates crony capitalism. Why should they decide how other people spend their money? I think it makes more sense if the individual manages their money, not others to do it for them.

Cartels put their interests before others. They dont care about the Golden Goose, just the Golden Egg. 

>The sub is fairly centrist on economic issues.

No, the sub is full of madmen birthed from our Ivory Tower colleges that push the lie of Keynesianism. And it's not that hard to see. You're trying desperately to explain away their positions, but the proof is there when the rubber hits the road.

1) I had someone on there tell me Debt-To-GDP ratio is what we should be concerned about and not total debt. That's outrageous and insanity. I am not going to debate that again, it's nuts, you see my reply. 

2) I had someone tell me that Fiat currency is great. Gold is not. What a joke. And then I realized he was serious. Gold has been around for thousands of years. It's madness. But, they think 19 trillions in debt is nothing to be concerned with, so OK.

3)  I had someone tell me our economy is doing fine. And then I proceeded to provide him 10 statistics that proved otherwise.

So far you've done nothing except prove to us that you believe nearly **everything that university tells you to believe.** So, thank you for proving my point. I respect your opinions and dont fully blame you, more or less the system that does all this.

I am done debating these points. Believe what you will.

*If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks...will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.""*

>You weren't debating a college liberal who has been sheltered from conservative viewpoints, you were debating a libertarian with an economics degree.

AHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!

Libertarian? Libertarian my ass. Don't lie like that. I am a *real* Libertarian, and I can spot a fake a mile away. No true Libertarian or Conservative supports Keynesian economics. NO ONE. 

Ohhhh! An Economics degree? You mean a degree in Indoctrination? You mean a degree in ""I will regurgitate what my professor tells me""? You guys crack me up. Make sure to shine up that cute little degree on your wall.

Shadowstats has not been debunked, its been questioned, and quite frankly theres no one else out there reliability doing the research on these borked government numbers. So it's the best we've got. 

That consensus in the gold standard is bogus, I already explained that. Just because a bunch of college professor STOOGES come to an ""agreement"" on the Gold Standard doesn't mean shit. It means nothing. It means they either believe their own bullshit or they are cowards and go with the establishment.

>Keynes advocates stimulus in the time of depressions, in which resources are not being completely utilized and we have tons of people out of work. 

Keynesian economics is the economics of the elites that run this country. It's called **Crony Capitalism.** It's economic communism. It uses central banking and government regulation to prop up fake economies like this one. It believes that the economy cannot run itself. It advocates HUGE GOVERNMENT. Its the exact OPPOSITE of Libertarianism and free markets, and what America was founded on! It's madness. [It is wrong and it will always be wrong.](http://politicalvelcraft.org/2013/11/30/ron-paul-healthy-capitalism-vs-paul-krugman-keynesian-mafia-economics/) 

And you call it a Libertarian sub. What a joke.

If it was a Libertarian sub it would advocate Austrian Capitalist economics - otherwise known as the Free Market.

I made a post on here about our economy and was pulled into r/badeconomics. Alot of what they posted was actually Strawman, my original post never contained what they argued against, but you can see my [rebuttal](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/3nawjy/wake_up_sheeple_we_need_a_gold_standard/cvmi3qt). I was pretty stunned by what I was reading.

I felt like I was back in college, and not in a good way.

Basically, they advocate Keynesian economics, which justifies centralized banking, overspending, debt accumulation and socialist policies. They are teaching that debt isn't something to be concerned about. Yep, this is the **madness** that is being taught. This is what our Universities teach, even though its pretty much been proven to be wrong time and time again. Keynesian economics is part of why we're in the economic trouble that we are in. 

Universities are basically radical left-wing Ivory Tower indoctrination centers. Some of the ""hard"" sciences are still good, like Physics, but the ""soft"" and social sciences - Psychology, Economics, Political Science, Philosophy - have been infiltrated and taken over by Radical left wing thought police that are justifying national suicide.
