cvmdhvr,0,t1_cvm0t0i,moriya_,"Depends on where you put it.  Obviously sketches are usually on the small side compared to a lot of hung art, so if it's the only thing on an otherwise bare wall it might look a bit empty.  Which could be something you want, but if not then having a few similar pieces to hang next to each other could make the wall a little less empty.

On the other hand, if you have a smaller alcove area, mantle, or a side table or something to hang it in/above, then even a smaller piece like a sketch would probably look fine on its own.

In the end its about whether you like the look of course, and I'm just giving a few examples.",3,0,1443837397,1444729124
cvm0kpq,0,t1_cvlr9sb,moriya_,"There's plenty of nice ways to frame and hang a sketch!  The easiest is probably a simple solid color frame and a white (or light color) mat/backing.  Some examples: [white frames](https://www.thedoganddobbin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Justine-Osbourne-prints-x4-framed.jpg), [dark wooden frames](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/30/ce/3c/30ce3ced19731684b1469391d68138fc.jpg), [metal frames](http://www.cincinnatiarts.org/assets/img/johnston-roy-transformation-series-10-lit.jpg), [silver frames with no mat](http://guideimg.alibaba.com/images/shop/102/01/26/3/set-of-4-gestural-flower-study-sketches-framed-print-wall-art-25_2899913.jpg)

Of course, it also depends on the room it's going to hang in. If your living room is something simple ([for example](https://minimalisthome.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/minimalist-living-room-with-wooden-furniture.jpg)), some framed sketches could fit in pretty easily.  On the other hand, if your living room looks like [this](http://iss.zillowstatic.com/image/traditional-living-room-with-marble-floors-i_g-IS-1ds0r5h2lv61p-PjhzU.jpg) then a sketch is going to have a hard time standing out.",21,0,1443813853,1444729124
cv3zhqn,0,t1_cv3wezf,moriya_,"That adage is definitely *less* true in MOBA games than elsewhere, since even normal people will run into assholes on a fairly regular basis.  You'd probably need to beef it up go with something like:

cuavn7h,0,t1_cuau68k,moriya_,"Actually, it's only possible to view another player's character's current equipment (and skill tree) if they have a non-private profile.  The website won't show inventory or stash tabs for any character except your own.  So, if they do have a way to view other player's inventories, they're probably exploiting some vulnerability on the website, which sounds like a good way to get banned.

Personally, I won't believe that claim until someone posts a proof-of-concept for viewing another player's inventory.",4,0,1440178237,1444729124

cteud13,0,t1_ctepa0x,moriya_,"Basically, during the 2012 primary the more conservative part of the GOP didn't like the moderate Romney, so they kept rallying behind different alternative candidates until each one eventually did something stupid enough to disqualify themselves.  Herman Cain was one of the candidates who managed to ride that wave and be the front runner in the polls for a few weeks in late 2011.  With that in mind, it makes sense that Cain and the others who rode the same wave were fairly conservative, since the voting block that pushed them temporarily into the spotlight was also very conservative.

That said, from what I remember of Cain he didn't really talk much about concrete policy, so he felt like one of the less conservative from that group of candidates.  The only thing I really remember him talking about was his ""9-9-9"" flat tax plan and his background as a CEO.  I don't really remember anything about his social policy (though I wouldn't be surprised if it was very conservative), and he seemed like he had basically no clue about foreign policy (see: ""uzbekibekibekistanstan"").",5,0,1437761763,1444729124
