cvxxelz,1,t3_3ojww0,rebamericana,"Second the FI case for grad school. I went the route of weekend and evening classes for my masters which allowed me to work full-time and not accumulate any debt. Also got a full-time paid internship that was only available to full-time students at the government agency where I've worked ever since. I got this job, of course, through the friend of a classmate. I'm making more now than my peers at my last job/career. 

Just wanted to add this example for those not keen on going into debt for grad school. Also, I didn't want to leave the workforce at that point in my life and step off a cliff by graduating without a job already. ",1,0,1444721564,1444728098
cvnesep,0,t1_cvndp3u,rebamericana,Exactly this. Speak with a period and not a question mark at the end. ,2,0,1443927220,1444728098

cvelj3z,0,t1_cvejhbt,rebamericana,Ah good call. I just saw that they started streaming videos online but I don't know if I can check them out. Huge fan of the library. Thanks for the reminder! Heading there tomorrow. ,1,0,1443249188,1444728098
cvejand,0,t1_cvdvo9z,rebamericana,"Slow moving sounds just right. For me at least! Also, he'll have a sibling coming soon so Stella and Sam could be a good way to help guide some of those conversations. ",1,0,1443242036,1444728098
cve6icu,0,t1_cve1voh,rebamericana,"Good idea. I'd have to do it quickly cuz we're leaving soon, and will be gone for longer than our library's checkout period. We're all into not spending money these days so, far better option. ",1,0,1443215407,1444728098
cvdvu9j,0,t1_cvdp3jg,rebamericana,Sounds great for his age. Thank you! We'll check it out. ,1,0,1443198337,1444728098
cvdvtf7,0,t1_cvdn64f,rebamericana,That's a solid recommendation. Thanks!,1,0,1443198299,1444728098

cvdvreq,0,t1_cvdgznk,rebamericana,That's exactly the type of advice I was looking for. Will look into a YouTube downloader. And Baby Einstein. I was looking for something with a plot because it seems my son could watch endless videos of garbage trucks and construction on YouTube but we want to develop his imagination a bit more. I'd probably like BE as much as he would. Thanks!,1,0,1443198214,1444728098
