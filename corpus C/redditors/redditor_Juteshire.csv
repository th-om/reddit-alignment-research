No doubt, no doubt. Our state isn't always the most active -- although we come close from time to time -- but we're always the most controversial, it seems.",1,0,1444461004,1444729685
cvul5up,0,t1_cvukj3l,Juteshire,">I was more than a bit harsh, I'm sorry. I come from another political sim, where I was used to being constantly under fire. I will make it a point to be less frustrating in the future.

I know the feeling well, and as I said, I'm primed to retaliate. Hopefully we'll both be able to improve our behavior in the near future; and then we can inspire the rest of the state to do the same. :P

>Regarding the judiciary issue, will you commit to doing everything within your power to amend the constitution to require only a simple majority for court rulings, as the Chief Justice suggests?

There's nothing that can be done right now, but state elections will end on the 23rd, and then -- if I am reelected as Speaker, which I hope to be -- I will ensure that solving these judicial issues is the first course of action pursued by the 3rd Assembly. I imagine that most citizens of the Western State share our sentiment, and I hope that even if I am not reelected, my replacement will do the same.

>I will help however I can. As a newb, the fact that this sim has a functional judiciary system was extremely attractive. I want to make this work!

We do have a fairly comprehensive system in this simulation. It's still a bit rough at the state level, but we're working it out quickly, I think.

Are you planning on running for State Legislator next term (assuming you're a citizen of this state, which is a risky assumption to make since our state seems to attract a lot of outside attention these days)? Even if you don't, if you want to play an active role in the state, there are certainly plenty of ways to get involved even without being elected.",1,0,1444459037,1444729685
cvuk867,0,t1_cvtgqz9,Juteshire,"I'll begin with this: there's no mud to be thrown on either side, and I'm sorry that I retaliated against the perceived insults levied against me as I did. If you spend much time here you'll soon learn that it's not in my personality to take insults lightly. Honor is sacred, you know; but I hope to foster a spirit of mutual respect within our state which protects the honor of all involved and thus frees us from this sort of petty verbal jousting.

>If you were aware of such a request from the Chief Justice, why did you not move to draft and pass such an amendment? Was his request made after you stopped accepting new bills? I am honestly curious, here.

Because he made the request only a couple days ago and the term ends today. Anything brought up in the past two weeks or so had no chance of making it onto the legislative docket before the end of the term; certainly anything in the past few days constitutionally *couldn't* have been pushed through even if I manipulated the docket (which I'm technically constitutionally permitted to do) in order to move it to the front. It's a matter of timing, unfortunately.

>I had already read over the post that /u/Trips_93 linked to. That's the point of this whole entire argument. I was surprised that you had not seen it yet.

I had seen it but I had probably only skimmed it (as I don't have much interest in dense legal matters and I try to avoid the judicial subreddits when possible) and didn't digest the Chief Justice's request until /u/Trips_93 kindly provided the link for me to refresh my admittedly imperfect memory.",1,0,1444455742,1444729685
cvuk1ed,0,t1_cvujun8,Juteshire,">Perhaps the concern on the bench is that without three justices (as required in the Constitution) it is inappropriate for them to rule on cases especially given the unanimous decision rule (unanimity is a less substantial burden when there is a single vacancy)? I can only speculate, but it is their place to interpret the rules and the Constitution so I would presume they are acting pursuant to that interpretation.

As I was reminded by /u/Trips_93, the absence of an Associate Justice was only half of the reason that the Court has suspended its operations. The other half of the reason is that they feel the constitutional unanimity requirement hinders the Court's ability to operate fairly and effectively in carrying out its constitutional duties.

My point is simply this: you indicated that it wasn't the role of the judicial branch to recommend legislative action, and if that's the case, then the judicial branch shouldn't be suspending its operations simply because the legislative branch hasn't taken the action that it recommended.

I hold a slightly different view, which is that when potential legislative action will directly affect the fundamental operational structure of the Court, it is appropriate for the Justices to comment on legislative action and for the Assembly to seriously consider those comments.",2,0,1444455156,1444729685
cvujt5r,0,t1_cvujmmw,Juteshire,"[State elections are tentatively scheduled to end on the 23rd](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/3l3g9s/electoral_roll_october_2015_election_discussion/), so hopefully in about two weeks the Governor-elect will nominate a candidate for Associate Justice and the 3rd Assembly will confirm (or not confirm) that candidate.

I expect that the first priorities of the 3rd Assembly will be amending the Constitution in line with the Chief Justice's recommendations and confirming the Governor-elect's nominee for Associate Justice. I'll be running for Speaker of the Assembly again, and those will certainly be my priorities if I am reelected, but I think that getting the Court up and running again is a goal shared by most citizens of our state.",1,0,1444454463,1444729685
cvujfqe,0,t1_cvufkcd,Juteshire,">Even if that were the case, why hasn't one been confirmed? By the constitution there SHALL be three justices. When a justice is inactive he SHALL be replaced. The Governor SHALL appoint.

>What is preventing the nomination process? The administration of justice in Western State is completely suspended right now. Shouldn't resolving that issue be a paramount concern for the existing government?

Two Justices departed the Court: the Chief Justice resigned, and a week later an Associate Justice was booted for inactivity. We replaced the Chief Justice, as was our constitutional duty, but by the time the Associate Justice was constitutionally booted, the legislative docket was full, as it was less than two weeks before the end of the term. Besides, it often takes more than a few days for the Governor to locate a suitable replacement; after all, he has a duty to locate the most competent nominee possible before nominating them. We've done our best to fulfill our constitutional duties in a timely manner, but sometimes that is impossible, because in the real world, issues like this often pop up at the most inconvenient possible times.

tl;dr the term is ending now (like literally within the next hour or so), the Associate Justice was booted only two weeks ago, and the docket was already full when that happened.",1,0,1444453422,1444729685
cvuja00,0,t1_cvufmbn,Juteshire,">Is it the role of the Judicial Branch to advocate for legislation? Is that not the duty of the legislature?

By this logic, the State Supreme Court should continue operating, because the Assembly already approved the Constitution and the Court shouldn't be interfering in legislative affairs.

Look, if the Chief Justice believes that the Court is structured in an unfair manner or just a manner which is less than fully conducive to the work that the Court needs to do, then the Assembly will address his concerns. And he has, so the next Assembly will, no doubt.",1,0,1444453006,1444729685
cvtg6d3,0,t1_cvtfnxi,Juteshire,">I've been playing for less than two full days, and even I've read through that post and know about that requirement. It is pretty incredible that our Speaker would know less about such an important issue than a new citizen.

You think it's pretty incredible that someone who read the constitution in the past two days would remember more about it than someone who read it more than two months ago? Either you think I have a photographic memory - in which case I suppose I'm flattered, but I must confess that I don't - or you're trying to throw mud where there's no mud to be thrown.

>If all it will take to change this is a statement from our Chief Justice, I'm sure that can be arranged.

What it will take to change this is a supermajority in the Assembly in favor of amending the constitution in such a way that the requirement is reduced. We currently have such a supermajority, but unfortunately the term ends later today and I stopped accepting bills almost a week ago. Next term, if such a supermajority is elected - and I'm confident that it will be, if the voters desire it - then the change will be implemented.

Incidentally, the Chief Justice has already requested such a change, which is why I brought him up at all. It's pretty incredible that someone willing to brag about the relative breadth of their knowledge on a subject would have failed to click the link that was provided literally two posts up which would have allowed them to comment on this issue in an informed and potentially constructive manner.",1,0,1444371791,1444729685
cvs1f4y,0,t1_cvs0ya1,Juteshire,">You know perfectly well you're not being honest here. Both of the sitting justices want the constitution amended so only a simple majority is required to overrturn a statute.

I don't know I'm not being honest because I forgot that we put that requirement in the constitution and I didn't see that post because I only ever skim threads that look like they might descend into legalese.

Anyway, I don't remember who proposed that requirement - it certainly wasn't me - and I think that most of my fellow Distributist Legislators would be willing to amend it at the request of the Chief Justice. You sense a conspiracy, but conspiracies involve ill intent, and I assure you that such a sentiment is absent within my party.

>Which is probably exactly why you dont have 3 distributists on the Western Supreme Court, because you dont need 3, just 1.

But that's like saying that we only want 51% (or whatever is necessary for a bare minimum victory) of the vote in an election. That would be imbecilic.

Besides, perhaps next term the Socialist Party will come into power and it would have been advantageous for us to have had three Distributist Justices who would be likely to strike down egregious laws. You assume that we're either dumb or overconfident; we're neither.

>I more take issue with the fact you said Western voters have to register 1 week before state elections are announced.

As I said before, this is to prevent non-citizens from voting.",1,0,1444269943,1444729685
