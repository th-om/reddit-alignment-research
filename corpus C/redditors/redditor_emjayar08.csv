cvk3cl5,0,t1_cvk075n,emjayar08,"Im talking about taking 3-4 seconds to get up vs the 1 second in this game.  Dont act like players dont get the wind knocked out of them, get concussed or just get hit real fuckin hard.  ",5,0,1443667369,1444728742
cvjrhc0,0,t1_cvjr1fj,emjayar08,"I would prefer if the player that got hit would stay on the ice a bit longer like they do in real life.  They have to regain traction on the ice, collect themselves, and then get up by using all their strength, then they think about getting back in the play.  In this game, the player quickly gets back up and goes for the puck.  I very rarely see that in a real life game.",2,0,1443647527,1444728742
cvjrfgk,0,t1_cvjpoux,emjayar08,"no, in real life 9 times out of 10 the player that is hit stays on the ice for a few seconds to collect himself.  There is none of that in this game.  I dont think it'd be much of a fix to patch it in this game.",0,0,1443647452,1444728742
