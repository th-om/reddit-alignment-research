cvxvpoh,1,t3_3oixgc,NonHomogenized,">  She claimed that it would ruin the economy and prices would skyrocket

I'm going to recycle a post I made a few days ago on the subject of price increases due to the minimum wage increasing to $15/hour:

Generally, prices will increase the most at places where they rely the most on minimum wage labor - the prototypical example is fast food, where something like 30% of their expenses are the cost of labor, almost all of which is near-minimum wage.

Earlier this year, researchers at [Purdue University did a study](http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q3/study-raising-wages-to-15-an-hour-for-limited-service-restaurant-employees-would-raise-prices-4.3-percent.html) on the effects of raising the minimum wage to $15/hour on limited-service restaurant (aka 'fast food' restaurants) prices, and found that it would only necessitate an increase of 4.3%.

That is, if you were paying $7.50 for your Big Mac meal before, you would now be paying $7.83 for your meal. If your Big Mac was $4, the price goes up less than $.20.

This is somewhat more favorable than most other studies I've seen on the subject, but the general principle still holds true:

For example, the [Center for Economic and Policy Research](http://cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf) did a review on the topic of minimum wage increases back in 2013, and found:

> Sara Lemos has conducted a comprehensive review of the 30 or so academic papers on the price effects of the minimum wage. She concludes: ""Despite the different methodologies, data periods and data sources, most studies reviewed above found that a 10% US minimum wage increase raises
food prices by no more than 4% and overall prices by no more than 0.4%""; and ""[t]he main policy recommendation deriving from such findings is that policy makers can use the minimum wage to increase the wages of the poor, without destroying too many jobs or causing too much inflation.""

> Neumark and Wascher agree with Lemos's assessment about the likely price effects (while disagreeing with her conclusions about the overall usefulness of the minimum wage): ""Both because of the relatively small share of production costs accounted for by minimum wage labor and because of the limited spillovers from a minimum wage increase to wages of other workers, the effect of a minimum wage increase on the overall price level is likely to be small."" Other recent research by Daniel Aaronson, Eric French, and James MacDonald on restaurant pricing, a sector with a high
share of low-wage workers suggests that the price effects are likely to be lower than the upper bounds suggested by Lemos. Aaronson, French, and MacDonald ""find that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage increases prices by roughly 0.7 percent.""

Obviously, these estimates are intended for smaller increases, but we can still use them to get a sense of what the literature suggests about the effect on prices. So, using the highest of these numbers, we get a doubling of the minimum wage increasing fast food prices by about half, and using the lowest, an increase of about 7%. That means your $7.50 meal might go up to anywhere from about $8 to about $11.25.

Hell, even if you want to use to use wholly unreliable right-wing sources like the [Heritage Foundation](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/09/higher-fast-food-wages-higher-fast-food-prices) to get the scariest numbers they can come up with, you *still* don't get doubling the minimum wage leading to a doubling in prices: their study found that a $15/hour minimum wage would increase fast food prices by about 38%, which would still only put your $7.50 meal up to $10.35.",1,1,1444715778,1444716880

FYI, there was originally a typo: they switched Biden and Sanders' numbers. It was supposed to be Biden 24%, Sanders 18%.

Which, I mean, at the beginning of September, he was polling at 9% in SC according to PPP, and in late September, 13% according to Gravis, so 18% is still an upward trend. And 65% of SC likely democratic primary voters reported they were 'still trying to decide' who to support (other options being 'leaning towards someone' and 'definitely decided'), so her support there may well be the proverbial mile wide and an inch deep.",1,1,1444713707,1444716880

> Holy shit dude, thats a pretty big fucking leap.

Back to... the same top tax rate as we had in 1986, which applied at a [lower](http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/fed_individual_rate_history_adjusted.pdf) inflation-adjusted income (*much* lower for those not married filing jointly).

> Like, a leap big enough to make me question

It's not as big a leap as you seem to think. If your AGI were $500,000 and you're a married couple filing jointly (mind you, only approximately 0.7% of households make this much per year), instead of paying ~$147k in federal income tax, you'd pay about $159k, or about 8% more in federal income tax.

> OKay, but just raising taxes on everyone above $400,000

...which constitutes approximately *1%* of households in the US.

Yeah, and Universities fund a lot of new innovations, too. A *lot*.

> Education is not a right, it is a privilege--always has been and always will be.

Then... you don't support free (ie tax-funded) public schools for primary and secondary education?

How did that work out at preventing, say, the Vietnam conflict? 

And how would it *not* still be a volunteer army, unless you're making service *mandatory*, rather than a requirement for free college?

Also, having multiple different payment systems to deal with always makes the financial administration more complex, and makes it more difficult to control costs.

That there will be 'less jobs' seems to be an unwarranted assumption.

> Does China? India? Russia? Any country that is our size? 

Why does the size of the country matter? What diseconomy of scale is at work which would make the policy fine in a smaller country, but not in a larger one?

To answer your question, though, at least most public universities in Brazil are tuition-free, and they have a population of 200 million.

> Property taxes are already high enough, you think people will be happy a higher income tax (or whatever tax).

First, it could be funded through income taxes *without* most people having to pay a higher income tax (and, of course, they wouldn't have to worry about paying for college for themselves or their children); raising the [top two tax brackets' tax rates by 1 percentage point would raise close to $10 billion per year](https://www.cbo.gov/budget-options/2013/44794), which suggests raising only taxes on people making $400,000/year or more from a top marginal rate of 39.6% to 50% would *more* than cover the estimated [$62 billion per year](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/heres-exactly-how-much-the-government-would-have-to-spend-to-make-public-college-tuition-free/282803/) required. Or, you know, we could just cut the Pentagon's budget by 10% and not raise taxes.

Second, Bernie Sanders' proposal is to pay for it through a small financial transaction tax, which most people would never even notice (especially so since a large percentage of Americans have no investments).

Third, growing the economy allows you to do more while taking the same percentage in taxes.

Virtually everything is subject to supply and demand; that isn't really an argument.

Having a more educated populace is good for the country, because it means more educated citizens making decisions (both political and economic), and allows a higher concentration of jobs requiring a more sophisticated labor force.
