And while I politically align more closely to Bernie Sanders, I don't think that they're really so far apart on the political spectrum that it would make a meaningful difference.",4,0,1443887858,1444719647

cv4d53i,1,t3_3l95ye,JPAIN7,"I thought Graham was dominating the discussion and came off looking very strong and articulate. Also his jokes were on point. Jindal like did a good job appealing to the conservative wing. We'll see who comes out ahead. Personally I think Graham will leap frog over Jindal and Paul.

As for Santorum and Pataki, they seem like they're becoming more and more irrelevant. Santorum seemed all over the place (although his talk about min wage workers was good) and Pataki appeared far too moderate.",3,0,1442463763,1444719647

cukcr9p,0,t1_cukavmd,JPAIN7,"What do you know. Someone who supports preserving ""the European way of life"" is also sexist, transphobic, homophobic, Orientalist, and thinks racism is OK. Just so you all know whose side you're taking...",-12,0,1440901804,1444719647
cub5tva,0,t1_cub4ye7,JPAIN7,"You made it a race and ethnic issue when you stereotyped people of Middle Eastern and North African descent. You complain about them being uneducated, yet you want to prevent them from finding a better life in Europe for their children. You're clearly not a progressive who wants to see a better life for all people. You just want to better your own life and the lives of those just like you at the expense of others. Why don't you just call yourself what you are? You're a right-wing populist.",0,0,1440193989,1444719647

Like I said, while that certainly isn't illegal, it's not ok for a 25 or 30 year old person to be thinking about pubescent teens in a sexual manner.

ctywi1c,0,t1_ctyurhi,JPAIN7,"What kind of jump did you make to get from age-of-consent laws to child prostitution. That's some serious pedophile apologia right there.

Look OP, if you want some advice: look up the age-of-consent laws in your state/province/country, and use that as a strict guideline for dating/sex. While it's certainly not illegal to look at boys 5+ years younger than you on Instagram, you might want to ween yourself off of the habit. Maybe seek psychological help if things get really bad.",3,0,1439274672,1444719647
