After all, they're also constantly parroting Bernie's argument that economic growth is useless and that we need forced wealth redistribution instead.

cvxjhte,0,t1_cvxhqno,BoiseNTheHood,"> I'm sure that the money coming from the 1% will be more than enough to pay for what he has planned.

""The 1%"" does not have unlimited money.  Even if 100% of all income over $1 million were taxed, it would only generate [about $616 billion.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danbigman/2012/04/03/john-stossel-tax-the-rich-the-rich-dont-have-enough-really/)  (That article is from 2012, but it's the most recent figure I could find and I doubt it's changed that much.)  That would cover 17.5% of what the federal government spent in 2014.  It'd cover 16.3% of what the federal government has spent so far in 2015.  

Bernie's rhetoric that ""taxing the rich"" is the solution to all our problems is pure fantasy.  Factoring in the inevitable capital flight that would occur if Bernie became president and had a compliant Congress to push his agenda, there is no way in hell that the middle class wouldn't get bent over to fund his vast redistribution schemes.

Bernie's economic plans fall apart under any slight modicum of scrutiny.  They are only popular because the politics of envy and victimhood are appealing to some people.",8,0,1444693923,1444716443

> A socialist wants workers to control everything.

When every socialist country inevitably leads to a central government stepping in to act as the ""workers/public,"" controlling everything on their behalf, the definition of socialism needs to adjust to reality.",1,0,1444692791,1444716443
cvxelv7,0,t1_cvx618w,BoiseNTheHood,"> abortion didn't become as political of an issue til the late 70s

Roe v. Wade didn't come out of nowhere.  Abortion had been a political issue since the mid-1800s.  Physicians, the AMA, and in an ironic twist of fate, prominent early feminists (such as Matilda Gage, Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton) led the charge to get it banned back then.  

The shift towards legalized abortion began with Margaret Sanger and the birth control movement back in the 1920s.  While Sanger stopped short of advocating for abortion herself, the movement shifted the public view of sexuality and established women's reproductive rights as a political issue, paving the way for pro-choice activism, liberalization of abortion laws, and Roe v. Wade.",4,0,1444686089,1444716443

cvx7tih,0,t1_cvx6vw6,BoiseNTheHood,"To be fair, the Koch brothers' money and influence could *make* a libertarian candidate viable.  After all, fundraising and media time are the two major obstacles that a third-party candidate faces.

I don't see how pissing away their money on a failed neocon like Scott Walker did anything to advance the cause of libertarianism.  Even if he was able to stay in the race and win, we'd end up getting 4-8 more years of statism from the executive branch.  It makes one wonder how libertarian the Kochs really are.",0,0,1444676333,1444716443
