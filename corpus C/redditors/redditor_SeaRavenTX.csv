The correct answer is: *if he gave me a piece of yarn to wrap around my finger, so long as he loves me, that's all I need...*  

...not your spoiled brat, bridezilla, entitled, vapid, materialistic, daddy's-girl response.",2,0,1444713030,1444729661

cvxhb16,1,t3_3ogrpu,SeaRavenTX,"I feel like there should be a solution to the gun debate.  We may have to look at the motive of the forefathers including this right in the Second Amendment.  Obviously, it was written during a time when American Independence was fresh on the mind.  We were viewed as a colony and the British Empire had to be kept in check from amassing large groups of soldiers to our sovereign land.  The 2nd Amendment also explicitly uses the word militia as a necessity for the security of a free state.  My question is, how can we make our gun culture more about a militia and less about giving EVERYONE arms?  There has to be some merit behind granting every single untrained citizen a gun.  Just fyi, I live in Texas and I'm ex-military.   I love guns, but anything that resembles open carry on a school campus is ridiculous.  Going on hike? Ok.  Going to leave it in your car? Sure.  School though seems like too much of a stretch, even for me...",-1,0,1444690346,1444729661
