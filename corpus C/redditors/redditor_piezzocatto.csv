cvrkue2,0,t1_cvqxkhq,piezzocatto,Exactly.  Reasons open you up to suspicion.,1,0,1444243818,1444729791
cvo9cnu,0,t1_cvo0hca,piezzocatto,"Yes. That's precisely the point. 

Whoever gets into power, especially with a majority, is never happy about the pace of progress of their preferences through the legislature.  The Senate is literally there to slow things down, and provide a sort of inertia into government.  This is the reason why its not proportional, and why it has long terms.

Consider it as a way to arrive at a time based moving average of preferences.  Even populists then have to negotiate with the other side.

I think it is precisely this that makes multicameral government so good at making stable societies and economies. Firstly because the majority can't oppress the minority, and secondly because we never have to worry about a sudden election landslide completely upending our mid term plans.",2,0,1443996327,1444729791

cvmra8h,0,t1_cvmo5mf,piezzocatto,"There's some Danish bloke that stabbed someone to death over a cartoon.  Frenchmen shot up a newspaper office for pretty much the same reason.  People are routinely burned in the street in parts of the world for being gay.  Other places feature mob stoning over rumors.

I agree that some cultures are more temperamental than others, but I don't think Americans are  uniquely or even comparatively ""nuts"".",1,0,1443883693,1444729791
