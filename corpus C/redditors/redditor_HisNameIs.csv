cvonh1v,1,t3_3ni7ng,HisNameIs,"DemocracyNow.org Amy Goodman is an amazing award-winning journalist and her organization is straight-forward news, no frills or tangents or gossip, and their interviews are well structured. Plus it's free online whenever you want. 

Also TheRealNewsNetwork (trnn.com) has phenomenal video journalism, and specializes in putting news into context - they do whole segments on topics similar. 

Lastly I would say John Oliver's show - it's not necessarily ""new"" news but it covers some topics in-depth that many consider vital to our understanding of national and international happenings.",3,0,1444022664,1444718730

cvj8juh,0,t1_cvj5r28,HisNameIs,"I wouldn't say that the statistics are worthless when you begin a discussion of racially-charged incarceration. One doesn't counteract the other - you can still have the statistics while keeping in mind that police in that area may be racially motivated. To determine the latter you would have to do more of an ethnography, and if racial bias is found then the statistics are useful in that regard as well.

On the other hand, you have to look at immigrant's place within the economy, and where they are allowed in or excluded. If they are in large part excluded from the formal economy, they must then subsist in the informal or underground economy which, since unregulated, is prone to much more violent, property and drug-related crime. This could also account for the statistics. 

My point being, and this may not be counter to what you were trying to say (perhaps I am misinterpreting or generalizing), statistics do not become useless once several explanations arise for them. It is just as likely a theory that the high incarceration rates of Mexicans are caused by their greater involvement in criminal activity, as it is that the police are racially biased, and/or that undocumented immigrants find themselves subsisting within the informal, more crime-ridden economy. Statistics are just a piece of the picture - they are often the conclusion without the story in my opinion.",2,0,1443619612,1444718730

Either way definitely did NOT smash ALL economic theory considering so many economic theories do not rely on the rational agent - this is particular to neoclassical economics. And even within neoclassical economics they are drifting away from the 'rational agent' or at least distorting it (to fit the actual reality revealed by the social sciences) beyond recognition.",1,0,1443431914,1444718730
cvgauia,1,t3_3ml69c,HisNameIs,"Calling humans or human activity rational ends up being a petitio principii - you end up using ""rationality"" to describe both the premise and the conclusion (i'm not the best versed in logic, so please correct me if i'm using this wrong). Anyways, you can say that even when we don't use our full cognitive capacity, and use shortcuts as described by u/TychoCelchuuu and u/simism66, one could still say that it is ""rational"" to do so because it saves energy and the end result brings the greatest utility (or whatever your measurement is) of all options because you would spend more energy/resources finding the most logical or worthy or self-identifying action and end up with a lesser net utility than you would if you used some mental shortcut or prejudice or habit which would bring you less utility themselves but cost less energy/resources thus bringing you a greater net utility.

Essentially, the definition of ""rational"" can be expanded so much that everything can be explained as rational. I save someone else's child from a burning house and get 3rd degree burns - at the time it was rational because i did not think the chances of me getting such horrible burns and the consequences from that were worse than the good i would feel from saving a child, and I would still believe (whether a rationalization or not) that my actions were the right ones that brought me the greatest utility. ""Rationality"" ends up being the explanation for everything and thus means nothing. Petitio principii - someone acted rationally because they made rational decisions. Same argument goes for utility. Conventional economics is really flawed in this philosophical assumption. (side question, would this be considered an ontological assumption?)",2,0,1443394973,1444718730
cvfs8av,0,t1_cvfq1ft,HisNameIs,"I understand your point, but you say ""that's a negative to the UK and US"" but is it really? In what ways? We can't produce more things at a cheaper cost, to consumer more things? The overthrow doesn't seem to be to benefit the millions of lower or middle class Americans but to benefit the firms that will 1) control the oil, and 2) gain greater profit from cheaper oil. Now of course you can say whatever benefits these firms is beneficial to their workers and thus the rest of the economy. But in a 'large-scheme' perspective it was really just a power move - the US and UK want to control the resources of the world, like any empires/superpowers. To say the coup was in the best interest of all or even most Americans and British is easily debatable, especially considering the soldiers that have died as a result of a more religiously fundamental Iranian government. And from a humanity-scale perspective it certainly was horrible for many in Iran, especially women, who were torn from their secular, democratic government and placed under the rule of a totalitarian Islamic regime.

cvfo9i4,0,t1_cvflg1e,HisNameIs,"The ""we need to do this"" is just a rationalization backing up the notion that oil industry profits and oil itself are and should be one of the backbones of our economy. The people who benefited from keeping Iranian oil in the hands of US and UK firms are not the majority of Americans - but that is of course debatable. ",4,0,1443349971,1444718730

cvbfcm7,0,t1_cvb5rpf,HisNameIs,"It's about the moral corruption of those at the top of society; how we often strive to become those powerful, prestigious, yet corrupt individuals directing the rule of law; and a man trapped inside of this system, and his eventual revolt out of it as the leaders become too scared to keep the system in place and flee. However, he only ends up trapped in another system. 

Essentially we create these systems, communally (with some having more influence than others), and thus are trapping ourselves. 

I don't know if I got all of this across, but these were the ideas in my mind when I wrote this, and most of it was stream of consciousness, with some revisions for clarity of ideas and metaphor.

Definitely need to change the format, not quite sure how though...",1,0,1443022262,1444718730
