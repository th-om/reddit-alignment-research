The issue is that a game company worth hundreds of millions of dollars is on their 3rd AAA title and still can't release the (working/functional) game on time unless they break it up and release it over a quarter of a year.

I love Halo just as much as anybody else here, but this is bullshit. It's fair to call out bullshit.",-2,0,1444282031,1444721103

They are cutting features to meet a release date. Forge is completely cut out of the game until they release it.",-5,0,1444280340,1444721103
