cvt0x8w,1,t3_3o0oqh,punninglinguist,"I see this kind of stuff on undergraduate essay questions a lot. It happens, in my experience, under the following conditions.

1. The person is not a great writer, doesn't quite read at a college reading level.

2. He or she is pressured for time.

3. He or she knows that it's important to convey a certain message, and to sound like an educated person with mastery of the relevant terminology.

The result is usually that they try to jam as many of the important keywords into their answer as possible, along with plenty of ""smart-sounding"" phrases and words, and as a consequence of this high attentional load, they neglect the discourse and syntactic coherence that is usually a priority in writing or planned speech.

tldr: Like all humans, McCarthy has limited attentional resources to devote to speech planning. When speaking in these high-pressure situations, he's likely focusing those resources on other factors than syntactic and discourse coherence (e.g., monitoring his word choice, managing his tone of voice and/or nervous tics, maintaining a formal/educated speech register, etc.)",6,0,1444342860,1444720344
