cvuim67,1,t3_3o3mip,Ostridge93,"Please bear in mind that this is based solely on my personal opinion and is limited to albums I've actually heard from start to finish:

• Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon (1973)

• Alice in Chains - Jar of Flies (1993)

• Nine Inch Nails - The Downward Spiral (1994)

• Radiohead - Kid A (2000)

I interpret 10/10 as meaning that I can listen to the entire album without getting bored or skipping any tracks, regardless of what mood I'm in at the time. This is not even a remotely complete list of all my favourite albums.",1,0,1444451272,1444726360
cvudo7d,0,t1_cvud2jn,Ostridge93,"We don't have a contract of any sort in place. Technically it's not even a legal tenancy; she rents the place out to us, but she is legally our roommate and the owner of the house. She currently lives with her boyfriend.

I've asked her why she doesn't want him inside the house, and she basically told me that she doesn't trust him, and that ""it's personal"".",1,0,1444440200,1444726360
cvucrde,0,t1_cvuclgi,Ostridge93,"No. My mother is the landlord, I'm the tenant, and the person in question is my father. She forbids him from entering the house without her consent.",2,0,1444438383,1444726360
cvsb67u,0,t1_cvsagxf,Ostridge93,"I suppose you have a point there. And maybe I shouldn't worry so much about it in the first place - if things go awry, it's not like it'll have any impact on me in the real world.",3,0,1444296572,1444726360
cvsackx,0,t1_cvsa0cs,Ostridge93,"I don't think I overstated her interest in me - in fact, I don't think she was really all that interested in me in the first place. I just wanted to know why people suddenly change their minds about wanting to talk to someone.

I've always suspected that I must be a poor conversationist. On the other hand, if I do any of the things you've suggested, I might come across as being too forward. That's why I like to take things slow and keep conversations a little simple at the start.",2,0,1444292820,1444726360

Is it verging on harassment at this point?",1,0,1444199258,1444726360
