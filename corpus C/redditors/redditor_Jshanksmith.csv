So, if I am building a giant bomb in my garage, or if I had deadly viruses stored in my home, you as my neighbor, do not have a reasonable fear, until I blow something up, or let the virus out...? I understand these examples are not necessarily 'protected rights' but the logic you used to justify gun rights as not infringing on my liberty is the same. Shit, if you are my neighbor and I am always sitting at my window, pointing my rifle at passerbys, as a neighbor having a gun pointed at you, ought that not be illegal? I have to shoot you before it is a threat? BTW - I have no real strong opinion either way (with gun laws), just can't stand the INSANITY of many pro gun arguments.  ",1,1,1444701829,1444717842

The constitution, also, clearly states that it is the role of the govt to promote the general welfare. Often, our rights, which may be equally important, conflict with one another, i.e. liberty & equality etc...

cvx2ih5,1,t3_3nlle9,Jshanksmith,"Politically, it might be a good idea. This is because of one simple fact; the people who are pro-gun, are 100 times more passionate/politically active in the matter, than people who support gun regulation.  ",1,0,1444668603,1444717842
cvwxlz8,0,t1_cvwlis0,Jshanksmith,"Here is the simple fallacy with speech = money... Fed Govt, has insane amount of power and authority to regulate money (Art. II, Sect. 8). Not so much with speech (limited, most authority over speech lies in time, place, manner, regulations). What money in politics really furthers, is the platform/soapbox, from which one speaks. So, the gov't could regulate the way ppl use their money without violating speech. Citizen's United was a decision derived from judicial activism, and is supposed to be 'narrow' in its ruling.

TL;DR - Money = Speech is a gross, and irrational, conclusion wrongfully reached by a politically motivated court.  ",1,0,1444660526,1444717842
cvwx8nb,0,t1_cvw7rbb,Jshanksmith,"Corporations have become 'persons,' through an evolution of corporate law. Originally, corporations did not resemble corps of today. imited charters were the first type of 'corp'. They were limited in function, lifespan, and ownership. Corps also, had no real 'personhood' benefits at that time. Smart corporate attorneys have grown the personhood of corps continually, since the conception of the USA. The introduction of the 14th Amend. (obviously, meant for  protecting minorities) opened the flood gates for corporate interests to gain protection under the 14th (check out Santa Clara V South Pacific Rail...). Citizen's United is just the latest in a long history of special interests lobbying govt, and growing corporate personhood.   

TL;DR - Corporations are 'legal persons', precisely because special interests have created them and furthered a corporation's recognition and protection. ",1,0,1444659835,1444717842
