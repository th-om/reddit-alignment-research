I always fight my way out of it if I dont fall asleep immediately, and I've gotten pretty good about it, but it usually takes me five or so minutes to completely come out of it.",0,0,1444363363,1444727370

cvt0h2x,0,t1_cvsz4ib,LAULitics,"I'm more concerned about the elevated pollution than I am about the noise. I don't particularly care about the noise, I've owned a bunch of loud cars. I personally try to keep my exhausts quiet now so as to not draw attention, but I can appreciate a nice sounding exhaust. ",0,0,1444342126,1444727370
cvsmct6,1,t3_3nx30f,LAULitics,"Not my preference in terms of comedic style, as I prefer really dark, morbid, and dirty humor with plenty of swearing. But credit where it's due, Regan is a really nice guy, and does what his clean take on comedy very well.",0,0,1444321417,1444727370
cvskr14,1,t3_3nyuoz,LAULitics,"*I think the FR-S should have come with a high revving inline four, instead of the boxer motor to keep the character of car more in line with spirit of the original AE86.

*I think the modern Lexus brand styling is hideous. And I wish car manufacturers in general, would stop using giant gaping crome lined holes as primary styling features.

*The S2000s interior, while elegant in its simplicity and functionality, is hilariously cramped. Even more so than a first gen Miata.

*The Tesla Model S, while an awesome exercise in engineering, really deserves a much more luxurious interior given its price.

*The Lotus Evora should have been better than it was. How do you end up with an unreliable car using a Toyta Camry drivetrain?

*The Toyota FT-1 is great looking, except for the nose; which looks like it was lifted straight from the face of Gonzo the muppet.

*I prefer manual accessories like windows, because they're more reliable, easier to fix, and cheaper to repair when something inevitably breaks.

*Throttle by wire still does not feel as good or responsive as a physical throttle cable. 

*Mass is the biggest enemy of any car, truck, or van in production, and manufactuers should use every and all available means to reduce it wherever possible. The newest F-150 is a good example. Ford shaved almost half a ton of weight from it's latest version of the truck by switching to aluminum in the vehicles body and chassis.

*If you run around on public roads in a modified car with a test pipe instead of a high flow catalytic converter, you are an asshole.

*Giant rims with narrow sidewall tires on production cars is a stupid trend, and it will result in rim damage over rough surfaces. Putting even bigger rims on big body sedans and old American cars is even more stupid. Unsprung mass is a real thing, and putting gigantic heavy wheels on a car makes it handle, ride and brake like shit, compared to how it would otherwise perform with a lighter wheel and tire combination. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsprung_mass

*Also, I see a lot of occasional hate in this sub for modified cars, in which people claim that modifying a car will ruin it and decrease it's value. I don't think this is true. So long as you don't do anything drastic to dramatically increase an engines power output, and subsequently wear out your internals; the vast majority of basic bolt on modifications can be undone, and stock parts can be reinstalled when it comes time to sell the car. Modifying your car yourself, is a fun way to get to know your car better; and doing the labor yourself, after you've researched the topic thoroughly can be very rewarding when you get to feel the changes you made to your car.",8,0,1444319061,1444727370
