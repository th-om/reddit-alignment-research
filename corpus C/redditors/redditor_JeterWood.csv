cvu80g1,0,t1_cvu675e,JeterWood,Traffic lights are immoral.  Where does the Government get the right to tell me when I can move?  Individuals are born with the moral right of freedom of movement and the Government is trying to take that away.  The Government will use the threat of violence to prevent us from exercising our freedom of movement.  Traffic lights are therefore a form of slavery.,3,0,1444429437,1444719993

cvu4vxa,0,t1_cvu4hgp,JeterWood,"Generally speaking, it makes more sense for a company to have you on as a salaried employee if they need you at least 40 hours a week.  That way, when there is a lot of work to get done they can ask you to work a little extra and not pay you more.  It is better for the company to have you as hourly if they plan to cut your hours when business is slow.

In San Fran / Oakland, you'll be able to rent a 1 bedroom apt for $1500 a month.  If it is in San Jose / Palo Alto area, then it will be ~$2000 a month.  Good Luck!",1,0,1444424239,1444719993
cvu3xmn,1,t3_3o54j3,JeterWood,"Is the job salaried or hourly?  If it is hourly, are you guaranteed at least 40 hours a week?  If so, your salary will be ~$94,000 a year.  CA has higher taxes as well, so maybe you'll take home $64,000 a year.  That is ~$5200 / month.  Rent will start out at $1500 / month.  Other living expenses will probably be ~$2000 / month.  

It is a nice pay raise, but probably not as much as you think.",2,0,1444422698,1444719993

1, The McCarthy affair is just a rumor - I've never seen any proof or admission of wrong doing.  There are many rumors in Washington that have no basis in reality.
2, I believe Boehner when he said he originally wanted to step down last cycle but didn't because of the Cantor debacle.

I think Boehner is ready to leave Congress.  He has a job that is way less stressful and pays way more just waiting for him.  He clearly doesn't like being Speaker (it's a job no one wants) and is ready to wash his hands of Congress and walk into the sunset.",2,0,1444419867,1444719993
cvtzgnx,0,t1_cvtymoi,JeterWood,"From my standpoint I think the US government does a good job of appropriately promoting public health.  Not perfect, but good.  How much power the government has in doing so depends.  What is the threat?  What is the benefit?  What are the unintended consequences?  These things are nuanced and need to be studied on a case by case basis.  A one-size-fits-all extreme concrete approach to all matters of public health is not good policy.


>If you're going to equate cost with freedom, shouldn't you do that for everything?

It depends on what that thing is.  The freedom gained through basic needs and services (shelter, food, education, healthcare) is not on the same footing as freedoms gained though vices and luxury items (cigarettes, booze, yachts, jewelry).  A public policy that makes cigarettes less affordable is not comparable to a public policy that makes education less affordable.",-1,0,1444415973,1444719993

cvtwqe8,0,t1_cvtvhr2,JeterWood,"A cigarette tax is a world away from the criminal penalties associated with marijuana.  Criminal penalties certainly are a punishment, but taxes are not.  Are income taxes a ""punishment"" for making an income?  Of course not.

One of the fundamental roles of government is public health (i.e. ""Promote the general welfare"").  Cigarette taxes and warning labels have been associated with a decline in cigarette use, so it looks like that policy is working.  Alcohol already has an extra tax levied on it as well as a warning label.  Does junk food and soda pose an equitable threat to public health?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Some people certainly think so.  The topic should be studied further.  If it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it is so, then treating junk food and soda like cigarettes and alcohol might be appropriate.  The answer is never to ban something and create a black market - that just makes things worse.

Maybe the answer to heart disease has more to do with exercise.  What if the government have tax breaks and subsidies to gym memberships?  Would that be limiting personal choice?  I don't think so.",-2,0,1444411908,1444719993
