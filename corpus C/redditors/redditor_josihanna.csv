cvftyvl,0,t1_cvfjld0,josihanna,It definitely does. It's inevitable to end up with some of the traits of it if raised by someone with the disorder. ,1,0,1443367759,1444731204
cvfib89,0,t1_cvfhn3c,josihanna,"One thing my therapist told me when I said how terrified I am of turning into my dad (I notice his shitty personality traits in myself all the time): ""You were raised by a narcissist and because of that you carry some narcissistic traits. Just the fact that you're worried about being one means that you're not."" Made me feel so much better.",22,0,1443328010,1444731204
cvfhk3s,0,t1_cvfgd1w,josihanna,"This doesn't necessarily mean you're a socio/psychopath. I bet any psychologist would love to help you out. Some of these things are normal depending on your childhood situation... my sister can mold her personality to fit anyone's bill (I did too, for a long time) and it's really just a defense mechanism against her insecurities.

Idk man, please don't assume you're a psychopath without talking to a professional about it. It's likely that you're not!",29,0,1443326258,1444731204

He loves you so damn much, man",8,0,1443223952,1444731204

And heroin overdoses. Lots of heroin overdoses. Like, there's at least five each year. ",1,0,1443209131,1444731204

cvcuhyh,1,t3_3m8650,josihanna,"1. Your ability and talent in capturing the beauty of nature in your music is impeccable. You so cleanly blend classical and natural music/sounds, it's like you were made to make this music.
2. In one of your songs there's a sample at the end which says, ""When the baby grows up to be an old man and he dies, his soul goes to Heaven."" IMO this is one of your most powerful songs and never fails to give me chills. Does using that sample point towards a certain spirituality?
3. Your music makes me feel things that I don't always wish to feel, but in the best possible way. It is the most powerful music I've ever heard... It's my daily therapy. Thank you for keeping me sane on my sad days and for keeping me grounded. I've been moved to tears each time I've seen you live.",1,0,1443119694,1444731204
