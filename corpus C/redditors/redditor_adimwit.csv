cvow805,1,t3_3nhq12,adimwit,"Also, the term ""dictator"" was a title and political position. They were used in times of war or crisis and, I believe, were usually men of respect and honor. When the crisis was over, they gave up power.

In recent times, Mussolini used the term to describe his position as Duce and he considered his position similar in that Italy was in a crisis (the Great Depression) and he would give it up when it was over. When Italy was invaded, the Fascist Grand Council voted to return power to the King, and Mussolini accepted.",1,0,1444053414,1444729324
cv9vj0r,0,t1_cv91uxz,adimwit,"In Italy, Germany, and Spain, the term ""corporation"" had a much broader meaning. Here in the US, it's a legal term for incorporated businesses but in a Fascist system a corporation was a confederation of labor unions and capitalists.

Part of the reason the Fascists suppressed parliamentary democracy was based on the belief that it inevitably led to the fusion of business interests and government power.",2,0,1442896029,1444729324
cv9v8gp,0,t1_cv92mi8,adimwit,"The development of myths in a Fascist system are not necessarily religious. The purpose of myths was to unite the people in any cause, a cause which is not necessarily reachable. This theory of using myths was developed by Georges Sorel who was a French socialist. He believed that a socialist utopia was the myth which unified the workers of the world. Mussolini applied the same idea but with national greatness in place of socialist utopia.

In the U.S. there really is no unifying myth. We do see various myths developed that will unify parties but no singular myth that unifies the nation.",1,0,1442895360,1444729324
cv13f75,0,t1_cv11o3q,adimwit,"Hitler hated unions, but he didn't create the corporatist system in Germany. The Social-Democrats did. When he came to power he drastically altered the system, smashing communist unions but building state unions reserved for Aryans.

Mussolini was different. He was a former Marxist, and the Fascist movement were largely working class military veterans who were sympathetic to socialism. This was because during WWI, the military drafted a ton of urban workers to fight. After the war, when the socialist movement split, tons more workers flocked to fascism. The notorious beatings and union smashing we see from Italian fascism was due largely to the agrarian Fascists who were simply hired thugs for the landowners. The urban Fascists were workers who were largely sympathetic to socialism. When the Fascists took power in Italy, they had union leaders, socialists and even Marxists working in the government.",1,0,1442236697,1444729324
cv0o6z6,0,t1_cv0o02h,adimwit,Exactly. Mussolini said over and over that you can't have Fascism without corporatism. Which makes that whole 14 points list totally irrelevant.,2,0,1442193682,1444729324
cv0n8vo,1,t3_3ku6i0,adimwit,"This isn't fascism. There are relatively few people who could be defined as such because fascism is also an economic system rather than just nationalist rhetoric.

Fascism was a system where labor unions and managerial associations (the capitalists) had power to manage major industries with state oversight. Literally no one advocates this in the U.S.",1,0,1442192046,1444729324

cuamrsk,1,t3_3hnt5s,adimwit,"The corporations are defined differently in a fascist state. In the U.S., a corporation is a legal term relating to incorporated businesses. In a Fascist state, a corporation was a confederation of labor unions and managerial associations. Meaning a corporation was managed by workers and capitalists. Such an institution doesn't really exist in the U.S.

A better term for a fascist-style corporate state is probably guild state.",1,0,1440164616,1444729324
cu85t25,0,t1_cu7ryli,adimwit,"It's a source. Frances Perkins was one of FDR's Braintrusters and in her biography (I think) she talks about how, early on, she was quite disturbed by Hugh S. Johnson's affinity for fascism and he readily distributed books amongst the Braintrusters on Mussolini's corporate state. Despite this, they all agreed to implement his ideas and HSJ was also granted administration over the National Recovery Administration. HSJ also demanded control of the WPA but they refused, fearing that would give him too much power.",4,0,1439986558,1444729324
cu85l6m,0,t1_cu82mk5,adimwit,"The Business Plot is a bit convoluted. **It did happen**, but the details are sketchy. The testimony makes it pretty clear that the plotters supported the establishment of paramilitary veterans organizations but past that we don't know what the exact plan was.

Butler's testimony says the man expected to replace FDR was Hugh S. Johnson, who was a Braintruster and a key architect of the first phase of the New Deal. Johnson himself made it pretty clear he was greatly influenced by Fascism and the first New Deal shows that. FDR fired Johnson because he botched the NRA, which was later completely scrapped when it was ruled unconstitutional.

It doesn't quite make sense that the plotters wanted to oust FDR for a man who basically built the New Deal from the ground up. It also doesn't make sense that the man they chose to lead the veterans organization was a quaker and vocally anti-capitalist. Moreover, Smedley Butler was well-loved and had great influence among the veterans.

In short, the bankers behind the plot basically created a coup led by an anti-capitalist and a New Dealer. It makes no sense.",15,0,1439985960,1444729324
