cvrzgba,0,t1_cvrltiz,FuriousGeorge06,"People look down on people who reveal they have a high IQ because there is almost no context in which making such a statement is useful or helpful for anyone other than the person saying it.

If you are smart, people will typically pick up on it. If you're smart and say, ""I have an IQ of 150,"" people will find you arrogant because your intelligence was already obvious. Stating your IQ was unnecessary and serves only to differentiate you from the people you're talking to.

Conversely, if you are not smart and say, ""I have an IQ of 150,"" people will not believe you because you have not contributed to conversations or collaborations in a constructive, intelligent way that reflects such a high IQ. In this case, people will think you're either extremely insecure or an idiot.

It's not that being highly intelligent is a sign of arrogance, it's that bringing attention to that intelligence for no reason is a sign of arrogance.",1,0,1444266628,1444723903

cvn6hqm,0,t1_cvmuzmd,FuriousGeorge06,"but there are so many more jobs than just assembly plants. The US manufacturers buy more American-made parts, employ several times more American engineers, and have a much larger economic footprint in this country than any of the foreign manufacturers.",2,0,1443910965,1444723903
cvn6fmx,0,t1_cvmq2c5,FuriousGeorge06,"I'm sorry, but this is simply not true. It's correct that if we only look at parts, you'll see a great deal of variation. But even when looking at this from strictly a ""where is it built"" perspective, the American companies produce more vehicles in the United States and purchase substantially more domestically produced parts.

The real flaw in this argument, however, is that it completely ignores the reality of employment numbers. If your objective is to support U.S. jobs, Ford, GM, or Chrysler will get you a lot more bang for your buck.

General Motors alone employs more Americans than Toyota and Honda combined. ",0,0,1443910854,1444723903
cvn63e3,0,t1_cvmrcm4,FuriousGeorge06,"This is very true, but the foreign makers still have FAR fewer engineers in the US than the American auto makers do. 

""The Center for Automotive Research said the Big Three had 24,000 engineers on U.S. payrolls in 2007. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said its member companies had 3,500 U.S. research and development employees in 2007.""
