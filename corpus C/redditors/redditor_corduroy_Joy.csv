It's not so much that I think the kind of on-the-job, real-life training and experience she must have received while working as an actress for Fox was inferior to the education she would have received in a secondary school. In fact, measured by its own standard (training in show business and acting; I can only assume Williams was a fantastic mentor as well), it is probably of a higher caliber than anything else that was available to her at the time. 

But that said, her work experience is very different from what secondary education curriculum is intended to provide. Learning about history, science, math, the humanities throughout one's teenage years has a very particular lifelong, and in my opinion, under-appreciated impact on a person. Throughout those formative years, teenagers don't necessarily learn much that will directly pertain to their future careers, but much will be indirectly relevant, and still more will benefit them personally, helping them confront issues of meaning (like, what's a lunar eclipse? or what distinguishes satire from parody?) and what they want for their future ('pol science is exciting, but I think economics is where the real action happens' etc.). 

I realize that a lot of people suffer through their high school experience, and we should do everything we can to prevent that. But I worry about the inference 'X is an extremely valuable, once in a life-time experience, therefore it must be worth missing a major chunk of one's progression through secondary education for.' I think this misses the invaluability of education throughout these years. To use an analogy, training with a former sports hero might be an extraordinary experience, but it arguably wouldn't be worth sacrificing the very ordinary experience of seeing your children grow up. I think one's high school education, when it's working as it should, is just that kind of very ordinary yet irreplaceable keystones of a modern life.

cvfmcbc,0,t1_cvfj2yf,corduroy_Joy,"I'd probably agree that this is ultimately a counter-productive policy, but it's not at all unreasonable to go to great lengths to discourage chronic absenteeism. There are many studies that show this to be uniquely destructive to a child's educational outcomes. 

Mrs. Doubtfire was an awesome movie, and I thought the child actors did fantastic jobs, but their parents had no right to disrupt their education for that opportunity, regardless how much money it yielded or how many of us were touched by their performances.   ",0,0,1443340680,1444732286

Was this dog about to eat its owner's face? Sure, it's doubtful, though I hear that dogs don't wait long to chow down. OP seemed interested in why a dog might start licking a dying owner's face, and this is one hilarious reason. ",1,0,1442174161,1444732286

That's because members of the executive are able to apply for what's called a [certificate of investiture](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1043) IRC ยง1043), which enables them to sell those assets that could cause a conflict of interest without paying taxes on them. 

This feature of the tax code was mentioned once during Romney's campaign (see the last section of this [CNN Money article](http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/01/news/economy/romney_fortune/)), but for some reason no one is talking about in regards to Trump, though the tax-savings would be astronomical for him, perhaps billions.
