cvx0m1x,0,t1_cvx0ii6,THETEH,The European leisure and tourism sections should look different in the next patch I hope! You're right that hotels like that are only found in certain cities and more variety in the aesthetic would be more realistic. ,1,0,1444665617,1444723752
cvx0a2f,0,t1_cvww3t0,THETEH,"Locking buildings to roads makes sense to me.  I can't think of that many train stations IRL that aren't connected to road networks, can you?

Edit - some good points in the replies to this comment about how train stations could snap to tracks instead of roads. ",-2,0,1444665087,1444723752
cvx08rq,0,t1_cvwylzb,THETEH,"SC4 had a good simulation too IMO, I always felt as if my cities were genuinely responding to my choices (strikes etc.) and that the game was a pretty good balance of challenge and fun (though sort of like C:S it was hardest at the start of a new city and became really easy once you had big cities especially with region play where a big city nearby meant starting with huge demand for everything)",4,0,1444665030,1444723752
cvx06gv,0,t1_cvwuxwn,THETEH,Regarding traffic AI - a fix for landships would be great - it's just an aesthetic glitch so it's maybe not as important as gameplay changes *but* it still really breaks immersion to suddenly have a boat sliding on land through your nice new residential area.,4,0,1444664926,1444723752
cvx03yo,0,t1_cvwvv6h,THETEH,"> Too big hotels, too Las Vegas

I disagree with this one - when I think of leisure and tourism-oriented places I generally do think of Vegas-esque places.  Although I agree with what others have mentioned about how low-density leisure and tourism should look different. 

I could also imagine a new policy where you could choose to ban gambling or loud nightclubs, and your leisure and tourist areas would instead fill with more ""family-friendly"" things like motels, minigolf, shopping, little carnivals/theme parks, concert venues and theaters, skating rinks, and that sort of thing.",8,0,1444664818,1444723752
cvwzya1,0,t1_cvwwi07,THETEH,"This is a bigger issue for me compared to the traffic honestly.  Having a ""rush hour"" would be interesting but might also be a huge hassle as a player.  But if we have different sliders for day and night it would be nice to have a reason to use them, otherwise it feels like a fairly shallow attempt to make it seem like there's more of a difference between day & night then there actually is.",7,0,1444664561,1444723752
cvww8pq,0,t1_cvwv377,THETEH,"It sometimes surprises me how perfectionist and demanding gamers have become. Not sure there's any modern game that many are 100% satisfied with - and any problem is treated as if it makes a game unplayable.

Not saying that it's bad to critique games but if people are nit picky about every single detail any legitimate feedback gets lost in a sea of whining about roads not looking completely accurate.

I think you're right that it's good to have perspective about this sort of thing. ",5,0,1444657805,1444723752
cvww5lp,0,t1_cvws64n,THETEH,"""Landship warning"" ha. I saw my first landships in a long time while playing last night. Surprised that issue hasn't been patched yet. ",1,0,1444657618,1444723752
cvww3ct,1,t3_3og2d9,THETEH,"I'll try to actually make this one thing rather than a big list which is what others are doing. 

For AD specifically my biggest problem is that having separate budget sliders for day and night seems pointless because apart from crime there doesn't seem to be anything that actually changes at night - people in school all through the night etc. Adding separate sliders for day and night I think made people expect there to be more changing within the simulation as day transitions to night. 

So my biggest issue would be a desire for more complexity as the day and night cycle progresses. Perhaps an optional ability to toggle the day/night cycle length back to 1H at max speed (to match the actual length of a cim's day if I remember right)? ",1,0,1444657489,1444723752
