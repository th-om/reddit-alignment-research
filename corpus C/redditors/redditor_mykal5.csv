>Hey nitromethane is for sale on Amazon, and you can buy ammonia nitrate at the hardware store. It's not hard to build a bomb.

Democrats are led by a very important philosophy that says we're are joined by our similarities and strengthened by our differences.  Within our party there is a strong appreciation of diversity.

Democrats do not believe government can solve all problems if any, rather we believe government can be a very useful tool in the pursuit of a better world.

What amazes me is how each and every one of his supporters view his antisocial acts in isolation rather than what should be clear to any and all clear headed individuals; a pattern of seriously troubling behavior.
