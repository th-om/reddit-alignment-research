cvvman7,0,t1_cvvl07a,freef,I feel like it matters less now if luffy fights someone. The fights in dressrosa were all fairly fast compared to pre-time skip fights and a lot of the tension now comes from snowballing political situations involving the upset balance of power in the new world. So now even if luffy runs into kaido and fight him the point will be about that fights impact on what these powerful figures are doing. A fight now would be super fun and would almost certainly not play to its conclusion. ,4,0,1444547695,1444724266

If he is serious about overtaking Hillary then it's wiser to make domestic issues the focus of the primary since those are where he really shines and where he is so good at connecting with people.

I'm also hoping the final crew member will be momo, to serve as the shanks (or buggy) to luffy's Roger. ",2,0,1444319168,1444724266
