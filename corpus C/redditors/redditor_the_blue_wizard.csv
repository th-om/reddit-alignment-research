In know of one made in England by Beresford -

But this is similar to what you need. Using Speaker Level Switching, the Beresford TC-7220 can switch one of two amps, or one of two speakers.

cvxuxjv,1,t3_3ojq52,the_blue_wizard,"People who are not involved in guns, have no idea what is going on. 

This news was just released recently. *What is the Second most popular competitive High School Sport in Minnesota?* Answer: Skeet/Trap (shotgun) shooting. More than 6 millions rounds fired without a single accident or incident. 

The Boy Scouts teach firearms safety, which includes actually shooting guns. 

Many high schools do have firearms safety. 

Many summer camps have firearms safety programs. 

But you can't have some ham-fisted half-brained clod teaching these classes. You need a certified firearms safety instructor. 

But yes, for those interested, and those mature enough to treat it seriously, certainly there is nothing wrong with teaching firearms safety.

Is the Subwoofer covered or is the ventilation in any way interfered with? 

Have you check the integrity of all the connections and cables? Perhaps intense vibrations is causing a bad wire or bad connection to be a problem.

cvxtthn,1,t3_3oj8d6,the_blue_wizard,"I'm guessing these are home made (DIY) speakers from the look of them.

What kind of money are we talking about here for this project?

Finding speaker is no problem, but, unless you want to rebuild the Front Baffle, you will need speakers of the same size. So, what size are the speakers. There is nothing in the Photo to give us any perspective. 

Can you measure the Diameter of the holes?

I actually don't see a Tweeter. I looks to me like two woofers and a midrange. 

Again, depending on how much you want to spend and how far you want to take it, certainly these cabinets could be used for other drivers. But we have far too few details to actually make recommendations. 

Woofers -

Tweeters -

Dozens and dozens of all styles and shapes to choose from. 

Many of the bass driver/woofers has a calculation already made for the optimize Ported Cabinet, and the optimum Sealed Cabinet. Take a look at those specs. 

The internal volume of the cabinet is about 2.63 Cubic Feet. But you need to make a best guess as to the volume of the drivers in the cabinet and subtract that from the overall volume. Knowing this, you can tune the cabinet Bass Reflex Port to any frequency you want. Typically that frequency is roughly the resonance *(fs)* of the bass drivers.

There are many other considerations, but I'll leave that until we have more information.",1,0,1444710911,1444718832

cvxpbhb,1,t3_3og4fc,the_blue_wizard,"**Cooties (2014)** - Elijah Wood, Rainn Wilson - This is something of a spoof on horror movies, but despite being silly, it does stand up as a horror movie. Very enjoyable if you don't take it too serious. 

**SPY (2015)** - Melissa McCarthy - Both funny and action packed. This movie could have been a disaster, but I think they played it smart, and took the high road. As a result, you have a very fun entertaining movie. 

**Get Real - (1998)** - Ben Silverstone, Brad Gorton - A movie about two British school boys falling in love, and the problems it causes for them. I saw this movie years ago on VHS, I had forgotten how good the movie is. Really a charming story with charming characters, and unlike some older Gay Movies, not a total tragic downer. Actually somewhat uplifting. 

**The Lost Medallion: The Adventure of Billy Stone - (2013) -** Slightly Gody, with the typical depth of a Disney-esque movie aimed at 10 year olds. The story of a lost medallion that has the power to grant wishes to the true of heart. The Gody part is a bit over the top, but the central movies is actually pretty good for light family fair. Though I confess, I watch the movie again just to see how ripped young Billy Unger's body was. 

Actor Billy Unger has done a lot of growing up in only few short years.

Though I suspect *""The Lost Medallion""* was shot years before it was released. 

**A Brilliant Young Mind (2015) -** Asa Butterfield - *In the Theater* - A charming character drama with charming characters. Though a part of me wishes for more depth. The story of a mildly Autistic Math Genius who makes the International Math Olympics. The trials for which are held in Taiwan. A long journey for an emotionally stunted boy. Ultimately he has to make a choice between being dutifully obedient, and perusing what really matters in life. Being a slow burn character drama, there really aren't high points and low point, more so, a slice of life. I did enjoy the movie, and it is good to see Asa Butterfield developing as an actor. 

**If I Had Wings (2013)** - Richard Harmon, Jaren Brandt Bartlett - The story of a blind teenage boy determined to find a way to run competitive cross country. With the help of a local juvenile delinquent, he works toward his goal. Watched for the second time. Not high production values, but a good story, well worth watching. 

That's all I can think of for now. ",2,0,1444702997,1444718832

At the crazy suggested retail price of $400. 

Logically, you should be able to pair these with any Bluetooth Transmitter enabled devise like a Smart Pad/Tablet, Smart Phone, or Bluetooth enabled Computer. 

Bluetooth is good, sort of, for wireless music, but it doesn't beat wired or hard copy music.

So, what will you be playing? That is MP3? FLAC? WAV? Other? 

If you are playing MP3, it doesn't matter much, wireless will sound as good as wired. 

If you are playing FLAC, likely Bluetooth will sound fine, but not quite as fine as a good stereo system.

To my knowledge there are no Bluetooth Players, there are only devices that are Bluetooth enabled, like Laptops, and devices that can be Bluetooth Enabled. 

If you have a computer, and one assumes that you do, then you can get a **USB Bluetooth TRANSMITTER** in the roughly $10 to $25 range. ",1,0,1444699523,1444718832
