His public persona was a complete lie, and that invalidates and makes his creative material repulsive when looked at again.",3,0,1444511440,1444722749

cvub55y,1,t3_3o5eey,taksark,"Short answer: Not in most cases, but due to unique reasons this is different. 

I think that Bill Cosby is a special case. He was seen as a wholesome and kind family man. But was revealed to be anything but. His topic matter was seen as relatable, honest, and family friendly material. After the world learned about what he did, I don't believe that we can view his works in an honest light anymore, as they didn't showcase a true reflection of his character. 

There's other people out there who have obvious flaws. **I know** that these people I'm going to mention haven't done things at as bad of a magnitude as Bill Cosby, but off the top of my head I can think of three people who I admire the works of and not the personality of; Kanye West, Steve Jobs, and Adrian Peterson (I know he committed a terrible crime, but it wasn't repeated and over many years like Cosby's case if I remember correctly). 

I use their inventions, I listen to their music, and I cheer for their team. Although they aren't model citizens, I still appreciate their work. But like I said, they didn't do anything as bad or as prolonged as Bill Cosby.

In Bill Cosby's case however, that isn't the case. Like I said earlier, his work was based off of the assumption that he was a model citizen. Combine that with the heinousness and magnitude of his crimes, and it becomes hard to enjoy his work.
