In the 1950s, the RAND corporation did a study on this concept. When Congress found out they threatened to cut funding. They passed a law making it prohibited for federal funds to be used to study the possibility of surrender of the US military under any circumstances.

All gun owners should be required to serve in a militia program one week every two years, or over the course of two or three weekends in the summer. The militia should be designated by districts (for instance on a county level), certified by a statewide body, and be locally governed by an elected board similar to school boards. No non-public militias should be allowed. (No private or charter militias).

The program should consist in training on gun safety, marksmanship, tactics, cleaning and maintenance, and proper storage. In addition, there should be classes in citizenship, CPR and First Aid, ethics, and law.

A license and insurance should be required. The issuance of the license should be under the authority of the local militia board, and require a written test, and a vision test. The license fee funds should be administered by the militia board. If a person wishes to own a gun and serve in the militia, but cannot afford to, the state should offer grants and a waiver of the fee.

The introduction of new models of firearms by gun manufacturers should be very heavily regulated so as to require limitations on firepower. In no case shall any firearm be prohibited from use by a civilian that is permitted for use by local law enforcement, and vice versa.

With the implementation of these requirements, many of the existing restrictions on the time, place and manner of carrying of firearms should be greatly relaxed. This is with the understanding that militia members are obligated to act in their capacity as a defense of innocent civilians in the event of a clear and present threat of violence.",1,0,1444128099,1444721873
