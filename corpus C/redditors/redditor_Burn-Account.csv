My mom works with homeless veterans. You did what was right. Nobody should be forced to fight in a war they don't believe in. 

One of her coworkers is a man who served in Vietnam, and the way soldiers were treated back then is a crime. This is a man who signed up for it, went to Nam, and ended up jumping on a grenade to save his friends. Ended up thinking he was dead with shrapnel sticking out of his head. He was given the basic medical assistance to keep him alive, but when he asked about follow up care, he was told to talk to his nonexistent insurence company when he got back to the states.

My point is, of all the outcomes possible, you chose one that kept you alive without significant brain damage. The stories my mom tells me about vets from 'Nam and the bullshit they went through is heartbreaking. Soldiers were just numbers back tnen, I would hope it has improved since, but I have no clue. I had one rule when I was growing up in regards to my future plans: I wasn't allowed to ever consider joining the armed forces.",6,0,1444609316,1444717782

Or, alternatively, if people actually learn about nationalized healthcare and keep electing democratic presidents. Which would suggest it becoming more popular.",3,0,1444438146,1444717782
