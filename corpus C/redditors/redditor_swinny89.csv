cvxqoiv,1,t3_3oi8wa,swinny89,"Nope, you're right. That's pretty much it. The most accessible lagitamate thing is drug markets. What specifically were you looking for? Secret discussions happen between parties who trust eachother via encrypted emails. What did you hope to find? If what you were looking for is actually a good idea, it probably does exist. If not, it probably doesn't exist. In the very unlikely case that what you are looking for is a good idea and it doesn't exist, make it. Good ideas should exist.",2,0,1444705159,1444731898
cvx116k,0,t1_cvx067m,swinny89,"I understand what you are saying, but I am not sure it is true. What factors are you taking into account to calculate the actions benefit? Or is this based purely on speculation? I'll be honest, I'm just speculating, but at the face of it, I am not convinced that the payout for being altruistic is greater than the payout for not being altruistic in this particular case. I'm sure there are miners who would agree with you, and there are miners who agree with me. Untill some data is presented which suggests one way or the other, your claim that altruism is benificial to the individual in this case might be true, or it might not.",1,0,1444666298,1444731898

A counter is necessary, unless you have no counter, in which case, I think you should rethink your points, as they don't address what I wrote. Communal altruism only works if there is some mechinism of accountability. In this case, there is no accountability. The actions of the community does not depend on whether or not I am altruistic in this particular situation. In the case that the community is altruistic, I don't personally benifit from being altruistic. In the case that the community is not altruistic, I still don't benifit by being altruistic.",1,0,1444664462,1444731898
cvwyb7p,0,t1_cvwv3uk,swinny89,"I completely agree, but no acts take place which don't have a selfish bearing. Some also have an altruistic bearing, but not all. The point is that we can't rest purly on altruism. That doesn't work. What we need to do is make the selfish things we do also altruistic.

Writing posts on reddit fulfills entertainment needs, as well as refines my thought abilities, which makes me feel good about myself. Various selfish motives causes me to do the things I do. I realize that altruism is benificial in the long run, so I try to do the most altruistic things that I enjoy.",1,0,1444661786,1444731898

cvwuu9h,0,t1_cvwtu2d,swinny89,"No, the long term gain or loss has no direct connection to the individual act of altruism. It is directly connected to the communities cooperative altruism, which is out of the individuals hands. In the case that everyone is altruistic, it is most benificial for me to not be altruistic. And if everyone is not altruistic, it is still most benificial for me to not be altruistic.",1,0,1444654471,1444731898
