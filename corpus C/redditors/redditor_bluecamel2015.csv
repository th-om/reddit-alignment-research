cvxu2ei,1,t3_3oj1b0,bluecamel2015,"Preamble: I personally do not believe in anything 'supernatural'. I am open minded but have never, ever seen any evidence to convince me of aliens, bigfoot, spirits, etc. 

That being said when I was about 11-12 me, my father, and uncle were out one evening hunting during the early archery season. This is Southern Indiana so you can certainly get in areas very far away from other human beings but this is not like being in remote Montana or something.

We we had hiked pretty far back into a big valley. People imaging Indiana as flat but that is northern part. Southern Indiana is very hilly and rocky. We saw nothing and began to head back. At this point it was dark and we were about half way up the valley. Once we got to the top it was a much easier walk that eventually connected to a fire trail. 

**I want to repeat I am SURE there is a very rational, boring explanation to this.**

Well we are walking and all the sudden there was this...noise behind us. I can't explain it. If you talk to people who spend a lot of time in the outdoors they can all tell you weird sounds you hear. I mean it happens. What made this one so fucking weird is it was unlike anything we have ever heard. It was loud. Very loud. The best we can describe it as was a horrible screech with the mix of a growl. I can still hear that noise in my head today. It was genuinely terrifying and in the woods in early archery season can be very noisy but when this screech/growl happened it got quite. Maybe that was just our brains focusing on the unusual noise and ignoring the standard forest 'background noise' but we all remember this noise and how it echoed through the woods and it sounds so fucking unnatural it sounded. It sounded angry.

It seems like am rambling but I just can't tell you how terrifying this noise was. Nothing in any horror film or sound effect has come close to replicating that sound. There are no words to give it justice. 

This is when shit really hits the fan. The second this noise happened  we all of course froze. I was young but still had spent quite a bit of time in the wood but my Father and Uncle have spent a lot of time in the woods and it was very dark and my Uncle was just barely visible in front of my and my Father in our headlamps glow but I remember we all froze in fear and he turned back to my Father me me and asked ""What was..."" and in the process of him saying that we were all 3 turning around back towards the noise. 

You have to remember this all happened very quickly.In reality from the time this awful noise happened and we turned around it had been maybe 5 seconds but as we all collectively turned around there was this bright flash of light. I know how insane that sounds and to this day when we tell this story people usually start to smile or laugh but I am as serious as a heart attack.

As we turned around there was this sudden flash of light in the tree tops. It was bright and covered a very wide area. It lasted a second or two and it went pitch black again.


It was just like the cliche....all three of us with zero words began to run. There was not yelling, no pause, nothing. We all 3 just ran as fast as we could. My Father even started pulling at me up this steep incline but none of us spoke a thing until we got back to our vehicles. 

Now I do not believe it was a UFO; shit I honestly do not believe in UFOs at all. There is no road in that direction but we like to think that maybe the conditions where just right and some large vehicle on a road near by had their lights hit the tree tops or maybe it was like somebody with a flare or some shit but we have all been in the woods and seen cars drive by, many with their blinders on to watch for deer, and this light was not like this. It was sudden, bright, white, and was in the tree tops. I mean as batshit as this sounds it was like those cheesy UFO movies where the alien ship hovers and shines a big light from above. I am not saying that is what it is but that is the best way to describe it. 

We have honestly spent over 10 years running through scenarios and even though my brain tells me ""Dude this shit happens. Do not fall for this. It was just a unusual set of circumstances and in the darkness your brain put the pieces together the best it could. There was no creature or fucking UFO"", but it is hard sometimes when you replay that event in your head. 

If it had maybe been the noise or the light alone I think we would blow it off but it all happened together and that is what really sticks with us all. 

I am going to be that old guy telling this story with the young people mocking me and I can't blame them.......I would too but that does not change what happened and what I experienced.",13,0,1444711449,1444728384

cvxahi1,0,t1_cvxa9l2,bluecamel2015,"A very good question. I have to say that I have only really known collecting in a time period with the internet ( I am a baby in the numismatic world) so I do not have much to compare it with. 

That being said I think the internet did take away much of the 'hunt' of collecting. There was a time where have a complete, let us say Wheat, set was very hard to do and if you ever sold it having all the coins together would bring a very nice premium as in a set would be more valuable as the sum of its part.

Not so much anymore. Now you can go shopping and find coins for your set in a single click.

It is not all bad though. The internet has allowed a collector like myself to have access to an incredibly amount of information and I can talk to other collectors all over the planet. That is extremely valuable.",2,0,1444680165,1444728384

I mean I sent you the links and you can Google the shit yourself. SS is already paying more money out each year than it gets in. So you can do as much fucktard 'envelope calculations' as you want........it does not change reality back here on Planet Earth.

You are wrong and you can't just start throwing out your own personal wanna be numbers to ""convince myself it was ok""",0,0,1444452335,1444728384

An even basic grasp of objective reality.

You can keep 'wishcasting' the facts but sorry. SS is already broke. You are wrong. Again not a debate just a fact. The program is already out of money.

cvuie2b,0,t1_cvuhxp3,bluecamel2015,"Remember that every year part of the money given out to people on SS comes from money from the Social Security Trust Fund which is the government paying loans it made to itself.......even if we IGNORE that aspect SS is already running annual deficits even WITH the Trust Fund payments:

[Even with the accounting fraud SS is already running massive annual shortfalls](http://www.factcheck.org/2011/02/democrats-deny-social-securitys-red-ink/)

Oh and according to the SS Trustees those annual looses will only continue to grow (This remember INCLUDES the bond repayments which are counted as money 'earned' even though they are really debt) until about 2035 when the entire system collapses.

[Trust Fund Report](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/)

Sorry you are so badly misinformed. SS is already insolvent.
The problem is you do not know how to read. You read ""This link says SS is good till 2037"".

First that is bullshit and the entire principal is to ignore the money coming into SS is debt the Government (ie taxpayer) has to payback. 

Second, and MOST important, is that SS is ALREADY running annual deficits. It is just that by 2035-37 the deficits will be SO LARGE the program will be completely underwater.
