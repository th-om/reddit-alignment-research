~90k salary
$5k in IRA/401k

Still dealing with student loans $60k+ that end up being about $1200/mo

Rent is real cheap. We're paying $1800 to rent a house in the 'burbs split between 3 people who have tech jobs. I bought a brand new car straight out of school which was a stupid mistake. Probably should have paid cash for a used car to get by on at first.

I was just getting by on my previous salary with enough to save a few hundred a month. I've been making $90k for a month now and I think I'm finally going to be able to contribute to the house fund with my gf.

Student loans will have to wait because the housing market is growing fast here and we need to get a house before interest rates go up. It's ~$300k for 2000 sq/ft 3bd/2ba anywhere that's remotely desirable to live here.",9,0,1444485629,1444730689

cvuhr0i,1,t3_3o5r0p,trose89,"See I'm pretty sure they can take them down but then again I've seen companies with terrible reviews trying to counter with obvious fake reviews from management. I worked for a place that got acquired by SFX and they're doing the same thing. http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/SFX-Entertainment-Reviews-E320459.htm

If it was as simple as paying to take down these reviews I think they'd do it. They were dropping $100 mil on acquisitions left and right.

FYI they're currently under investigation for fraud...",1,0,1444449157,1444730689
