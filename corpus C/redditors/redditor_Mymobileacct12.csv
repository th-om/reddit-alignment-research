Since the bias does exist, it's important to try and correct for it to some extent rather than ignoring that it exists all together. Segregation only makes the ""other-ism"" worse by formalizing how different they are from you. ",1,0,1444660477,1444719491

cvvvu07,0,t1_cvvudkv,Mymobileacct12,"Humans innately develop the idea of ""others"", and this is very often based on race/nationality, but is believed to be developed by who you've interacted with and your experiences. If you perceive someone as an other you innately dehumanize them to a degree - just like many Americans would be outraged hearing that 30 Americans died abroad that they never knew, but 100 individuals from other nations doesn't trigger a response. 

Since this is commonly based on race, it makes sense to have a police force that approximates who they are policing so that on average the interactions involve someone whose race mirrors each other, otherwise it becomes an us Vs them view, which is obviously contrary to community engagement.",3,0,1444579182,1444719491
cvv737c,0,t1_cvuzv5e,Mymobileacct12,"The odds of an embryo making it full term to birth is less than 1 in 5, or about 400 billion murders by the design of the human body. Always an interesting fact to bring up. ",2,0,1444515487,1444719491
cvu810m,0,t1_cvtofa7,Mymobileacct12,"It could also likely open up dialogue options. I'd be annoyed if it didn't. I feel like perk dialogue really helps with role play, like yes, I am really a robotics expert (deactivates all robots in facility via terminal option). ",1,0,1444429465,1444719491
cvu7xu2,1,t3_3o2kdf,Mymobileacct12,"I believe that it was mentioned that certain ranks of certain perks would be level blocked, so that a 10 str character couldn't take all 4 ranks of the 10th skill by level 5. That would make something like paralyzing palm possible. ",2,0,1444429313,1444719491

cvsol9a,0,t1_cvsi31x,Mymobileacct12,"Yes and no. The DoD often pursues things that haven't been done before, so those are going to take longer, and then they try to integrate them all together and get them to work at very high degrees of certainty in extreme conditions. Tricky stuff. 

They also deal with politics between the services  (see the f35c issue), politics over spending money in congressional districts, politics over who gets to develop what, and possibly corrupt or incompetent acquisitions officials that let defense contractors get away with lots of shit. 

Total mixed bag. Silicon Valley has a lot of advantages though and does move vastly, vastly faster. ",3,0,1444324688,1444719491
cvsmzfc,0,t1_cvskbt8,Mymobileacct12,"Usually gpu is the limiting factor in most games. I suspect an overclocked i5-2500 would run this plus mods without much limitation. 

If you're looking to upgrade and have the money you could do both, but general concensus is that the 4000 series of cpu isn't that inferior to the just released 6000 series (skylake). Now, you have a mid tier of that series, but it's probably fine. 

If the money isn't burning a hole in your pocket and you don't need max graphics, you're probably fine holding off a year or more. /r/buildapc has tons of information. ",3,0,1444322347,1444719491
cvsmd8i,0,t1_cvsg6a4,Mymobileacct12,"I see where costs can drop, but we're up against hard physics here on efficiency. The new record is what, 22%? Clearly you can't double that 3 times without breaking thermodynamics, and even doubling twice is very difficult. 

Still it'd be nice to have a limitless quantity of energy at a cheap enough price to make desalination also cheap, or that makes atmospheric or oceanic cleaning methods practical. ",2,0,1444321434,1444719491
