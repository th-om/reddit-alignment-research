I haven't said guns are bad at all. (I even openly admit I own several)

I merely have said I support licensing and training requirements as a possible limit to the second amendment. 

I also said that label ""pro-life"" is buzz word bingo. The pro-life flag fairly solely applies to rights for the unborn. 

Once again - is a prolife person by modern definition also expected to be anti death penalty? Or is that not part of what qualifies as the intentional termination of life against the private individuals will. The clip takes that point going further in pointing out just how limited the ""pro-life"" focus is currently.

You brought up selling poison labelled as food. Why? who knows. But you must admit that there are processes and materials that exist that are limited by in use by licensing and regulation despite it being on private property.  

>>Cars did not exist at the time that that the bill of rights was drafted in 1791

>And this is relevant how?  

Missiles are also technically ""arms"" - our rights to own, produce, and use within the confines of our own private property are still limited despite the bill of rights. 
Cars, planes, helicopters are all tools that technology advancement has pushed the bounds of what the framers ever even considered. Same goes for rim fire cartridges. To what extent to you believe the framers understood non military munitions an ordinance as arms?

See above.

>>The manufacture, ownership, or distribution of many many things (typically lethal) are regulated and not allowed under the guise of private property.

>And this is relevant how?

T/F: there are federal limits to what you are allowed to own/use even on your private property.

>Ignoring what I said and responding with a bunch of red herrings is not constructive or compelling.  The fact remains, the alleged hypocrisy does not exist.  They are pro-life, as they fully support a complete ban on murder.  It is not hypocrisy to say you are pro-life, while not supporting bans on inanimate objects.

Is the death penalty murder?  Are you proposing that there is no overlap in the Venn diagram  between ""pro-life"" advocates and those that support the death penalty?  Or are those people not (no true Scotsman) ""pro-life""


Question:  
are there limits to the first amendment?

Question if yes:  

Are there limits to the second amendment?

Question if yes:  
If further limits do not fully remove access, does it require a constitution amendment to impose those limits?

Would you think it reasonable to hear that statement in support of scalpel control legislation?  Of course not, that is moronic.  And it is the equivalent of gun control legislation.


A scalpel is a highly specialized knife. The surgical equivalent of a gun would be external beam radiotherapy. You would be hard pressed to find a way to buy
Stereotactic radiotherapy equipment unlicensed and without licensing restrictions around its ammo. 

I mean as long as you are using analogies and all it makes sense to equate knives with knives and guns with ""guns""",1,0,1444233185,1444731144

Many many poisons and biological agents are controlled substances with strict regulations and licensing around their use and sale. 

>Driving on the road is not a constitutionally protected right.  And we do allow unlicensed and untrained drivers to **own** whatever vehicle they want, and drive it on private property all they want.

Cars did not exist at the time that that the bill of rights was drafted in 1791.  When it was drafted, even integrated paper cartridge rounds weren't invented. It was all muzzle loading.   One could easily argue that original intent for arms was in fact muzzle loaders. 

Yes people can do what they want on their own property, but that is a limited right.  The manufacture, ownership, or distribution of many many things (typically lethal) are regulated and not allowed under the guise of private property.

We don't allow unlicensed untrained drivers on the road. 

We don't allow regular licensed individuals to drive tractor trailers without an even more specialized license. 

We also don't allow the purchase of detcord or blasting caps without a chain of custody. 

I'm not for banning guns. I do think that a chain of custody for guns wouldn't be a bad thing. I don't think becoming trained and licensed is an extraordinary burden either. I like that at least with concealed carry laws many gun owners are finally getting training. I live in Texas, have several guns myself. I also know a crap ton of people that have guns (given to them or bought by them for personal safety reasons) that have no clue about gun safety, maintenance, and only the barest understanding of operation. 

 I see nothing significantly wrong with the state knowing what equipment I have and ensuring I have the knowledge to use it safely. ",18,0,1444224496,1444731144
