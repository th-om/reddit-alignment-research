cvjppdb,0,t1_cvjecfu,TypicalUser1,"I guess that's why I tend to group rights in categories, rather than try to rank each one separately. As I said above, I like to group ""welfare"" and other such programs into a ""privileges"" category. I call it this because I believe, when one gets right down to it, it's not something that the government should be dealing with, strictly speaking. However, all things considered, the government is the least inefficient way of accomplishing them.",1,0,1443644958,1444719445
cvjci0k,0,t1_cviys2k,TypicalUser1,"You, kind sir, are perhaps the only person I've ever seen on the Internet to coherently organize rights in such a logical and elegant fashion. I wonder though, would you redefine those rights you consider false or otherwise illusory, such as education, healthcare, etc., as ""privileges"" instead? In this way, we would be adding a fourth category beneath the first three.",1,0,1443626243,1444719445
