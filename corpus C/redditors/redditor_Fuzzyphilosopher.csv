Of course the principals of even small rural elementary schools in the county make $100K and the county pulls in a lot of money from the Army post and government contracts but the county tends to waste it on stupid shit that benefits the Old Boys who run the show.

> Johnny Cash nació en Kingsland, Arkansas,[7] el 26 de febrero de 1932. Fue el cuarto hijo de Ray Cash, oriundo de Kingsland y nacido el 13 de mayo de 1897, y de Carrie Cloveree, de Rison, Arkansas, y nacida el 13 de marzo de 1904.[8] [9] Cash fue bautizado con las siglas de J. R. Cash debido a que sus padres no pensaron en ningún nombre. Cuando se enlistó en las Fuerzas Aéreas, no le dejaron utilizar sus iniciales como nombre, por lo que comenzó a llamarse John R. Cash. En 1955, cuando firmó su primer contrato discográfico con Sun Records, comenzó a utilizar Johnny Cash como nombre artístico.",2,0,1444642504,1444721679

>In 2013 41,149 suicides were reported, making suicide the 10th leading cause of death for Americans. In that year, someone in the country died by suicide every 12.8 minutes. https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures

2nd it just gets special attention when a suicide victim has been in the military because post 9/11 Patriotism.


The rise in suicides is not really due to combat trauma as most people assume. Many of these suicides are by aging Viet Nam era vets who may or may not have seen action, may have only spent a couple years in the military etc but they are suffering the effects of old age in a society where you have to pay for good medical care. 

I see an overlap between this issue and the number of homeless Veterans, and that is the fact that many of these guys were never really able to take care of themselves in the first place. I've worked with men who spent 10 or more years in the infantry but when pushed out for failure to advance etc they had no idea of how to act outside of the army. They didn't know what to do if there was no-one to tell tell them. Many of these guys would have ended up on the streets sooner if not for the Army. It selects for rash people with little sense of possible consequences. Some of the smarter soldiers I've known put on their helmets and kevlar lit a car on fire and drove it off a ramp just for Yee Haws! 

For active duty soldiers suicides on deployment when everyone has a purpose and mission are very rare. Suicides happen when trapped in the BS of meaningless duty on post, and those who've experienced combat are **LESS** likely to kill themselves than other soldiers. - It seems having people try to murder you kinda makes the idea of killing yourself seem stupid, most of the time. 

PTSD is a real thing and I see plenty of drunk driving/riding motorcycles dangerously, because if I survived Iraq nothing can kill me mindset. 

Anyway I'm rambling, the TL;DR is it's complicated and it's usually not combat trauma that leads to suicide by Veterans.

Before Webster's dictionary spelling wasn't standardized and intelligent person was one who could decipher another's spelling and use the available letters to convey his own intended meaning. 

Today proper spelling and punctuation are educational and socio-economic class indicators.
