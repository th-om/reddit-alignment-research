cvxcny1,0,t1_cvwtfvq,palsh7,"Obama was a young black senator without familial wealth or connections who challenged the presumptive nominee and wife of a former President, running on a promise to change Washington and fight corruption, and collecting more small dollar donations than any other candidate in history. Say what you will about his follow through and appointments and pragmatic, politics-as-usual approach to governance, that's still an outsider candidate.",1,0,1444683230,1444717197

cvwgdpp,0,t1_cvw6ob5,palsh7,"Most of them, sure, but we're also coming off of 8 years of an outsider president, and a significant number of people supporting Bernie, who is an even bigger outsider. I definitely wouldn't say that Democrats don't like outsiders.

Can one edit a film he bought on iTunes? Or is this like the thing where it's legal to own lockpicking tools but not legal to purchase them?",1,0,1444587152,1444717197
