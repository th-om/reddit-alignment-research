Fertility clinics give you a tray of embryos to select from and screen for known defects and other traits prior to implantation.  The unwanted embryos are then discarded .. usually incinerated.  They are never implanted and thus never technically aborted but the end result is the same.  So if this is your concern then abortion is irrelevant.  Hell, if anything its the method you'd want to promote because there is a *chance* that having gotten a few weeks into the pregnancy she has developed an emotional attachment that'll change her mind whereas not implanting an embryo from a tube is way easier than aborting both emotionally and physically.

For the record, in the US sex selection is overwhelmingly done to get a ""balanced"" family with one child of each sex.  An imbalance in sex selection indicates a larger societal problem - it is not a problem in and of itself just a symptom of something else.  And you can google fertility clinics to see them all advertising sex screening.

But lets turn this around.  Some couples screen embryos *for deafness*.  They are both deaf, and they want a deaf child.  They didn't think they can relate to a hearing child.  They want a child like themselves.  This is also happening with dwarf couples who want a child their size.

http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/health/05essa.html?_r=0

Who are you to tell them they may not give life to the deaf child they want and must instead bear a hearing child that you prefer?  Hell, you mentioned a ""gay"" gene.  Yeah, some couples will select against it, *but other couples will select for it* and still others won't care.  

Any time parents select *for* something you can't refuse them without denying life to the child they want.  This makes you just as ""bad"" as them.  Because the question isn't ""life or death"".  It's ""this life vs that life"". There is no moral high ground in that game.  

In order for the problems you predict to manifest you need an overarching authority forcing the selection certain ways.  When governments start *legislating* selection or promoting economic schemes that punish selecting ""wrong"" then yeah, dystopia awaits.  But that is its own problem.",-1,0,1444624048,1444717173

Question:

What is the leading cause of maternal death in the US?

Answer:

Pulmonary Embolism.

What is a Pulmonary Embolism?  Well its when a blood clot forms somewhere, breaks free, and clogs up your heart.  You go from feeling fine to dead pretty fast with little warning.  

Now, this doesn't just happen to pregnant women.  It can kill anyone.  But pregnant women die from it at 5 times the rate of the general population.  The reason for this is twofold.  Firstly, embryo's secrete into their mother's blood stream hormones that jack up her blood pressure and blood production.  This is because the embryo feeds by osmosing nutrients across the placenta and the higher her blood pressure the easier this is.  Her blood volume will increase an average of 50% during the pregnancy in response to the embryo's hormones.  

This significantly increases the likelihood of developing a clot that will become a lethal embolism *while also completely obscuring the warning signs that a clot is forming.*  Things that would be red flag warning signs in other people are normal pregnancy symptoms that don't cause any alarm.   

So, lets say I take the 1.3 million women who will abort next year and force them to be pregnant instead.  Only a small percent of them will die from an unanticpatable/unpreventable pulmonary embolism as a result of me forcing them to be pregnant.   But 1.3 million is a big enough number that even a small percent of that amounts to a hefty body count.  

When you add in the rest of the top 5 killers of pregnant women we are talking about me killing 1-2 women per day in the US ( note, to get that number I had to get demographic specific death rates and weight them by the demographics of women who get abortions.  Women who abort are disproportionately low income and minority and both groups have much higher maternal death rates than average. )

You can't force women to be pregnant with out killing some of them.  Its impossible.  

Either you are OK with that or you aren't.

I'm not.

> Simply put, if you don't want pregnancies or STIs, don't have sex.

What If I do want to keep my marriage together so that I can continue to feed the child I already have, but we can't afford another child - or even for me to get pregnant again because I'll lose my job if I get pregnant - and we both make minimum wage which is below the cost of living everywhere but Oregon.

In the 60's Russia got into this really weird place where the Orthodox Russian church had enough control that it got every form of contraception banned ... but not enough control to outlaw abortion.
  
And the Russian health service provided them on demand for free.  

So the entire country couldn't even get condoms, but they could get abortions no problem and because safe abortions were provided by the state we can accurately record how many abortion's happened.  No need to do stuff like look at how many women died each year from DIY injuries and estimate from that number how many women had DIY abortions without dying ... like we do in South America ... we can just count up how many women showed up at the doctor's for an abortion and get accurate stats of their abortion rate.  Hard numbers.

**So we know for sure that in 1965 Russia was having 27 abortions for every 10 live births.**  This was fixed by legalizing and promoting birth control which caused Russian abortion rates to plummet because nobody wants to endure surgery for what can be prevented with a pill.

Again, read about Romania:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_orphans

Did outlawing abortion result in a net increase or a net decrease in respect for life?  Did it result in increased care for the dignity of the most vulnerable *or did it result in tossing them in cages and treating them like feral animals?*

This should be required reading for every person who advocates forced pregnancy on the premise that permitting abortion is a slippery slope that leads to devaluing life.  **Reality shows conclusively that it is precisely the opposite.**

It is when you force the creation of large populations of unwanted children that you create a culture that devalues life.  If I see one unwanted child I can try to find it a home or take it in myself.  One child I can care about.  If I see 1.3 million unwanted children ( per year ) its a problem to big for me to deal with.  *The people of Romania were desensitized to the suffering of children by the orphanages.*  The orphanages set a very, VERY, low bar.  Anything better than that a child was lucky to get.  

Furthermore, there is no quicker way to devaluing the lives of the handicapped than forcing births.  As mother Teresa said, ""It is POVERTY that a child must die that others may live"".  We have lots of surplus money/time/attention to help the handicapped right now.  If you take those surplus resources away then suddenly the handicapped children are in competition with the healthy children for the remaining resources.   And the old are in competition with the young for those same resources.  

The same thing happens if the resources stay the same but you skyrocket the number of people who need them.  We have around 400,000 kids in government care right now.  Adding 1,300,000 million babies to that count next year more than quadruples that number.  The year after that we nearly double the number.  And so on for 18 years till the oldest start aging out of the system.  Where does the money come to provide for them?  What do we cut to provide for them?  

How do we keep Romanian conditions from developing in the orphanages?

>We have been at this very place before. It is thinkable. It was doable.

And every time it was thought of and done it was because of squabbling over scarce resources.  Forcing births is how this shit happens.  Not how you stop it.

cvwiz91,0,t1_cvv2p5n,Mrs_Frisby,"There was an AMA a few years back by a dad with two kids who was on the wait list for a kidney transplant.  He'd been on it awhile and was seriously worried about dying before his number came up.

Being honestly curious - and also wanting to make a political point because I'm an ass that way - I asked him how it felt to live in a country where there is a huge political movement trying to legislate that pregnant women be forced to be organ donors against their will for imaginary people, while actual people like himself are told unequivocally that if they can't find a willing donor then to bad, so sad.  

He replied.  And said that this was something he'd thought of since he went on the wait list and that the absurdity of it all was maddening.  Kidney donation is vastly less invasive than pregnancy.  And he is unquestionably an actual life.  If only one of these things should be seriously politically debated, its forced kidney donation, not forced pregnancy.  

After all, *you don't even need to violate the bodily autonomy of a living person to save his live*.  You could get a kidney from a dead person.  But we won't even do that.  We hold more respect for the wishes of the deceased than the wishes of the pregnant.
