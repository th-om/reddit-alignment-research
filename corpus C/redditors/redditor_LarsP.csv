I don't think anyone can know how much of each would happen, but my guess is it would mostly be the latter. Tech hiring is an employee's market today.",2,0,1444699052,1444725517

cvwoi80,0,t1_cvw1k74,LarsP,"> I mean, say we're discussing any other drug -- you'd never say that we should just assume they're equally dangerous to smoke per gram right?

Can you propose a better assumption?

Again, this is not about the drugs in these plants. It's about carbon content in the smoke.",1,0,1444630341,1444725517
cvw09my,0,t1_cvvtp52,LarsP,"> Simplifying down just to amount smoked is a bit disingenuous though, because the gram for gram risk isn't the same. 

Until we know what plant smoke is more dangerous, assuming that they're equally dangerous per gram until we have more knowledge makes a lot of sense.

Remember that the emphysema connection described here comes from the carbon content, not any of the addictive and toxic components.",1,0,1444586756,1444725517

**But** for that job you definitely want your strongest and longest reaching crew member! Lewis makes a brave decision, but she also jeopardizes the whole rescue by letting a less qualified person do a crucial task.

The Iron Man stuff was far worse though. I can imagine a manager making an unwise decision, but not that would actually work, and we had done **so well** with science until then.",1,0,1444509523,1444725517
