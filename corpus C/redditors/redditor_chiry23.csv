cvx5typ,0,t1_cvx0b34,chiry23,"Even though I've lived in Chicago for almost a year now, I've only gone through O'Hare once. Midway is so, so, so much better it's not even funny. I cannot express how much I hate O'Hare.",1,0,1444673475,1444722018
cvx5p6z,0,t1_cvwybpb,chiry23,"As someone who has lived in Atlanta, the Twin Cities, and Chicago, Atlanta is definitely my favorite airport. MSP isn't as bad as you're saying, but then again I was in the smaller terminal for almost all of my flights. Midway is fine, but a hassle to park at, and O'Hare is the biggest nightmare in the world. I don't get why people would ever go through O'Hare if they can help it.",1,0,1444673282,1444722018

cvx1wy3,0,t1_cvwymqw,chiry23,"Really? That's the ""game winning"" TD you choose? Not the one from 2 years ago where everyone storms the field immediately afterwards? Why'd you even choose to link to that anyways?

Edit: I am a big doo-doo head who types before he knows the situation. I should follow the wise words of Al Pachino more closely; ""You'd know if you spent a day in your life. Don't ever open your mouth 'till you know what the shot is. You're a fucking child.""",-1,0,1444667676,1444722018

cvx1g1k,1,t3_3ofvrk,chiry23,"I mean, he's obviously going to say this. When would someone ever say that their movie (and such a huge, huge movie at that) was changed due to corporate pressures before it's even released? That being said, I'm sure Disney is smart enough to let such a huge preexisting brand have its space.",2,0,1444666957,1444722018
