cvw9xl9,0,t1_cvw814y,xColdmedx,"I agree that marijuana should be legalized for medicinal use. I initially thought that the narrative of the post was going to be about using marijuana for recreational use since it isn't stated in scripture, but the comments seem to be more focused on medicinal use.",6,0,1444601692,1444731544
cvw7ogr,0,t1_cvw6ele,xColdmedx,"To respond to the people looking for leadership talking about marijuana, I did find one talk. [O That Cunning Plan of the Evil One](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/10/o-that-cunning-plan-of-the-evil-one?lang=eng)  by M Russell Ballard states the following: 

> Some of the most addictive drugs that, if abused, can hijack the brain and take away one’s agency include nicotine; opiates—heroin, morphine, and other painkillers; tranquilizers; cocaine; alcohol; marijuana; and methamphetamines.

Edit: Also found [Addiction or Freedom](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1988/10/addiction-or-freedom?lang=eng) by Russel M Nelson stating the following:

> Drugs such as LSD, marijuana, heroin, and cocaine are also endangering people throughout the earth. The noble attributes of reason, integrity, and dignity, which distinguish men and women from all other forms of life, are often the first to be attacked by these drugs and alcohol.",1,0,1444597983,1444731544

cvihhur,1,t3_3mv4gu,xColdmedx,I've always wondered why SNAP isn't like WIC where people get checks labelled with certain food items you can buy at your grocery store. Seems like it would make people healthier and cut down on illegally selling SNAP cards for cash. ,3,0,1443557765,1444731544
cvbtlbr,0,t1_cvbrn7p,xColdmedx,This is something Bernie Sanders and his supporters don't bring up. People on /r/politics somehow believe that we can pay for a social welfare state only by raising taxes on the rich and business. Goes to show how much of a populist he is or how unaware he is on how things actually work in Europe.,24,0,1443042491,1444731544
cv9umii,1,t3_3lv493,xColdmedx,"The temple is tough for me because I feel anxious while doing the endowment. It's almost like I am putting on a performance in front of God and experiencing stage-fright. I focus a lot on the actions and words instead of the meanings since I don't have everything memorized like many who frequently go. I feel bad since I am the guy who needs assistance and takes up everyone's time because I am slow. 

In my first endowment I forgot my name, even when it was announced that those who forgot could stand up and be reminded. I was going through with my wife and her entire family, and I chickened out. Ever since then I can't get over the fact that I messed up my first endowment and almost feel like it's voided in God's eyes.  

With practice I'm sure it will get better, but since I live hours away from a temple and my wife and I are tight because of school and since our child isn't nursery age, it makes it hard to go. It's nice to know that there are others out there that have similar feelings.",13,0,1442894058,1444731544

cv41bfj,0,t1_cv3un4u,xColdmedx,"I didn't serve a mission for various reasons. I thought I was doomed dating and marriage-wise. Thankfully, I was able to meet my wife who was from Utah. Her dad was on the bishopric as well, so I definitely thought that he wouldn't accept me, but he did.

I would think that almost everyone has a family member who didn't go on a mission and is still strong in the church. For me, it is my uncle who served as a Bishop in SLC for a long time. For my wife, it is her grandpa. 

It can feel like nobody accepts you at church for a while, and I felt like this for a few years. Many people ask questions, people talk about their experiences in Elder's Quorum, etc. But, I just had to stop thinking about it and letting it bother me. ",3,0,1442442509,1444731544
