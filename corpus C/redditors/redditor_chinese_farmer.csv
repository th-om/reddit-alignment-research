The 2nd amendment should be limited in a similar way.  That's not unreasonable.  College *kids* are dying for no reason.  Their friends and family left behind will have PTSD or god knows what for years, if not forever.

Spoken like a person who has had to call the cops because someone was trying to break in.  Spoken as a person who almost got jumped recently.  And spoken as a person whos been with a friend when a gun was pulled on them (we were kids).  There are so many loose guns in America any idiot can get one and do anything they want.  When my distant cousin was in HS one day some kids told him they were going to kick his ass or something.  So he goes home, gets the gun and sits around waiting for them.  It goes off and hits his sister in the abdomen - she lived.  This kind of stuff happens all the time.  Even with cops who know better.  You can't have this many loose guns and not have bad shit happen.  And guns are 1 accident devices.

Regular mace / pepper spray will handle most people.  Have you ever been maced?  Mace / pepper spray is cheap and easy to use.  You can get some really good ones (foam, etc) online thats way better than what you can get locally.

I like guns a lot.  I like knives even more.  If I had all the money in the world I'd have a very concerning amount of guns.  I think guns are great.  I do not trust idiots with guns.  I barely trust cops with guns.  My uncle has worked the local PD my whole life.  Most of my close friends are ex mili or are gun enthusiast themselves.

What are the problems with guns for home defense?  They are expensive, they misfire, they backfire, they jam due to failure to feed or failure to eject, you miss, you drop the gun, the bullet hits someone else, the attacker gets the gun from you, you cant get to the gun in the first place because it's in a safe and/or you keep the gun unloaded for safety reasons.",2,0,1444424692,1444721868

this week ; in a home depot parking lot an armed citizen took the law into their own hands.  a loss prevention person was chasing a shoplifter, as their car drove away the citizen opened fire on the vehicle

a few weeks ago ; an armed citizen saw a car jacking taking place.  in attempt to help they opened fire, striking the *victim* of the carjacking in the head

tell me again how having a bunch of armed idiots is going to help.  they're not trained, spend no time at the range, and have terrible judgement / impulse control.  none of them wear uniforms, right?  so you see a guy going nuts shooting at folks.  you open fire on him.  someone across the way hears all this, they open fire.  but they only see you - some guy with a gun.  so now youre shooting at the bad guy, and someone is shooting at you.  none of you are cops and you have no idea whats going on or what youre doing.  and no one has any way to tell which one of you is the bad guy.  real fun when the cops show up.

having people armed on campus may help stop a few crimes.  but its going to end in tragedy too.

The Commission found that the Department had not been given sufficient resources to meet its requirements without ""cutting corners"", and was frequently forced to accept poor quality standards due to its lack of funding.[2] The report of the Commission concluded that given the department's state, ""*a tragedy such as Cave Creek was almost bound to happen*"".

oh.my.god.

>A Commission of Inquiry into the accident, headed by District Judge Graeme Noble, highlighted a number of serious concerns with the Department of Conservation's construction of the platform. Specific concerns that were raised included:

- The platform had not been designed or approved by a qualified engineer.

- None of the people involved in building the platform were qualified engineers.

- Nails were used to secure the platform instead of bolts (as intended by the design), because an appropriate drill had not been taken to the building site.

- The platform was not listed in any register that would have resulted in regular inspections.

- A warning sign for the platform, suggesting a maximum limit of five people, had been ordered but was never installed at the site.
