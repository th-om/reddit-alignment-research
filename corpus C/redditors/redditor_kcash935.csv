Downvotes, more than likely, from your fans as well. 

>You can have a clutch performance or perform well ""in the clutch"" and still lose the game, IMO. A mediocre (at best) PSU team down 17 to a really good Ohio State team comes back to tie the game and take them to OT.

But that's the point. He didn't have a clutch performance outside of the last drive. He was 31-49 for 224 yards, a td and 2 INTs. That's not a clutch performance. 

Once again I'll say it, and most OSU fans will tell you, the OSU that played in the PSU game was not nearly the same caliber as the one that bulldozed their way to the natty. In fact, most people consider the PSU game the game where we turned the corner and came together to start that march towards the postseason.",-4,0,1444674316,1444725301

I'll give you the last drive, but I don't consider an overall bad game in a loss a clutch performance. ",-3,0,1444673265,1444725301
cvx5g0k,0,t1_cvx57fz,kcash935,"Haha, yeah, on Reddit. There's also probably a lot of our own fans that would agree with me. Using two comments from our own fans is your argument? 

How are you clutch if you lost the game? That just doesn't make sense.

Edit: Again I'll say it, the team that played PSU is not the same team that finished the season. ",-4,0,1444672913,1444725301
cvx52px,0,t1_cvx4k4z,kcash935,"I wouldn't consider 17 points ""way down"". Also, the national champions, really? The team that played in that game and the team that became national champions were not on the same level. ",-4,0,1444672382,1444725301
cvx22vw,0,t1_cvx1m2b,kcash935,"No, we need a guy that plays defense next to Pirlo. It's well known that Pirlo lacks a defensive game for the most part. Pirlo is the playmaker that we have in that area. We need a guy that makes up for his defensive ineptitude. 

Edit: As evidenced by this season, we can score goals. What we can't do very well is defend.",3,0,1444667927,1444725301
cvx1095,0,t1_cvwyziu,kcash935,">Jacobson's defense has been subpar for most of the year.  He rarely makes more than 1-2 tackles and interceptions a game.

Jacobson has been a solid CDM. Defense subpar? First I've heard that. 

Also, if your sole rating of a defensive player is the number of tackles and interceptions in a game, you're rating them wrong. Their positioning, hustle, etc., are HUGE, but typically go overlooked. The best defenders are oftentimes the ones that you don't hear about all the time because their position is on point. ",3,0,1444666255,1444725301
cvx00s8,0,t1_cvwzxue,kcash935,I most certainly remember it. But how is it a clutch performance in a loss at home. That just doesn't make sense to me. ,-6,0,1444664676,1444725301
