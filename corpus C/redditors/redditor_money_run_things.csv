It seems that we have been talking past each other.  If you were not arguing that the parents should have pressed charges, then we do not have much of a disagreement.  ",1,0,1444688019,1444719216

cvxes9n,0,t1_cvx5dk4,money_run_things,"> First off, I didn't say he should be arrested lmfao.
You specifically said that the parents should press charges.  Pressing charges would equal grand theft, which would lead to an arrest.  Does that basic logic elude you?
> Basically if your son was killing stray dogs and cats, would you take him to a psychologist/therapist or let him continue his psychopathical tendencies simply because you don't want it to go on his record.

This is a major red herring.  Comparing a financial loss of a parent to the death and suffering of an animal that is capable of feeling pain is in no way equivalent.  

> Letting it slide as a father/mother figure will simply encourage them to continue and eventually progress onto something worse.  If it were something smaller then sure let it go, but not after multiple times.

This is not what was being argued initially.  OP said nothing about the parents trying an alternative punishment, in fact she seems in say that the Father mostly ignored it.

cvwygvp,0,t1_cvwy88j,money_run_things,"it's interesting to me that you think this kid should go be arrested.  This would put something on his recored permanently.  This will make it more difficult for him to be employed for years to come.  It will also close the door to come career paths.  Spending time in jail and having a shitty job with little opportunity for advancement is a recipe for more crime. 

Everyone makes mistakes when your young; there is more than one way to teach a kid a lesson.  If I were a parent I would explore all other options before I turned my kid into the police.  I don't want to ruin my kids potential. I want to help him turn it around and succeed.  ",-4,0,1444662057,1444719216
