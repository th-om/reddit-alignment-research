* Most influential FLOTUS in US History - only one to leave the East Wing and move to the West Wing
* Strong non-single-payer health-care regulation champion as FLOTUS
* Two-term Senator - socially liberal voting record with a moderate war-time and economic voting record
* 4 years as Secretary of State - strong team-player with Obama adminstration
* Well-respected by the GOP when the GOP isn't running for Office: http://thehill.com/homenews/207212-hillarys-secret-weapon-gop-praise
* Immensely well-respected by Democratic politicians and the DNC
* Endorsed by: 36 Current and Former Senators, 20 current and former Governors, 102 current and former House member, 1 Secretary of * * State, 26 state politicians, 14 organizations and lastly one US President [who would get a West Wing office]

Essentially she is EXACTLY what we need as the next president: Well-rounded leader that gets bi-partisan cooperation and has Executive and Congressional policy experience. Plus, 4 years in a major foreign policy role - already has a working relationship with most heads of state.",3,0,1443849961,1444730932
