cvx1jq9,1,t3_3oenwa,clydex,"No, not a deal breaker. As you get older (I'm guessing most posters saying it is a deal breaker are in their 20s) other things become more important. That's not to say it won't be an issue but being honest (yes be honest) and working through it with a partner will make things better for both of you.

You're not a slut and of course you're loveable, don't ever let someone tell you otherwise.",1,0,1444667116,1444731946
cvutmde,0,t1_cvusdme,clydex,"I hear ya. But WWI and WWII were essentially wars of western Europe. I can't ever imagine a war in western Europe now, yes partly due to MAD but also because of what you stated about the loss of life from the two wars, they aren't going to go down that road again. If France invaded Germany today, that would not start a World War between us and Russia.

And if you add in the lives lost from [Stalin and Mao](http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm) you are into the numbers of WWI and WWII. And the Rwanda then Congo wars of 1994-2001 killed over 7 million people.

So the wars per generation, or more, that plagued Europe for thousands of years are over but the death toll continued after WWII. It's just that millions have died with no witness and little concern of the west.

I think the spread of Democracy, especially in Europe, the creation of the UN and the expansion of the global economy are as much responsible for peace as anything else.",0,0,1444490389,1444731946
cvurz6j,0,t1_cvul64r,clydex,"Sort of. The USA and USSR didn't fight each other but they fought plenty of proxy wars, and supported intelligence services that killed millions of people.

Korea, Viet Nam, Afghanistan (the Soviet version), Indonesia, Angola, El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile, Cambodia, Laos, and many more are examples.

[Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366) alone had 500,000 deaths in their anti communist purge. That is more than the US death toll in all of WWII.",7,0,1444486634,1444731946
cvurgvu,1,t3_3o2b3y,clydex,"We did the same thing for a liquor store. The floor was crazy out of level. We left the main floor alone but fixed it just under the coolers. We also were limited with height because of sprinklers. Here is what we did.

We put down 2x material 16"" OC with 3/4"" ply over it, that's all they required but we could have put on another substrate and installed tile or whatever. First we scribed the 2x4 to the floor. Then we placed it back on the floor. Our laser was set at the right height so we could just mark it and run it through the table saw.

It went fairly quick actually. Each 2x was cut (scribed then ripped) twice and installed. It turned out almost perfect.

cvuqzjt,1,t3_3o7dfz,clydex,"When I was 20 my then girl friend and I got pregnant. She chose, with my support, to have an abortion. The choice hasn't haunted me or anything but I sure wish she hadn't gotten pregnant. We were using birth control but not super responsibly. She also had some real bleeding issues for a couple months after.

Believe me, it is better if you never have to make that decision and go through it. Just continue to use birth control and be smart.",3,0,1444484085,1444731946

cvuhnoo,1,t3_3nuod1,clydex,"My friend in college (US) went to boarding school in Ireland and his mom is English. He introduced me to Marmite one drunk evening. From my understanding Vegemite is just the Aussie version of Marmite or vice versa?

The first time I tried it, it was like eating rotten coffee grounds. I vowed never to have that stuff enter my mouth again. Drunk again, tried it again. Salty, kinda weird. The third time, this is the most uniquely delicious thing I have ever tasted in my life. I LOVE it to this day, there is just nothing like it. Whomever came up with that stuff was brilliant.",2,0,1444448939,1444731946
cvuh8wf,1,t3_3o3a6c,clydex,"To be skilled in carpentry, like anything else, you need to be taught. To start working for a cabinet maker or a furniture maker (very rare) you need to be skilled. You would either get that skill through school or experience.

I would go the experience route. If you were to get a job in residential remodeling you could start to build your skill set. I would recommend residential remodeling because you tend to be working for a small company that would do a variety of things from kitchen remodels to decks to new garages or whatever. Once you gain some skill in that area it is easily transferable to different areas of carpentry, like furniture making. 

That is how I started out. Now I own a general contracting company, which I love. Making custom pieces is part of what we do, it is one of my favorite aspects of the job.

If you were to go the school route, Ashville NC is know for some great schools along with Boston. Good luck!",2,0,1444447955,1444731946
