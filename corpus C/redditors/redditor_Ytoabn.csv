**ID:** EED5-0000-00A4-8737

**Description of Gameplay Elements:** Yoshi's Spitfire is back, and it's bigger than ever. Prepare for a more difficult challenge trying to time your fireballs to get past enemies. More complicated puzzles include a ""Reset"" door so if you miss a fireball, you can try again. There is also a checkpoint system before the Bowser boss fight, where you'll be dodging fireballs, bob-ombs, and lava trying to get Bowser Thwomp-ed.

cvvtum2,0,t1_cvvtlrc,Ytoabn,"I wasn't able to beat your level. I hate fighting those hammer bros, can never get past them without taking damage. One concern, in the first Bowser fight I know I'm going to face another Bowser because of the fire. So I have no motivation to fight him normally. Instead, I just try to rush past him to get to the real boss fight. Might want to use a sub-level to hide the real boss fight.

cvvtjg6,0,t1_cvvt84s,Ytoabn,"Okay, I made a lot of noise clacking my joy stick back and forth trying to climb the conveyor belts. I enjoyed making huge jumps with conveyor belts helping me. However, I stopped playing after you started putting Spiny on the conveyor belts.

Overall I didn't enjoy the level. I'm sorry but going back and forth on conveyor belts is very frustrating. Giving me a way to try jumps again kept me in it longer, but I don't find the back and forth of conveyor belts fun. If you want to keep this concept, you could use it as a punishment. If you miss a jump, you have to go through the back and forth craziness. Sorry, but overall I didn't enjoy this level. I did leave a star, please keep trying.

It is worth noting that the level of the ground can be very important for pulling this trick off just right.",1,0,1444573331,1444718104
cvvszrk,0,t1_cvvqm36,Ytoabn,"I played your course, beat it, and left a star. It took me a while to get what you meant by grab (wall jumping) but that is an interesting concept. It's unfortunate that you can't be very precise with the wall jumping as it limits your range.

Also, my score was 71800.
