Funny thing here is that you can't make a safe car. A car is at least as deadly of a weapon as a gun. Im not even going to bring in statistics of how many more people die in cars than guns. Cars are massive metal death machines waiting to happen. but there is a common ground between both, and that is this odd thing called the 'end user'. There is a reason why 'guns dont kill people, people kill people' is tossed around and that is because its true. Banning guns just does not do anything to make us safer. ",1,0,1444693412,1444723756

It would be a big gamble thoug, as there would be the potential to use this as incentive to move into space faster. Between the overpopulation problem, being imortal(safety), and who knows how long to research. 

Not to mention it's extremly unlikely you'll ever see civilization fall. The people now become the worlds best data storage also as info the memorized wouldn't disappear.

Overall I think it would be a net benefit to the human race.",2,0,1444692426,1444723756

Splitting hairs here. These cars are not legal because they are not up to standards. This can be fixed if the manufacturer chooses to redesign the car. 

It really isnt the same thing as a ban, which you cannot get around. ",1,0,1444687584,1444723756
