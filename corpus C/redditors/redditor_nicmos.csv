cvx72w2,1,t3_3oewzf,nicmos,"I would say my symptoms and triggers are fairly similar to yours.  I have had symptoms for more than 10 years, and only a few months ago was the first time I ever had diarrhea as a symptom. Normally it's horrible abdominal pain, feeling like my ""pipes"" are stopped up and all I want to do is release the pressure.  And yes, nausea and horrible retching and vomiting.

My flares don't happen enough (fortunately I guess) for me to have figured out for sure what cause them but it seems to be excessive fiber, and one time recently it was after I got a coffee at Starbucks for the first time in a couple years, and I know just a regular coffee there has a lot of caffeine.",1,0,1444675268,1444723620
cvvvesj,1,t3_3oc1px,nicmos,"as a dad, I found I had no attachment for the first 2 months for sure, and it wasn't very rewarding through maybe 5 months.  it got way way better and now, while it's still a lot of work, I love it. It gets much better when you get that emotional feedback from your little one.  when they can smile and laugh.  I would just encourage you to hang in there!",8,0,1444578378,1444723620

cvrg8nj,0,t1_cvrcik8,nicmos,"so I agree with the sentiment, but...

not exactly.  you have to find a country willing to take you (being serious, not snarky).  you can't just up and go to any country you want.  Americans are very familiar with this concept, it's called illegal immigration.  there are proper immigration channels.

I wish they would leave.

I haven't bought any in quite a while, I would guess about 2 years.  So they stopped selling this?",5,0,1444167020,1444723620
