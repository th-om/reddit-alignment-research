How about this for a comparison: if Ethiopia suddenly experienced a famine like they did in the 90's, would Habitat For Humanity be wrong for building homes instead of bringing in food? That would be silly, because HFH isn't a food relief organization. In the same way, BLM isn't a movement dedicated to black on black violence. They're not required to be.",1,0,1442855259,1444726412

Right, and the whole article is making a fourth amendment case that this cop's commands weren't constitutionally legal. It's not clear-cut, but it's a case to be made and that's what the article is about.

> Because when people pose themselves as risks, it's often too late to defend yourself.

That just cannot be the yardstick that we use. That logic alone allows police to use force against anyone, all the time, for any reason. That's so obvious.

I'd say that this is a big problem, that some cops think any amount of disobedience, no matter how inconsequential, validates the use of violent force. Why would you EVER have to use physical force against someone who has not only not posed any threat to the officer, but not even demonstrated any ability to pose a threat? The cop let his anger dictate the way he treated Bland. I expect better from the police.",0,0,1442805992,1444726412
