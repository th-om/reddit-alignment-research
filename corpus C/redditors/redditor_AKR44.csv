cvvoeni,0,t1_cvrr9ai,AKR44,That Carrs gives me the creeps every time I drive by there. I feel like I would be mugged standing in line at the check out. ,1,0,1444556850,1444726904
cvvnrxl,1,t3_3o7kdu,AKR44,I miss not having to pay bills or really think about the future or worry about money. I miss being fairly ignorant of politics and how much it affects the world. I miss actually getting a summer vacation. We work way too fucking much as adults in the US and we don't really have a choice. ,1,0,1444553942,1444726904

cvukm9d,1,t3_3o2z7q,AKR44,"Seeing the Northern Lights pulsate rapidly here in Alaska. Normally, the lights will move slowly across the sky almost like a gentle tide. After seeing them move slowly for 33 years, one night a couple of years ago, they were insane. It was like the sky was shorting out. There were all of these rapid fire green spots lighting up the atmosphere EVERYwhere. I've never seeing anything like it. Such an amazing experience. ",1,0,1444457035,1444726904

cvukgqc,1,t3_3o5k6s,AKR44,"Fucking analog clocks with hands that make that incessant ""tick, tick, tick"" noise. People at work think I'm weird because the first thing I do when I come in for my shift is take the dumb clock off the wall and go hide it where I can't hear it for my entire shift. I don't know why they don't bother anyone else. Those things should be outlawed. ",2,0,1444456523,1444726904

cvsweep,1,t3_3nzftd,AKR44,"I'm in Alaska and some dude from another state called and left a message on my cell. He was like, ""Hey, I'm comin' up there to do some fishin'. I'll see you soon!"" And then broke into some ridiculous acapella song that he made up, and then, finished it up with his harmonica. I put it on speaker and recorded it and still have it somewhere.
