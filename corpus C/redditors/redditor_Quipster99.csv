Work, sure. People doing work is A-OK. People having jobs? Not so much.

Jobs is the problem here. We simply don't need so many people. We removed 98% of the people from agriculture over the past century or two. We're on the threshold of doing the same to the transportation industry, and have been slowly doing the same to most other industries.

[We have the capability to provide for our people almost completely without the need to work.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) We can design and construct machines to create sustenance for all because we have all the material and intellectual resources we need to do so. We don't simply because there is no monetary profit in ensuring every Canadian is fed, housed, and has access to avenues of self-betterment.

Our PM should not be encouraging job growth. They should be leveraging our immense material, human, and technological resources to free us from the entire concept of ""jobs"", and allow those who choose to be passionate about something to pursue it to whatever degree they wish, at whatever point in their life they wish to do so.

This problem will continue to get worse until we solve it. If we slap another band-aid on it (in the form of creating more hollow, pointless, unneeded jobs for people), then we kick the can and will need to deal with a worse situation in a decade or so (if that). [Many prominent businessmen, economists, and technology experts](http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/08/06/future-of-jobs/) agree that unless we do something about it, we're in for some chop. Of course the other half believe that if we just ignore the situation hard enough, everything will work out. [Just like last time.](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/?no-ist=&page=2)

The opposition (like the top comment on this thread right now), believe everything will be peachy if we just continue to ignore the real problem and put band-aids where the skin is sloughing off.

The bottom line is that mandatory work sucks, and is far from necessary. We've had the capability to freely provide a basic dignified living standard to everyone for some time. With basic necessities viewed as a human right instead of an increasingly burdensome expense, people would be free to pursue their own interests and passions to whatever degree they desire.

AI will soon be able to displace high-skill, high-wage workers in addition to lower paid ones. Self-driving cars will soon displace the entire transport industry.

And you suggest we'll just continue dreaming up busywork to attempt to keep everyone employed ad nauseum, even once we've done for all the other necessities of life what we've done for food production?
