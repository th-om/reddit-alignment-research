cvwzi1s,0,t1_cvwz370,repsilat,"At the moment the big question is how you count the ""money earned"" in a given place. Some companies might have large profit centres (like sales) in one country, and large cost centres (worker bees) in another. How much tax should ""the company"" (actually several legal entities) pay in each country?

It's probably clear enough that taxing profits is flawed, especially if the interacting entities are allowed to manipulate the rates they charge each other to adjust the amount of profit that resides in each jurisdiction. I don't know the answer here, though. I suspect the tractability of the problem is related directly to the difficulty of answering the question ""Are these two entities actually the same company?""

If you can definitively answer that question, you might be able to say ""We'll levy taxes equal to your worldwide profits divided by the proportion of your spending that occurs in our country."" That might not be possible, though.",2,0,1444663812,1444728516
cvwuxwv,0,t1_cvwu9bj,repsilat,"> Lol if banks left the UK, others would rise to the occasion

They're not talking about savings and mortgages leaving the country, they're talking about (international) financial services. The banking sector ""exports"" those services all around the world, meaning they bring money into the country. If the big players decided to provide those same services from a country with a more agreeable legal system, I don't think it's given that the sector would bounce back locally.

Sure, a lot of local expertise would still be here, but they would be at a distinct competitive disadvantage.",20,0,1444654738,1444728516

Per kilometre driven, trucks cause far more road damage than cars. It makes sense for them to have to pick up some of that negative externality, and if that cost drives them out of business then it's probably a good thing -- better to subsidise those truck drivers to sit at home playing videogames than to subsidise them ruining the roads and the environment (and making the streets more congested to boot.)",41,0,1444653781,1444728516

I mostly asked because see a lot of people saying crazy things like ""I could see myself voting for a Republican, but not an extremist like Romney."" I wonder whether it's too convenient that one side could have a monopoly both on sound policy and on qualifications for the job -- essentially, to what degree does motivated reasoning colour people's arguments (and their voting decisions)?",1,0,1444314939,1444728516
