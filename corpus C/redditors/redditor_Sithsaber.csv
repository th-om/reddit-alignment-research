cvw1uze,0,t1_cvvywt0,Sithsaber,"Magical indeed. I was hoping we could have gone all out on the propaganda before this got sidetracked. Think of it: socialist peridots standing in rows, smiling happy maoist smiles while they ease incubators into the rocky ground. Pearls feeling alienated by the decadence that led to their very creation. The efficient  jumpsuits of the future worn by all regardless of sex or production model!

It would have been glorious. Sadly yalls got distracted and threw away this opportunity.",1,0,1444589231,1444732064

cvvg13g,1,t3_3oahnw,Sithsaber,"Be mindful of three things:

1) I'm being overdramatic. That's the joke.

2) I stepped on the transexuality landmine. Now i'll put this out there and say that wearing a dress one time does not make you trans or intersex. I've also doubled down on my belief that Steven in a dress was shown for laughs, not as something meant to be groundbreaking. I grew up on Bugs Bunny, Timon, Pumba and Martin Lawrence; I know a bit when I see one.
