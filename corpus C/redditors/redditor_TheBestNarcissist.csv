cvqmtgr,0,t1_cvqicqg,TheBestNarcissist,"I'm in dental school. The thing about dentists charging max is simply not true.

Doctors have very little say in what they're reimbursed by insurance companies, that's totally true. Dentists, just like any other business, need profit to function. Without any context, what probably happened is that the dentist (or probably a staff member) would have haggled for X insurance code over Y insurance code. How different diagnoses affect treatment (and thus procedure/insurance codes) gets really complicated. What could have happened was that the dentist performed X because he knew it was covered and it didn't make a big difference in treatment results, even though Y is usually done instead. Insurance charges Y because that's what's usually done. Now the patient get's a big hefty bill even though the doc said he was covered. He calls doc and he's mad (obviously, that crook of a dentist just fucked him out of 300-1000 dollars just so he can buy *another* boat). 

Any reasonable dentist would do the same thing as OP's dentist, even though it's not immediately his problem. Why? Because the patient is going to fucking love you for sticking up for them. That's good for business. AND because the only hate stronger towards dentists from people who don't like dentists, is the type of hate dentists have for insurance companies.

cvft2qz,1,t3_3mk9xs,TheBestNarcissist,"Yes I would, I would have pushed her on the swing. Because I'm not creepy and people need to realize that adult men are not always a threat to children. Admittedly being a fairly attractive 24 year old gives me an advantage in (hopefully) not receiving negative feedback from the women around me. But by not playing with that little kiddo, I'm not doing anything to dispel the terrible stereotype that men are threats to children.
