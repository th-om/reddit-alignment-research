cvq757m,0,t1_cvpa8vp,daddysgun,">  I feel like they earned all there money. I know that's probably not a popular thought around here.

First, how many of the obscenely wealthy inherited their wealth (or the first large part of it that allowed them to gain the rest)?  In my mind, inheriting money is not the same as earning it.   

Second, when you look at exactly how vast fortunes are built, you understand that money isn't really ""earned"" so much as it is ""taken"" from other people using the unfair advantages and power that wealth gives you.   For example, if your company increases profits by two billion dollars after outsourcing 200,000 American jobs to China and India, did you really ""earn"" two billion dollars or did you simply take that money away from the Americans whose jobs you sold out and put it it in your own pocket?    Same thing with tax shelters--if you get an extra 3 million dollars by staying your money away in an offshore tax break designed for the purpose of not paying taxes, did you actually ""earn"" that 3 million dollars or did you just legally cheat the government out of having it so you could keep it in your pocket?

Recognize greed for what it is and stop glorifying it. It's not pretty and it will destroy us all.",1,0,1444147489,1444717956

Why didn't they insist on some kind of time limit for these investigations, and if nothing turns up in that time limit then the investigation goes back up for a vote again whether to continue?

cvq1vjx,1,t3_3nne71,daddysgun,"I briefly dated a conspiracy theory nut who was convinced that Obama and the Illuminati are trying to impose martial law and new world order, something like that.  The first step, he insisted, was Obama's efforts to try and disarm the populace.   I am baffled that people think this is what ""they"" would try to do if ""they"" wanted to take over and impose martial law.

Suppose there's some giant government entity that is poised, just slobbering to clamp down on the populace and impose absolute control.  Would they find it easier to do that and justify the steps necessary if the populace is unarmed and peaceful, doing nothing particularly alarming; or would they have an easier time imposing their will if everyone is armed and shooting each other all over the place?   If there is someone who wants to impose control over the populace, the last thing they want is to disarm us.  They want us armed doing just what we're doing so they can claim every form of control they impose on us is necessary for order and safety.

cvq1p3c,1,t3_3nmbb0,daddysgun,"In my mind, gun control laws will work more in the way that they change the American attitude toward guns than in any actual practicality.  Like drunk driving laws.  Once upon a time, getting smashed and driving home was no big deal, something you may not do but live and let live, you didn't think anything about it if someone else did it.  Now, you can't hardly have a sip of wine at dinner without everyone at your table checking to make sure you're okay to drive afterward.  And if you judge yourself to be okay to drive, while your friends think otherwise, you suffer their judgment and condemnation.  They will talk about you in disapproval.   MADD changed the American attitude toward drinking and driving.   We had a similar change in attitude toward smoking.  Now we need an attitude adjustment toward guns, and for the same reason: they are hurting, killing people and we have the right to care about actions that people take that can hurt or kill people.",5,0,1444138195,1444717956

But since you want to be like that about it, the fact is, people who live in civilized society are going to support each other, in one way or another, and you are supporting a lot of uglier, more damaging character flaws than bad financial planning. You're supporting corporate greed, war mongering, political corruption, criminal injustice, the failed war on drugs, etc.  So maybe you can stop picking on the one group of people with the least amount of power or voice and turn your angst to those you support who actually have the power to game the system and actually affect your life.",1,0,1444067912,1444717956
