cvka4ik,0,t1_cvjzmtv,norahceh,I think you described how democracy should work. The down votes are indicative of why it unfortunately often doesn't. I respect Bernie because despite the downvotes he has received over his career he continues to do exactly what you describe.,4,0,1443684033,1444723502

You claim a product is safe, yet are unwilling to provide evidence of that and attack those who provide evidence that there are risks present.

It is this kind of addict behavior that makes it difficult for the adults who seek to change the legislative rules.

cvhbhl5,0,t1_cvgleal,norahceh,"""There are various mechanisms which are responsible for its neurotoxic effects, such as NMDA
antagonism, enzyme inhibition and alteration of cerebral blood flow. Different brain conditions have
different vulnerabilities to each form of toxicity, with neonatal brains more susceptible to NMDA
antagonism, vitamin B12 deficient patients more prone to homocysteine mediated problems and the
damaged brain often more vulnerable to changes in cerebral blood flow. Because of this, there is
a wide range of patients to whom N2O may have some form of toxicity, with different groups being at
greater risks than others. In this way it is extremely important to understand all the needs of a patient
before giving nitrous oxide. The danger arises when nitrous oxide is given during dental procedures
or as emergency analgesia, e.g., en route to hospital, where underlying problems such as vitamin
B12 deficiencies may be undetected. One case study details a patient who presented with weakness in
her lower limbs as well as peripheral numbness [36]. MRI scans showed abnormalities on the cervical
spinal cord consistent with small lesions. The patient was found to be deficient in vitamin B12 and had
been exposed to nitrous oxide for dental surgeries 2–3 months previously. Following 10 months of
vitamin B12 injections the symptoms had abated, yet this could have been avoided altogether if nitrous
oxide had been avoided for this patient. This highlights the need to fully elucidate nitrous oxide
mechanisms of toxicity, so that clinicians can make informed decisions regarding N2O use. This case is
reflected in further case reports involving patients with no prior N2O abuse experiencing myelopathies
following N2O anaesthesia [48], as well as patients with a history of N2O abuse [49–52]. ""
