cv9tzro,0,t1_cv9tn94,TheElusiveGnome,"Look, it's my personal belief that you should respect the uniform. If you were OP and you were looking at the pictures in Sac Hall, then no, you shouldn't have to stop looking at those pictures because it's not illegal and it's not violating university policy. But if that proverbial lawn of yours had a no trespassing sign, and a CSS/CSO told you to get off, then it would be smart to get off, because if not the actual police officers with handcuffs would have to get involved.

cv9tgp6,0,t1_cv9t9bp,TheElusiveGnome,"CSOs are students who work part time, and are employed by the university. CSSs work full time and are employed by the police department (hence they get to wear badges). In reality a CSS has no more power than a CSO, they just get paid more.",1,0,1442891851,1444727972
