cuymfyg,1,t3_3kkb0r,DeHominisDignitate,"1 - I was in my 8th Grade reading class - either second or third period - during which I was reading The Face on the Milk Carton.  Our teachers had told us to put down our books, and, after a brief break, they had set up one of the TV's on movable carts in the library along with some other classes.  They had put on the news, and, honestly, I do not remember whether it was live or recap when the second tower hit.  Given the time frame, I can only imagine that we were watching playbacks.  I grew up in a suburb on the outskirts of Nassau County, and a large majority of the students' parents - usually at least one - worked in the city.  Concern was exacerbated due to congested networks, it was incredibly hard to know what was going on and get in contact.  Overall, a deeply troubling and terrifying time with constant reminders in the form of news and the billowing cloud of brown and black smoke.

2 - I think it is hard to ascribe anything that us as a collective conscience learned from that one moment.  I think it is possible - for better or worse - we learned - or were reminded - that we were not untouchable and that the vast expanses of the Pacific and Atlantic would not keep us safe.  Maybe I was too young to remember or care about partisanship, but, in my memory, it did seem to be unifying across political ideologies, racial barriers, social strata, etc.  Unfortunately, this lesson has not stuck.

3 - I honestly do not know, and, to be truthful, I would be incredulous if anyone claimed they do.  Maybe with hindsight it would be different.  In the immediate moments, I am sure that he was collecting his thoughts as he read to them.  It is also entirely possible the secret service had to make sure it was secure before he could move.  While I am far from having any basis of knowledge in how the secret service or even typical security operate, I cannot fathom that they would not ensure the area was safe.  Yes - it was a school, but it was certainly public knowledge he would be there and would seem like a possibility that the coordinated attack had people on the ground waiting for the president to move in the chaos.

I think overall he handled the immediacy of the attack incredibly well and was an immensely effective leader and figurehead.  I am not speaking in regards to the subsequent Iraq War.  I think it is important to remember that 9/11 was the single greatest threat to both our nation's sovereignty and way of life since Pearl Harbor.  In my memory, he was an immensely tactful and compassionate leader during those times.

4 - I think we are fairly safe, and I think the vast majority of attacks will be prevented before they ever coalesce.  That being said, all it takes is one to get through.  I think the risk of terrorism from domestic sources if of far greater concern - either from converts to the ISIL theology or from extremists at home.",1,0,1442024701,1444730032
