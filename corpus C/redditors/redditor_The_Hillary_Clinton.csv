The question comes down to vote rigging, as multiple accounts are acceptable here but vote rigging is not.  ",-1,0,1443822891,1444718430

Your posting history is similar and it appears from a couple of glances that you and them have done this in the past with double teaming in join session with those accounts.  Coupled with the confirmation of /u/awa64 and /u/SapCPark is managed by the same person, its pretty logical that the same person manages all four.

And the President doesn't have control of the budgets, that is Congress.

Also, its clear that /u/awa64 is managed by the same person that manages /u/SapCPark. They are the only user that would have been notified by my comment and you haven't been active for over an hour.  I didn't tag you as a user in the comment, so you didn't get a notification by the system.

It would be logically impossible for you to have discovered my post within 2 minutes of it being posted and comment otherwise.   ",0,0,1443822155,1444718430
