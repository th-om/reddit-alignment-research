cuye9th,0,t1_cuydvxl,sammiedv,That 100% sounds like me thank you so much for posting as I think l this could really help me figure out what's up,2,0,1442008397,1444729705
cuydsa6,0,t1_cuyd1pj,sammiedv,Thank you for your reply! Does this type of narcolepsy have a specific name? ,2,0,1442007540,1444729705
cuyczxt,0,t1_cuxuect,sammiedv,"As and eighteen year old who's never felt rested a day in her life, I'm about to embark on a similar process to find out what's up. Maybe if I start digging I'll find a quick answer but who knows. I can sleep over fifteen hours in a day and still feel exhausted upon waking, and as a college student just getting to eight is almost impossible. I've dealt with this all my life but it's become such a burden that it's time I try and fix it. (Not that I haven't before, thyroid and iron tests have been run and, gluten has been cut out of my diet, all to no avail). ",2,0,1442006199,1444729705
cuyam9c,0,t1_cuxurcx,sammiedv,Sorry if you don't know but does your roommate have the typical associated narcolepsy symptoms such as sleep paralysis? Does she feel rested when awake? I can sleep over fifteen hours regularly and still feel tired upon awaking and as this is the first time I've heard of this type of narcolepsy I'm very interested. ,1,0,1442002332,1444729705
cuohrnd,0,t1_cuoh8en,sammiedv,A post about ISIS fighters not knowing anything about what they claim to be fighting for is anti-Islamic?  ,7,0,1441223482,1444729705
ctj229m,0,t1_ctj1ma7,sammiedv,"You don't have to take your phone; go on the walk, come home, sync steps, log the time and distance you walked (I find distance by going into day view for distance and looking how far it said I walked in the timeframe I was walking)",2,0,1438097053,1444729705
ctj0nl3,0,t1_ctiu1wc,sammiedv,"Your flex will sync without putting it into and then taking it out of sleep mode. You can log your walk after by putting in the time you walked and how far you walked under log workout, but even if you don't do this the flex is still tracking your steps and will give you active minutes if you're fast/active enough (it typically counts my brisk walk as active minutes whether I log it or not). There's no way to tell the Fitbit you're about to go on a walk/workout on the band itself as far as I know. ",2,0,1438094933,1444729705
