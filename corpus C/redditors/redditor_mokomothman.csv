others are 53 and still can't comprehend why people don't just rally behind us.

Its because they have that right to. The job as a serviceman/woman is glorified, and oftentimes misunderstood, even by our own brothers and sisters.

I am the president of a student veterans association, and I find a small number of the Veterans we serve with in our organization are pig-headed bigots who have no business interacting in day-to-day operations. We were recently asked by the advisor to the international student organization to have a pow-wow with them to discuss the difference in customs and courtesies between countries. A majority of this group is comprised of young, impressionable muslim teenagers from Bahrain, Algeria, Morocco, and the like. 

This individual, though he is not on the executive committee, maintained his position:

""I don't want nothing to do with *those people*.""

Whoa, man. We fought the war overseas, lets not bring that shit back home. It damaged all of us in one way or another. The least you could do is hold your tongue a bit, please...

The last thing I want to do as President is to allow the Group to deteriorate into a mass of congealed ignorant backwash...And yet, I feel like If I say something, I would be the only one...Problems, man.",1,0,1444689909,1444722298

Adding NEW legislation doesn't fix the problem. The laws emplaced already need only be enforced. How do you enforce these laws? You hire more ATF agents and educate the local law enforcement on how to properly prosecute gun crimes when they do occur.

The cost of a firearm is much cheaper than paying for a therapist for not only their time, but the prescriptions as well. And this is over time. Over time, the price of a therapist and medication will increase and decrease; right now its increased roughly 20%. This is the reason Obamacare shouldn't be repealed: People who cannot normally afford medical care can do so through the state if they didn't have a program to pay for it already. Medicare only provides so much, and the supplementation of it by ACA ensures people get the medical treatments and therapies they deserve and need.

On top of that, We must teach the population to genuinely speak WITH each other, not TO. Asking people how they're doing would make worlds of difference for those hurting. Another way to mediate this issue is to stop stigmatizing mental illness. We push these people away. They're PEOPLE, not PATIENTS. Telling them its okay to seek help and to voice their problems aloud should be encouraged. We should be willing to listen to them and point them in the right direction. I'm so tired of hearing the news stories about people dying by a series of events that has cascaded into a point of no return. We as Americans, As people, as members of an interconnected world must do something.

I propose we genuinely ask people we love and care about if they're alright; to ask those who look alone, afraid, unassuming, if they need anything.

This is why you lose so much support GOP. You make these dumbass statements condoned by your dumbass news channel's dumbass staff, and you make your entire dumbass base look like...well, dumbasses.

The abuse rate of Government aid, namely food assistance, is less than 5%. Its 3.7% or something last time I checked. That means 96% of beneficiaries are actually using the assistance for what it was designed for. You going to fault the 96 percent on something less than 4 percent do?
