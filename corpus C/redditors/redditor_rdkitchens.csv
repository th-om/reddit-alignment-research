cvxirba,1,t3_3o8lfd,rdkitchens,You also need to consider that how a person carries is in part due to there body type.  I carry low because I have a few extra pounds that are just in the way when carrying high.  ,1,0,1444692711,1444726744

But seriously, why the antagonism?  I asked an honest question about a YouTube personality based on limited knowledge.  Now I'm a nutjob.  This is the type of response I expect from r/firearms.",-1,0,1443664643,1444726744

cvjv4ng,0,t1_cvirpat,rdkitchens,"Do people take that Kickok guy seriously?  I ask because I was looking for reviews on a gun I considered buying and came across a Kickok video review.  In the middle of the video he stops, looks off into the distance and says, ""Hey look.  A terrorist.""  He then proceeds to pull his weapon and fire off into the distance.  I closed the video and wrote him off as a run of the mill nut job that wants to shoot people but can't join the military.  However, I've seen his name pop up rather frequently around here.  What gives?

cvivput,0,t1_cviuryg,rdkitchens,I think that's illegal.  I remember reading a story about a hotel that blocked cell phones from being able to hotspot in order to force people at a conference to pay for wifi access.  The hotel was sued and lost.  I think I remember that they lost because jammers are illegal.  Might want to double check that though.,56,0,1443581367,1444726744
