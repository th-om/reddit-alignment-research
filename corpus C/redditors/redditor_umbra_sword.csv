cvi5dct,0,t1_cvcp5no,umbra_sword,"Welcome, I am more than happy to share what I have seen and heard around here.  

The situation here is getting much worse, and until police take firmer action it will continue to get worse.   We are seeing a major uptick in violent crime and racially motivated incidences against whites. This spring, a white guy was attacked specifically because he was white on the Metrolink (*they asked him about MB, he said that he was exhausted and just wanted to read and they 'attacked him for MB'*).  Its a small amount of people doing it, but it makes it worse for everyone because you start being on edge and making different decisions.  

A restaurant in Ferguson that I go to a lot now has zero white people come to it, mainly because they don't want to come to our places of business since they don't feel safe.  I don't blame them, when the police have to operate in packs the bad guys have a field day.  Even when the 9 year old girl was shot, right after the police officer and her mother were crying in each other's arms, some thug started to shout about 'gutting pigs' when the shooting was a gang drive-by.  My parents have said that the racial tensions remind them of segregation with whites on one part of town and us on the other, only this time its not because of the law its because they are afraid of random attacks.  

Its actually really sad to see your hometown ripped apart over a justified shooting and watch people burn down their neighborhood because they are angry.  I honestly don't see how this will end without someone here taking a real stand against the crime or a surge in police that lasts for months.  ",2,0,1443540321,1444726304
cvcoovg,0,t1_cvclj6r,umbra_sword,"I am from Ferguson area, Oath Keepers aren't a crazy militia.  They were invited here to be in front of homes, businesses and buildings and they volunteered their time.  Last time we had rioting, the police abandoned us hard.  Homes burnt down, the mainstreet was looted and burnt, and people were rightfully terrified because of it.   

They aren't meeting unarmed protesters.  That's just a horrible misrepresentation of reality.   They held doors as you went into businesses, they greeted you with a smile, and their presence (*presence, not actions*) alone chased away some of the post-MB thugs that will stand in front of a gas station or store and harass everyone.   Peaceful protesters definitely had no issues, I saw protesters chatting with Oath Keepers.  Its the ones that are rioting and looting that will have an issue with Oath Keepers. 

Oath Keepers also never claimed to start a fight, they specifically stated that they will stay where they are.  The translation is simple, if you are going to try to start shit, riot and loot, do it away from them.   And this time, the rioting happened far away from them as rioters know that it won't go well.   They just hung out, which was awesome and they were very civil and calm.

I pointed out the numerous failings of the parroted list, especially that it doesn't address the questions asked.  You pretended that it didn't, claiming that since its all 'science' it has to be right and address the question. 

Now you are denying your source and pretending that you can't figure out the discussion.  This is just embarrassing, especially since you proclaim the issue is so vital and proven yet you can't formulate an on topic response. ",1,0,1443017918,1444726304

Things like 

""CO2 limits will hurt the poor""

are responded to with 

'Those who contribute the least greenhouse gases will be most impacted by climate change.""

Which ignores the thesis of the question that those in developing nations will be forced to dramatically slow their development while incurring hurdles that weren't placed on other nations as they developed.  While they aren't contributing much currently (*no clue how the fuck this is on topic*), they will contribute a vast amount in order to move from absolute poverty to decent middle class.

cvalo5f,0,t1_cva4lpl,umbra_sword,"Yes, the predictions have been embarrassingly wrong a lot.  They also fail to explain things that happened in the past.   Which is why its very hard to take their current predictions seriously.

I don't disagree that the climate is changing and we need to treat the environment better with less pollution, but the facts do not support the dire claims or even support the argument. 

Also, its pretty funny to see a pre-made list of parroted responses like that.   Its like ""Oh, they have a valid question?  Here is a slightly off topic response that will make them ask more questions and make you seem knowledgeable.""  If that doesn't work, just claim that *they* refuse to accept science and act smug, which is 99% of the responses you get on the topic.  

There are just massive holes that are not explained, coupled with the wildly off base predictions in recent years, that makes it very easy to question the validity of the 'science' behind it.  I do agree we have a lot of work to reduce pollution and should, but the science isn't as firm to make predictions or dire claims from a position of authority.

cv9w434,0,t1_cv9ux8r,umbra_sword,">Because it takes a massive amount of willful ignorance to believe that it isn't man made. In addition we can't fix it unless we agree that it is man made and address man made issues.

I have to ask, how can you be so certain when we have no proof of such?

Current models do not explain or even come close to explaining periods like the 1400 mini ice age or the warming period starting in the late 1700s.  We also have very poor data currently, as the predictions of the last twenty years have been embarrassingly wrong, from the absolute melting of the north pole's ice by 2014 to the half degree a year increase in temperature. 

I don't disagree that the climate is changing and pollution = bad, but we haven't proved out the majority of your stance.  Acting to reduce pollution is essential, no doubt.   ",3,0,1442897455,1444726304
