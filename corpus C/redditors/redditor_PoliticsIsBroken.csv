You're being purposely dense here. So all I will say if you can't see the difference between meeting with other heads of state as a sitting President and meeting with a special interest group as a presidential candidate, then I don't know what to tell you

> Then you seem to be claiming that Campa-Najjar has some kind of obligation to go easy on the man

He doesn't. Trump also has no obligation to meet with him either. Your blind rage against Trump seems profoundly misplaced in this matter.

>  he's lauded by yourself and those few others.

Please tell me where I 'lauded' Trump. I was simply pointing out this article's title and content are extremely questionable.

From our budget? How much money did you think it would cost? Think about this rationally. It wouldn't happen all in one day. It would over a period of several years. It would probably be 'expensive', but not relative to the total budget.

Maybe if you did it all at once, which is unlikely to happen.",3,0,1443886834,1444719729
