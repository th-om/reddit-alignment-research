It is also a position that no one else put her in except herself, so I don't really have too much sympathy for her privacy. Nor do I think it is a position she did not consider prior to setting up her own administered server-- I think it was very much calculated and there is evidence to support this. 

For someone who did all of the above I do not trust her judgment on what should and should not be read or considered personal. I do not believe it was a mistake in any way that she did what she did.

That being said I don't think there's a real scandal or anything. I just do not like the situation one bit nor does it to anything to gain my trust.",1,1,1444704947,1444719817

I'm no fan of the Saudi government, but I certainly do hope a regime change there, if it happens, is peaceful and doesn't disintegrate into another sectarian civil war. That is good for nobody.",3,0,1444340740,1444719817
cvszbb0,0,t1_cvswkkj,wemptronics,"That seems highly unlikely nor do I think it would fall under one of the few causes for NATO to actually execute a military action. It is simply a response to Russian escalation that's been detailed well in other parts of this thread. My uneducated guess is that this is a medium term action in the event Russian planes or backed Syrian forces get too aggressive near the Turkish border in the next few years. At this point in the conflict a NATO reaction force has no real impact other than posturing.

NATO troops attacking Peshmerga or YPG would be a disaster in more ways than one.",2,0,1444340311,1444719817
cvrazbe,0,t1_cvr7iex,wemptronics,"No he was being honest and I agree that Obama has given a face lift to the U.S. image in the world. Do you happen to remember where you saw that poll?

I think the TPP will do a lot for US interests, but do not under estimate China's economy and growing military influence. They will have hiccups for sure, but China's strength is certainly still growing. It will be difficult for the U.S. to deal without h Chinese regional aggression.

I'm not so sure warming relations with Cuba has much to do with Putin's foreign policy. Also, even if Putin's puppet in Ukraine is gone he still has reduced Ukraine to a broken state. He is doing a good job of moving the spotlight away from domestic problems.",6,0,1444229289,1444719817

cvkhlkj,1,t3_3n05mu,wemptronics,"LiesAboutKnowingYou is a moderator of /r/SyrianCivilWar and has made several threads such as this one where he has *heavily* researched a topic and tries to lay out the basics of it for everybody. 

* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/2vex9w/how_barrel_bombs_work_and_are_employed/) is one about barrel bombings that the regime uses. 

* And [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/38fbqi/how_to_stop_an_urban_svbieds_or_why_atgms_wouldnt/) one that details the tactics used for checkpoints and cities defending against VBIEDS (cars that go boom with bomb.)

* [One more about ATGMs (anti-tank weaponry) in Syria](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3f6o4v/atgms_in_syria_five_months_of_missile_strikes/)

* [A post about the rebel's use of homemade artillery and its evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3hdpn9/hell_cannons_from_minor_nuisance_to_major_threat/)

* [DepthHub worthy post on the mechanics, communications, and tactics involved operating mortars and artillery](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/2wl99p/mortars_how_they_work_and_what_a_trained_mortar/)

If I recall, and OP can correct me if I'm wrong, he is a veteran that is also studying the region in higher education. I'd recommend driving through his post history to get some good info if you are interested at all in the SCW and don't necessarily want to visit a subreddit every day to learn about it. That being said, the /r/SyrianCivilWar subreddit is one of the best moderated subreddits on this website and carries an abundance of information, sometimes horror, *and* even entertainment. It's a big melting pot for people on all sides of the conflict (even ISIS supporters) and as such it can get pretty crazy.",20,0,1443708837,1444719817
