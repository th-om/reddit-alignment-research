>a mutual-fund firm that wasn’t named sold 75,000 contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index known as E-mini futures -- worth about $4.1 billion -- using a computer program called an algorithm

A single trader *should not* be able to flash crash the market like that. The algos panicked after a traders actions. People F up all the time (we're human). A single human F up should not cause an almost 1,000 point flash crash. We humanly can't react that quickly to even do it. Therefore, it was definitely HFT algos that ""caused"" the flash crash.",7,0,1444251716,1444718474

>Members of the financial industry generally claim high-frequency trading substantially improves market liquidity, narrows bid-offer spread (**by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities**), lowers volatility and makes trading and investing cheaper for other market participants.

Emphasis is my added text to acknowledge your question above.

There's also something called [quote stuffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quote_stuffing) 

And [layering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layering_%28finance%29)

A lot of HFT's use proprietary algorithms as well based off of news events, movements in stuck prices (momentum), stock orders and god knows what else. So, as noted above, HFT's are very intricate and not simple trading instrument that can be described in layman's terms. I wouldn't even attempt to discuss HFT's on reddit with anyone because I simply don't have a solid understanding of how they work and what they do. ",3,0,1444251121,1444718474

We could go back and forth all day but the last thing I'll say is that governments and private corporations are inherently different. Technically, in the US which is a republic we elect lawmakers who essentially work for the people. If enough people wanted lawmakers to pass plain labeling for soda (like many people have been pushing for GMO's) we may see that. But let's take the GMO thing for a second. Regardless of if you think they're good or bad, let's assume 80% of the populace wants foods made with GMO's clearly labeled (either because they think GMO's are bad or are wary of the pesticides used in GMO's - not getting into that debate here). But it's the *will of the people of a sovereign state* to have that done. Now, some foreign company that uses GMO's comes and sues us and says ""You can't label our food as GMO because it may hurt our profits!""

To me it essentially boils down to democracy verse corporate lawyering. Don't like something? Well, don't worry about going through any legislative process, just go around the whole thing and sue the country. Go look up the *Metalclad v Mexico* case and see what you think about that. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalclad - All cases are not so cut and dry and as innocent as ""plain packaging"" and ""free speech"" 


Edit- plus don't forget the remainder of what's in the other chapters of the TPP that don't have anything to do with trade! E.g. IP law, internet traffic monitoring, basically making whistleblowing a crime, etc...",2,0,1444160608,1444718474
