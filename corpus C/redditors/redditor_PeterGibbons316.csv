For the 3* essential I like SWitch+Deadpool with the required character so that I can get those Deadpool points every day.",1,0,1444677756,1444721792
cvx33s7,0,t1_cvwzit7,PeterGibbons316,"I agree.

Yeah, your scaling is off because your best team is 180/167/154, and a team of 117s should be easy with that team, but you are trying to use a team of 94/94/94. Can't see the rest of your roster, but have you tried using Falcon/Loki/OBW or something like that?  You have Wolverine? Wolvie/Falcon/OBW would probably be pretty strong, or Daken maybe?",2,0,1444669504,1444721792
cvvknri,0,t1_cvv8xjw,PeterGibbons316,"> Hulk/PX/GSBW

You aren't winning with that team?  I went 6/6 in round 7 with it - most battles I won as soon as the CD tiles resolved and triggered Hulk's anger.",2,0,1444542270,1444721792
cvvaorg,0,t1_cvv369r,PeterGibbons316,"Honestly, the final progression reward should be SS, not just a legendary.  I have a small shot at earning it, but I have to win 20 of my final 24 battles with Galactus.....unlikely.",2,0,1444522243,1444721792
cvv8fyc,1,t3_3o8tjk,PeterGibbons316,"My biggest problem with this event is that it is the only event where you can actually get locked out of the progression rewards.  There is fixed maximum score, and every time you lose a battle with Galactus the points that you could have earned are gone, and you can never get them back.  This is the only event that has ever been like that.

It's causing people to force quit the game mid battle when they know they will lose so that they can have another shot at those points.",7,0,1444518029,1444721792
cvv3zoh,1,t3_3o96fb,PeterGibbons316,"If you read his abilities it tells you how much AP they generate.  I think they start at 2, then get as high as 4 in the later rounds (6 on up I think?)

Can't check right now either - locked out til 8 EST.",5,0,1444509727,1444721792
cvu39g6,0,t1_cvu1cgi,PeterGibbons316,"Scarlet Witch, GSBW, ProfX.

SWitch's blue generates purple and often a match-5.  You use GSBW's purple to create green match-5s which do a lot of damage with ProfX's blue, and happens to generate more purple AP (as long as his strongest color, blue, is less than Switch/GSBW's purple).  My ProfX is at 220 so that he generates purple AP instead of blue.  When he is boosted or leveled higher you can sub Mystique for SWitch and use her blue to create more purple and match-5s, but it doesn't work quite as well.",1,0,1444421697,1444721792
cvtzxo1,1,t3_3o40xm,PeterGibbons316,"Nice.  So far I'm 1 for 6 with Charlie's Angels.  I made it to turn 5 twice.  Once SWitch's CD tile went off in the corner, generated no AP, and I lost.  The other time it went off and let me fire off GSBW's purple leading to the win.

Why bring Punisher?  He didn't do much.  I'm wondering if there would be a better person there?  

edit:  For retribution?  Makes sense I guess if you have the red AP and have hit him with a SS or two.",2,0,1444416678,1444721792
