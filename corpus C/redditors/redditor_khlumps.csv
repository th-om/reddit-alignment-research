cvl33v2,0,t1_cvl275k,khlumps,"I think awa64 put it perfectly. Guns make it easy for crazy people to kill people, while taking that away makes it better for society as a whole. You do make a valid point in that this should allow the gov't to take away people's rights. Which is why the real argument is:

if gun's make it easier for people to die, why should it be a right?

People should really stop using the NRA's tagline of ""the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun"". It's really a circular argument advocating for the validity of the 2nd amendment using the 2nd amendment.

if your agument is to stop gov't tyranny, then i wont argue. But vehemently believing in allowing ppl to arm themselves for defence and not considering other alternatives, whether milder (like banning  assault weapons) or extreme (banning guns across the country) is just fundamentally dishonest IMO",6,0,1443741006,1444719487
cvg58sm,0,t1_cvg1uuh,khlumps,"Humor me for a moment. Say your scenario is true, would you not agree that maybe Bob didn't work hard precisely because he was middle class? Perhaps because his parents worked so hard to provide financial wellbeing, they neglected to provide discipline. I've seen from personal experience that poor people are much happier, more hardworking and better adjusted than rich people. Of course you may disagree, and that would be certainly valid to believe.

My problem with your argument is that you make assumptions about Alice and Bob which are inherently unfair. We don't punish Alice for being born in a economically deficient family, why do we punish Bob for being in a character deficient family?

Fair should be based on how much money someone has, not one how he/she got there, because we simply don't know that. By this definition, a progressive tax is definitely fairer

cpltl1n,1,t3_2zq8zy,khlumps,"I have a foolproof way that you can use to skip emperor and go straight to immortal

find your nearest neighbor and steal their worker
monument->shrine->barracks-> 4 archers-> 2 catapults
kill off this neighbor with those units, while continuing to spam archers in your capital. Raze all their cities and puppet the capital, build a National College in your capital 

annex all the puppets and make courthouses one at a time once you can afford the happiness

finish honor prioritize exp, dont let any units get killed.

declare war on the next nearest neighbor one at a time, your income will be negative so you will need to pillage repair tiles from razed cities. make sure your catapults survive long enough to get range, logistics etc. 

before, artillery, you should have all 7 capitals, on standard, immortal pangaea. Add more AIs or change the map for more fun, but the formula works 100%

Forget wonders, just take them from enemy cities
focus on science and gold in all your cities, 
build city connections so you can protect your empire 
since you'll be razing all non-capital cities, you can have a bunch of high pop cities without sacrificing science

If you haven't won the game yet, go for Autocracy and focus on hapiness and the army upkeep reduction policy, but your first policy is the double spy stealing. 

dont hesitate to declare war when you see errant settlers trying to plant cities between yours, if you can patrol a few knights/lancers between your cities to prevent settlers and barb spawning. 

liberate city states, wipeout civs, no mercy, dont give them a chance to recover

If you show them a corpse of their own kind they might get scared, but if they felt that despair, they should start acting up but they don't, IIRC",1,0,1426464635,1444719487
cpeo8q3,1,t3_2yzi3v,khlumps,"My philosophy is this, killing is not bad if what you kill can't feel despair. Despair is not the same as sadness or pain, because both of those are temporary. Even if it is immoral to pinch someone or punch someone or kick someone in the nuts, its a forgivable act because the pain is temporary, and not really all that bad. 

What makes it bad is the psychological effect on the person. Losing an arm probably isnt that physically painful compared to the sinking feeling of never being able to do things two-armed people can do

All the same, i believe animals feel pain not despair. They dont fear death to the same degree a person does when they both enter a slaughterhouse. If you make the death quick and relatively painless, its totally fine. This is of course only an opinion",0,0,1426344689,1444719487
