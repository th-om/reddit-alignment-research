cvuu44g,1,t3_3o5so7,Dr_Schaden_Freude,"TIL Vin Diesel is black?  And the lack of baselines in their charts is disturbing.  I'm not a movie exec, I don't know the industry averages and such so showing be charts of 'black data' only and telling me 'see it is trending down!' means nothing without some context.  Shit post that belongs in /movies not here",1,0,1444491408,1444725110
cvud8lw,1,t3_3o4olw,Dr_Schaden_Freude,"I used to work for a company that sold Div10 specialties primarily to GCs that bid on projects through McGraw Hill (and other platforms).  They employed this approach for a few years prior (call, record in a massive excel sheet, repeat) with a decent win rate. I know your situation is a bit different but there are a lot better engagement methods that could significantly raise your conversation rate.  PMs and construction companies in general get a million of these calls a day.  I'm not really sure where I'm going with this as I'm sure you guys employ more than this approach except to suggest looking into bidding platforms and spec dominance if you don't already...",1,0,1444439340,1444725110
cvsv009,1,t3_3nyufb,Dr_Schaden_Freude,This is a strategic move far beyond targeting Etsy.  Amazon has been quietly putting together a hardware accelerator division and this not only gets them Etsy esque sales but a pool of applicants to pick from to scale.  Pretty clever,4,0,1444334004,1444725110

cvrpobi,0,t1_cvrofox,Dr_Schaden_Freude,Being an outrage piece isn't exclusive.  Another theme would be screwing the system by losing morality.  Their orthodox and Jewish connections being another representative of the system which they rail against with a great amount of douche bag frat boy flair.,3,0,1444250773,1444725110
cvrkzon,0,t1_cvrc0su,Dr_Schaden_Freude,"I have a problem with their sales tactics as the terms of the ~~loan~~ cash advance often were not made clear at all to their customers using high pressure sales tactics, exploiting foreigners who didn't understand what they were getting into due to language barriers etc.  But as far as their business model goes I agree it's pretty sound",4,0,1444244027,1444725110
cvrkx2m,0,t1_cvqqtk6,Dr_Schaden_Freude,"I get the sarcasm of your quote but I would say your use of it is more anti-semitic than the author using their background as orthodox Jews to highlight the contrast of their upbringing and projected path to what they ended up doing... The fact that they were Jewish didn't have any bearing on me as a reader but other than to give framework  to the story.  A big part of Judaism used to be charging interest on money was a moral crime, and these guys made bank doing just that...  It wasn't at all ""look at the Jews screwing us!' as you imply and frankly the fact that you took it that way kind of reveals that was the first thing you thought about when he highlighted their Jewish background.",2,0,1444243925,1444725110
