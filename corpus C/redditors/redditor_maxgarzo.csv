But you'd never go completely out of your way to deprive these individuals of their right to identify as a woman, would you?

I feel like this is something constantly lost in these kinds of debates: preferences clash all the time, sometimes on very thick and clearly exposed lines of how one derives pleasure (sexual pleasure, pleasure of freely associating as trans-, pleasure of simply being who they want to be) from their station in life.  

Expressing how that clash makes you feel as a person, it seems is a big enough deal for some that they extrapolate this to the point of assuming ""incompatibility implies impropriety"" when it should be seen as a more charitable ""incompatibility is just non-preference"".

> I completely support the right for these individuals to transition or identify as whatever gender they feel, but I do not owe them a pity-fuck because of their predicament

Except replace the pity-fuck with 'soapbox'.  What I mean by that is, yep: I agree you have the right to identify and call yourself whatever you want, and I am in no position to tell you otherwise.  Just don't chide/scream at me for not automatically capitulating *my* preferences or opinions of *my* preferences *for* you.

 I get the same when certain ""SJW"" (or whatever) groups get mad about how something 'impacts' minority groups and start pulling aggressions out of thin air and I'm sitting here playing with my afro thinking ""Wow, I never knew I was supposed to be mad at that, are the same people telling me what to be offended by *really* the same people talking about the importance of 'agency'?
