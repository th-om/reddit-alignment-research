cv84hpz,0,t1_cv80g7v,openeyes756,"It was an absolute tragedy what happened to that officer, that being said it is a pretty isolated incident, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows in there recent numbers, not many officers are hurt/killed in the line of duty as many other professions such as garbage disposal. 

The officer's first remarks on the incident was that her crime was ""resisting arrest"" and changed his story to it was assault. What she did was disrespect his power move about the cigarette and he escalated it again and again after that to cause a situation to arrest her, as is shown by the fact he tried to charge her with ""resisting arrest"" which was simply disrespect, which is not a crime. 

Edit: if someone is not ""legally"" detainment it is kidnap, since he lied about what he charged her for and first assaulted her, he has no grounds to charge her.",4,0,1442774320,1444726424
cv846qg,0,t1_cv8201x,openeyes756,"I think you misunderstood me, I was saying we need many many more teachers and money devoted to the education system, an exponential need. But they need to be paid better and have more freedom to their curriculum as you're stating. We need more civil discourse in schools, I think that leads to a well informed populace as well.

As well as I see and agree with your point, I guess I more meant that they are currently distracted by a bunch of non violent offences and cannot do those things you're meantioning. ",2,0,1442773844,1444726424
cv7zy0k,0,t1_cv7xbqv,openeyes756,"Swearing in particular I've seen used in schools and small towns/big cities in Texas. That's just an example of a frustrating one to me, as many times as I've heard it threatened

Edit: Ultimately it's a little silly to have the law and be so vague as to when it's ticketable, but that's common with laws currently. They're so vague most people find themselves, be it unknowingly and innocently, breaking a law on a regular basis. It all depends on time and place as to weather or not it's you who is ticketed. 

P.S. Keep doing great work, I appreciate your dedication as well as your willingness to talk to people reasonably and respectfully!",1,0,1442767452,1444726424
cv7wyl9,0,t1_cv7sap8,openeyes756,"That would be pretty unfortunate for someone to lose their job over swearing in an interaction with someone. However, I think it would be perfectly acceptable for that officer to be written a ticket for vulgar language in public, as can be written for a regular citizen. That's a case where there is still a law broken, that other people would be charged for, where an officer gets off without a scratch. 

Simply charging them the same is a great place, if the laws are on the books and are used against citizens, you have to apply it every time an officer applies it. See a fellow officer swear in public? A ticket should be written so he goes through the same process as someone else who broke a law, on top of whatever the department decides as far as their job is concerned. 

If you unleashed the same tools on your fellow officers to keep them in line it would be great. $150 for that ticket would send me several weeks behind in paying bills. That's my deterrent, cops should be expected to pay out of their pocket when they break a law as well. ",1,0,1442761885,1444726424
cv7w2r0,0,t1_cv7ucem,openeyes756,"We do not having a growing demand for more and more law enforcement though. Violent crime and highway patrol for reckless/intoxicated people are the only need we have for officers. 
Teachers, however are always going to be needed at the rate of exponential increases in data available to teach young people today. In teaching, learning and researching we find ways that cost us less money to deal with the problems police currently have in protecting our society. 

That is in no way belittling their job, but massive misuse of funds on things that assault rifles, armored hummers and tanks, are not required to complete that end (maybe a few rifles though, reasonably.) 

The War on Drugs has been a huge focus of police organizations for decades, with funding tied to drug busts in a never ending supply chain. The American people are quickly gaining the opinion that this is a poor use of funding and time by their police and federal agencies. I believe when officers are freed of trying to be babysitters going ""No, little 30yo, you can't play with that"" is ridiculously wasting time and our resources to house the really terrible, violent offenders that truly can't be useful in society, but the money and resources procured to house/feed/care for inmates of drug crimes could be much better used on rehabilitation centers/research to get these people in the swing of being useful, productive members of society that the rest of us enjoy being. 

Properly allocating our time and resources will find us better answers to the problems we have than ""stick people in jail"" or ""fine them"" and continue using those laborers and not seize up the flow of money through the economy.",0,0,1442759288,1444726424
cv7ugvl,0,t1_cv7ts0z,openeyes756,"I feel like this is untrue, the cops are trained with an idea of what the criminals they are looking for will likely look like. The cops see it through Smokey glasses themselves and perceive threats that are not threats as in the cases of innocent people I mentioned in my post. The law as it stands today can make pretty much anyone a criminal, all depending on time, place and chance. This isn't necessarily inherently wrong, but the punishment should always fit the crime and ""disrespect"" (which, anyone knows means vastly different things to different individuals) is not reasonably punishable by death. [Just as an example, there's no need for rudeness out of officers like this](http://thoughtsonliberty.com/how-to-go-from-citizen-to-criminal-in-under-10-minutes) 

As citizens of a democratic republic, we have every right to complain about how our government officials and the laws affect our lives in order to improve them ""In order to make a more perfect union,"" as the Union is never perfect, but it can always be better and better.

I have many family friends, family, and friends of my own in the police force, I can understand and sympathize with them. That doesn't mean I approve of every move they make. When you are in a position of power I believe you have to maintain outstanding moral resolve and compassion for people, not harbor hatred and think of them as ""scum"" when you come across someone because you assume violence will come from anyone and everyone. 

If you agree with that view, then you should be in favor of the common public seeing officers as ""scum"" when they see unarmed people shot, because they never know which officers are willing to take a life without real threat being taken towards them. Personally, I don't think that's the answer. We need a restructuring of laws so that it serves the actual interests of the people, not used as a tool to lock any of them away.",8,0,1442754302,1444726424
cv7tmm5,0,t1_cv7tauz,openeyes756,"Oh, by no means do I think that commenter I replied to was being racist, just dissociated from the reality of mirror neurons recognizing ""me"" when he sees black people, as it is easier to build barriers when you aren't surrounded by diversity for formative years, not impossible to be young now and dissociated in the same way/old and be empathetic for all people. 

In the interview Joe Rogan had with the ex baltimore lieutenant Micheal Wood, Micheal showed some stark differences that he felt like he had gained by having true discipline from the marine corps in the term of when to even draw his weapon that he largely did not see in the police around him who weren't veterans. I love the idea of having police in a high esteem, where everyone feels like they can call for help when they need it without fear of scaring some officer on the edge accidentally, leading them to get shot. I would fully support much better wages and benefits for our boys and girls in blue to meet these goals, as I think we should take care of those who offer their lives in service of the public. They just need to be fully in service of the public. ""customer-service policing"" meaning when someone has a problem, they help address that issue and don't waste time scouring for non-violent offenses just to profit off the public they serve.",3,0,1442751486,1444726424
cv7t3t7,0,t1_cv7rxbd,openeyes756,"Have you ever lived in the inner city? You can call the police all day, every day already and get no officers to respond so that wouldn't be new (in some areas). 

I think the officers need to hear you're side of the citizens as well, when there are many police stations being investigated by the DoJ for excessive disproportionate patrolling and tickets written for regular, non violent offenses that just cost a lot of money to the impoverished. 

Baltimore turned out to be a perfect example of this, with ex officers of baltimore police departments coming out and talking about the abuses of power and institutional racism basically drove policy. ",18,0,1442749387,1444726424
cv7syfh,0,t1_cv7r53n,openeyes756,"That blog had a good point, except for the fact that she changed lanes to avoid being tailgated by the officer (a commonly seen tactic here in Texas) so I can completely understand her utter frustration with being pulled over in the first place. 

That cigarette is not a weapon in tons of other cases, for example at music festivals one is never required to extinguish a cigarette when officers are present and there's hundreds of them around, cops are outnumber more than 20:1 and could easily be ""assaulted"" with those cigarettes. They never try to claim something so normal is a weapon until they are harassing someone. She knew she was being harassed. 

So its fine for a police officer to fight someone because they feel endangered, but when they literally kidnap someone and put them in a cage, that's just something you're supposed to expect from any minor infraction. The cop should have well known that this individual just needed a warning and get the interaction over with, but he was looking for a situation and he escalated it with a non violent indivual. It just happens to be legal for them to instigate violence and perceive it anywhere to feel like cowboys. 

Here in Texas I've had several cops divulge to me that they think there's people just looking to murder them, they are strung out and amped up on this ridiculous notion and it leads to people being jailed and killed who do not deserve to die just to get them into custody (only for nonviolent crimes, of course go after a rapist, murder, or violent assaulter with this sort of force, but non violence should not be met with that when a ticket/warning would have been reasonable.

cv7snjg,0,t1_cv7rbnz,openeyes756,"This is in no way to be disrespectful, as you wrote an incredible response but I want you understand one thing. That dissociation you have to black people is not universal. Many of us younger kids have diverse families and know people of every color that we bond too. You at one time learned that dissociation to help you deal with the society you grew up with. Today, those feelings aren't the same. I see my cousin getting shot when I see some kid get killed with his hands in the air, after he called the police, as in the case of Ricardo Diaz Zeferino. The same feeling went through my head when I heard the story of Zachary Hammond, a white kid shot in a drive thru because police thought he was a drug dealer, if I remember the autopsy showed he was shot in the back. These all resonate with young people, because we know friends in these situations who we know don't deserve to lose their lives for not simply obeying every asinine order given by police. Police should learn when their lives are in danger and when they're not and probably handle each individual situation, or get out of the job. ",4,0,1442747389,1444726424
