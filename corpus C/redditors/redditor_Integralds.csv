> I understand that journals aren't charities. But when so much is on the line, it is unacceptable for the peer review process to be as poor as it is. The process should more or less work. It should more or less fulfil the moral obligations to authors and to the discipline. Reviewers should not take 6-12 months to review an article. Editors should not use incompetent or overly hostile reviews as an excuse to keep the journal's rejection rate at 95%. Reviewers should not backtrack on their own opinions. Journals and referees may not be charities, but they do have some moral responsibilities to the author and to the discipline. Unfortunately, the peer review process does not work to fulfil its obligations. ",5,0,1444701433,1444728492
cvxo1aq,0,t1_cvxjxk7,Integralds,"> Should the government make cuts to public spending in order to reduce the national debt?

Probably not at current margins.

> Should Wall Street executives be criminally charged for their roles in the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis?

If you can find a specific law they violated, then go nuts with it.

> Should the government increase the tax rate on profits earned from the sale of stocks, bonds, and real estate?

No.

> Should the government decrease military spending?

Yes, at current margins. There is probably scope for a 10-15% reduction in military expenditure before you'd really cut into deployment effectiveness.

> Would you support increasing taxes on the rich in order to reduce interest rates for student loans? 

I think money is more fungible than this question permits.

> Should the government fund space travel? 

Sure, why the heck not.

> [Facebook paid £4,327 corporation tax in 2014]

> Yup, self-employed here and I paid more tax. Absolute bullshit that they're allowed to get away with this, and it's even more annoying that we're always fobbed off with the same excuses of ""something is being done"" to prevent it from happening again. Facebook paid no tax in the UK prior to 2014, and now they've paid just £4,327 into the system. Think of how much money this country has missed out on from them in those years.
