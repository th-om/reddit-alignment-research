cvvjfcy,0,t1_cvvi5qr,DeafDumbBlindBoy,"The GOP has had months to frame the ""debate"" by pushing further and further to the right. The Democrats haven't said or done anything as a group to refute this, but they will at their debates. 

By then, they will have all sorts of wiggle room for policy ideas and platforms. Most importantly though, because the Republicans have pushed so far into the fringes of the far right-wing, the Democrats will be able to effectively start even from a right of center position and appear perfectly reasonable to a majority of voters. 

And **that** is what the Republicans have bought with all their campaign money. Insurance for the corrupt system that most voters are thoroughly disgusted by. Hillary can run as a ""true"" centrist candidate, appear sane in comparison, and then she'll just appoint the same types of scummy deregulators that Obama did. ",7,0,1444539143,1444726808
