cv1iuo6,1,t3_3kxaf7,bluejay89,"I think Obama's real struggle has not been with Republicans but more generally moving public opinion to his side, and thereby forcing the opposition to bend. Contrast him with Reagan and Clinton, both of whom were much more effective at gaining broader public support for their agenda (and more effective at personal relationships with opposition legislators) and were able to use this power to accomplish things with opposition Congresses. Obama's signature achievements - the recovery plan, healthcare, and now the Iran nuclear deal, have or will be approved on largely party line votes, which I suspect make them more vulnerable in the long run.",7,0,1442261762,1444725583
