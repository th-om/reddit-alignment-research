A month ago, I was coming home from work at about 5 PM. The sun was right overhead and I had just crested a hill, started to head down it and did not release the cars in front of me were breaking hard. The sun had compleatly washed out their lights (ever have someone with no break lights stop fast in front of you? Its hard as hell to tell right away). The car in front of me (in front of him/her was a car turning) had veered off onto the shoulder, I drove through the ditch, around that car through a handful of bushes and then I turned back toward the road, which left me stuck in a ditch between a tree and a mailbox. I credit me being a big time gamer to having the reaction speed and able to keep calm enough to see the tree, mailbox and car going off the road in front of me. Luckily for me I dodged both cars, and the only damage was my front bumper getting pushed up and the brackets getting a bit fucked by hitting the ditch (Mustang convertibles don't make the best off roaders...). I had to get a tow truck to winch my car out, but there was no mechanical damage so I just drove home. I have been to busy to take it to a body shop, I'm planning on doing it this weekend.

This was my first real accident (otherwise I had a parking lot fender bender and a cop rear ended me while I was on my drivers permit) and I got this car (2000 mustang convertible) in 2008, my first car.",5,0,1444697086,1444716298

But its also a space gun, so definitely.",2,0,1444685951,1444716298
cvxduzq,0,t1_cvxdtz1,Sollexs,">I am in no way trying to bar these people access to guns.

Yet all of the laws proposed by the anti-gun crowed do just this, and have no effect on other people.

>The problem is that there is a segment of the population that does not treat them as tools and dangerous weapons. People leaving firearms on coffee tables or in purses so they're kids gain access to them. Or walking around with their firearm loaded and having it accidentally go off. This is the segment of the population who treats them as toys.

That is just stupid people, you can look at any other product, dangerous or not, and find the same thing, dangerous use of items which end up harming others.

The other problem is how do you spot the stupid people from those who had grown up around guns? Then there is also the problem that most people can be trained on the use of firearms in a 10 minute talk (I have done this several times before a range trip to my non gun owning friends. I usually show them a handgun, unloaded, and show them how to operate it without actually loading it and getting them to do the same, before we move over to the range and fire it.) I have been shooting since I was 5, yet have no professonal training, and I was even able to out shoot a cop with his own gun. Having someone like myself go through a training class would be a waste of money and time (unless it was some kind of advanced training), yet how does one differentiate myself from Joe, who has only learned how to buy the glock he bought at the gunstore and fired it once?

As an aside, I keep a loaded gun in my desk, but I have no children and everyone I live with knows its there and its loaded. It's a just in case thing that I hope I never need.

I would also like to note that even military personal have negligent discharges (Accidental shooting) and they are trained quite a bit.",1,0,1444684945,1444716298
