$140 a week Divided by 4 people = $35 a person. $35 divided by 6 days = $5.83 per day per person. Sounds good to me. 


Now.... $5.83 per day plus a $3.00 delivery charge = $8.83 per day. Add on a 20% tip @ $1.77 = $10.60 You got  a deal!!! 

Special Instructions: Cut the brats into slices and stick those toothpicks with the colored streamers in them. Like they do with the samples at Sams Club.  And cut the Pork Tenderloin slices into the shape of a T-Rex please. Thank you so much. 

P.S. I'll make it easy on you. No need to make three deliveries per day. Just deliver the main meal about 6:00 pm and make sure you include the ingredients for breakfast and lunch. I'll cook them myself the next day. 

I'll PM you my address OK?",-15,0,1444703132,1444720707
cvxkzkv,0,t1_cvxgm25,FLSun,Well the solution is clear. We need to start arming our preschoolers. If Pampers had a built in quick draw holster our babies could be packing Glocks. Fisher Price is missing out on a big market here. Moms could start saving those Gerber baby food labels and get Jr. his first child size AK47.,-1,0,1444696326,1444720707

Deuteronomy 14:8:

The pig is also unclean; although it has a divided hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses.


I guess not touching their carcass applies to not only your hands but your penis also. ",3,0,1444614915,1444720707

cvwadvz,0,t1_cvw7je1,FLSun,"Can I ask you: What makes you think you are given a choice? 

You claimed to be a ""Computer Scientist"" earlier, correct? And your field of study is based almost entirely on the Electromagnetic Theory. In fact if the Electromagnetic Theory did not exist, then your field would not exist, correct? 

Now, considering that you think that we have the right to accept or reject Scientific Theories at will, what would you say if I told you that I do ""NOT Believe"" in the Electromagnetic Theory? Do Computers and electronics and magnets cease to operate just because I chose not to believe in the Electromagnetic Theory? Does the Theory become false because I chose not to believe in it? 

Of course not. My ""Belief"" or ""Lack of Belief"" has absolutely no bearing on the Theory whatsoever. In reality I don't get a choice. And neither do you. 

When it comes to Peer Reviewed Scientific Theories supported by mountains of evidence we no longer have a choice to accept or reject them. The evidence has taken that choice away from us. 

Do I ""Believe"" in the Theory of Evolution? Absolutely not!!! I studied the evidence until I gained the **Knowledge** that it is true and factual. I no longer have a ""Belief"", I have Knowledge. Just like you studied the evidence for the Electromagnetic Theory until you gained the Knowledge that it is true and factual. You realize that it would be impossible to change your position and claim that you no longer believe in the Electromagnetic Theory so therefore it is false. ",2,0,1444602450,1444720707

cvw3168,0,t1_cvw2cs9,FLSun,"His position on those issues demonstrate that either:

A. He is being willfully ignorant. And that is not a trait that is suitable for a leader of a Country. We cannot afford to have a leader who will ignore the facts just because they do not suit his erroneous whims. Nothing good can come from that position. Nothing.

B. He is intentionally lying through his teeth to pander to a group of people. And who would vote for a person who they know is dishonest? Do you really want to be lied to? 

So tell us, Why you would vote for a person who is either denying reality or lying to your face just to gain the votes of a group of people who are ignorant to the facts? 

Putting everything else aside forget about his education, his positions on the other issues and tell us why you would want a Proven Liar, or a Proven Fool? What is the upside of supporting such a candidate?",1,0,1444590982,1444720707
