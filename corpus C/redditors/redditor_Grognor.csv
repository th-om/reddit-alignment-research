cvwamfz,0,t1_cvvv1o1,Grognor,"Frankly I suggest stopping at tome 3. IIRC tome 4 (and maybe 5) aren't too slow-paced but once you read them you're in for the long haul, and there's a slow part of the series for a few books before you reach tome 11, and then it becomes super awesome again until the end.

Why?

It IS relevant either way because people identify or not based on what they think those labels mean. ",5,0,1443239079,1444726680
cveh6od,0,t1_cvebu16,Grognor,">they are more commonly the generic non-religious or agnostic. They don't really care either way, probably don't think about it as much, (not withstanding the occasional philosophical agnostic) and just go with the flow.

That's still technically an atheist. Agnostic and atheist are not mutually exclusive. Atheism is the lack of belief in a god, nothing more. You don't have to be convinced that there is no god (though you obviously can be), just not believe that there is one.

cvddgsy,1,t3_3m96kf,Grognor,"Default unless the default really sucks. 

Goes back to when I was playing consoles. I'd get really good at my own mapping, then go over to someone else's place and suddenly suck at the game (can't always remap when passing the controller around). 

Also if I end up playing a game i can't remap (and frankly I play anything from AAA to kongregate free games, so it happens) it pays to have learnt conventions. 

So it's usually WASD and whatever is standard at the time for me. ",2,0,1443150709,1444726680

cv5ilg3,0,t1_cv4uzpp,Grognor,"I think battles are ok. I don't believe you need to pay that much attention to them, and I think that helps shift the focus elsewhere. If you really want to, you can go deep to shift things in your favour, but other than retinues and sometimes mercs you rarely have that much to do that isn't obvious (defend on a mountain/hill and accross a river/straight, with the best generals you can find).
