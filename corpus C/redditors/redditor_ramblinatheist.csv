The argument is that the fetus does not have a right to life (which requires the use of the woman's body) above and beyond the woman's right to bodily autonomy. This argument is especially true if the fetus does not have personhood and has no claim to this right to life.",6,0,1444530047,1444730749

cvniwkl,0,t1_cvngf25,ramblinatheist,"Exactly! Methodological naturalism is not the assumption that there is only the natural and physical, it is the admission that the only things that we can reliably examine and probe are the natural and physical. Methodological naturalism does not at all rule out that we could discover something supernatural or nonphysical by probing the natural and physical. This is just like how in particle accelerators (and really most of physics and practically all of science) we are limited by our ability to measure photons (we can only measure electro-magnetic fields) but we can demonstrate the existence of the strong and weak forces and gravity (space time curvature).

Thats the thing most opponents of common core don't understand. They are teaching them to understand the standard algorithm rather than just teaching them to memorize the standard algorithm, which is what people were taught for years and why they can only apply an algorithm and don't understand the math behind arithmetic.

That's what many clerks around the country are doing, and it is one of the outs she was given in the court order that she was jailed for violating.

curzjvo,1,t3_3jr0o9,ramblinatheist,"There are similarities, but the difference is the important part and why one was sent to jail and one wasnt.

Both of them were found to have broken the law. Both of them appealed these rulings. Both of them were issued court orders to either do their job in the way laid out by the law or resign. 

The difference is that Newsome followed this order and went back to preforming his job in the way laid out by the law. Kim Davis ignored the court order. She is being held in contempt of court for violating a court order. Newsome was not held in contempt of court be cause he did not violate a court order. 

So the comparison fails where the people making it need it to succeed, where Davis is sent to jail. Both received court orders to follow the law, but only Davis ignored this and this is the reason she is in jail.
