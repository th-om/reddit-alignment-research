cvterwz,0,t1_cvtdypa,BernardSamson,"I suppose. Although in both examples I always figured the basic idea is what are the rights an individual has over their bodies and sexual activity. Not that it matters, I was asking because your original assertion was that the west values Individual rights over collective rights. I was having trouble thinking about what you could have meant by that. Is there a more contemporary example that comes to mind?",1,0,1444367699,1444728964
cvtdc8e,0,t1_cvt59r2,BernardSamson,"I'm happy that you've been responding to as much as you have in this thread. It's been very illuminating. But I don't understand how you can possibly think that ""Homosexual rights, abortion rights, et al are not individual rights"". Is it possible that we central Canadians are not writing off western Canadian thought because of where it comes from, but rather because of morally charged examples of that nature?",2,0,1444364187,1444728964

cvcq4gs,1,t3_3m6llv,BernardSamson,"I think the issue with that question is that it is almost by definition an essentially contested concept (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentially_contested_concept). Given your worldview it will mean very different things, and none of these interpretations are really compatible with each other. Additionally, any difference of opinion is seen as a moral failing or an expression of ignorance. Although if we're being honest, the term has been somewhat monopolized recently by certain universities undergraduate subcultures (for better or for worse depending on your outlook).",5,0,1443113338,1444728964
cv1mhzy,1,t3_3kxjxf,BernardSamson,"This is more of a tendency in thought rather than a explicit opinion. I happen to be more liberal, but I find myself frustrated with many people I would normally agree with when I keep having to say the terms ""on average"" or ""statistically"" when talking about certain things. I'm not sure if conservatives are much better, but I anecdotally find they are able to separate their values from from their positive statements about the world. As an example Cultural or Social conservatives believe in the nuclear family as a moral good and thats where their analysis ends. Liberals may believe in a more open view of family and gender roles (as I do) but refuse to accept statistics indicating that this view may have practical issues. They don't seem to understand that the reason they disagree with conservatives is because they have different moral codes, not different evidence. ",1,0,1442267424,1444728964
cv1ez9c,0,t1_cv1awom,BernardSamson,Thank you very much! I went from math to finance and my econ education is an ever-growing patchwork of books and other non-interactive material. It's so much easier when an actual human being explains something I find-taking the time to write and explanation means a lot. ,3,0,1442255891,1444728964
cv1alte,0,t1_cumix8b,BernardSamson,Later in the books there is a similar(-ish) system to what we have now with banking and a free market in which the firms are mostly co-ops. I think the eco-economics he talked about was a response to how in earlier stages of colonization most economic activity went directly into creating a livable environment. ,2,0,1442249166,1444728964
