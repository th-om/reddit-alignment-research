cvvsx4c,1,t3_3o915c,ironpete,I don't think he ever had a chance. His first win in New jersey was up against a very unpopular Jon Corzine and the second win was against a very weak opponent also. His calculated brashness and tough guy act got old to a lot of people pretty quickly and then there was all all the bridgegate and other ugly political maneuvering showed him to be pretty much a lowlife that probably wouldn't sell nationwide.  ,1,0,1444573034,1444721222

cvsu7kr,1,t3_3o04b1,ironpete,I think Obama will have a significant impact on the global stage after his presidency. He is relatively young and will be around for a long time. He may even earn that Nobel  Peace Prize he already received. I don’t think he will be shackled down by any government job.
