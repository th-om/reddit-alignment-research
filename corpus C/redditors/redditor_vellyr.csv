I doubt it was released outside Japan, but it's the only movie I can remember regretting. The anime was awesome, but the live action movie was ridiculous.",2,0,1444516222,1444724800
cvr26wv,0,t1_cvr1ket,vellyr,"Ordinarily, でいる and である are shortened into a copula, but they're actually just the particle で and the verb ""to be"". So Xでいる is just ""to be in X state"".

Why would you break them apart? I think it's mainly to draw a distinction between present and future.

私はそういうつもりだ
I have that intention

私はそういうつもりでいる
I will have that intention (from now until something changes my mind)

Splitting the copula is also necessary when you want to use an ending on ""be"".

Anyway, I'm not basing this on anime, I'm basing it on my 5 years living in the country and interacting with children on a daily basis. Most of the little boys use 俺 because they want to sound tough. Most of the male teachers use 僕.",2,0,1444106757,1444724800

cvoxato,1,t3_3nhe9j,vellyr,"I feel like done correctly, some developer could just do away with fetch quests and kill quests entirely and set up some sort of dynamic market to fill the gap. They never have engaging stories, so they shouldn't really count as ""content"". 

I say why not just roll them all together into a rich system in the world that players can interact with at their leisure. Depending on the town, the weather, the season, and a variety of other factors, you could have a certain demand for certain goods, and you could even include crafted items in this. So you see that wolf pelts are selling high in town X, so you go hunt down some wolves and kill them. There's no need to include some bullshit about how their howling is keeping a no-name NPC up at night, unless there are actual consequences for him not getting sleep. There's no reason for him to give you wolf-skin underpants, why do all these NPCs just have piles of pants lying around? Would you just wear pants that some random dude gave you?
