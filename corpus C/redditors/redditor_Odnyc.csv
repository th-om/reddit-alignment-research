Moreover, that wealth is not uniformly distributed among the elderly, and there are millions who rely on Social Security and Medicare to survive. These programs represent a social contract for all Americans. A guarantee of some sort of subsistence pension at the least, as well as health care. Considering how poorly most Americans are prepared for retirement via private means such as 401ks and the like, I would argue that Social Security is as vital as ever. Perhaps a return to guaranteed, private sector defined benefit pensions would change that, but defined contribution helps no one but corporate America's bottom line, and has been terrible for ensuring retirement security for Americans.

cvx6vaa,0,t1_cvwdyrp,Odnyc,"I think it's juvenile and irresponsible to undermine the negotiating position of the President of the United States, who has a Constitutional mandate to conduct foreign policy, to score cheap political points. Those concerns could have been communicated privately to State and the President just as effectively. The letter was a cheap piece of political theatre that made the United States look foolish.

cvx6pkg,0,t1_cvx197q,Odnyc,"There is certainly some debate about the effects of Roosevelt's policies on the depression, but most economists agree that the new deal significantly contributed to the recovery (helped along, after 1940, by WWII). Almost all economists agree however, that Mellon and Hoover's fiscal policies made the depression worse, and are textbook examples of what not to do in a recession/depression. 
As for Iraq, I challenge you to name one serious geostrategic error by the united States with the same magnitude of effects that the Iraq war has produced for the U.S. (at such a high cost) 

If you want to debate that's fine with me, but keep the snarky condescending ad hominems out of it. ",0,0,1444674736,1444720779

At any rate, it was both more responsible and a better ROI for the country than the Trillions spent by the previous administration to give tax cuts to the wealthy and fund a war we should have never fought (that fucked up the region horribly, and was probably the biggest strategic error by a U.S. President EVER.)",0,0,1444665311,1444720779

cvvy81z,0,t1_cvuvhpj,Odnyc,"Social security was designed to reduce poverty, actually. Prior to SS, the age group with the highest poverty rates were the elderly, who were basically fucked unless they had children to support them. It's designed to provide a bare level of subsistence. So, on that note the entire intent was to have wealthier workers subsidize poorer ones, to an extent. That is a noble goal, and there is nothing wrong with that. ",1,0,1444583490,1444720779
