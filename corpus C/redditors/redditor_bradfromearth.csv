cvwmrbm,0,t1_cvweiod,bradfromearth,That has to be it... Most logical answer so far. Lesson learned for me. Lost roughly 600$,1,0,1444625588,1444722075
cvwbpo2,0,t1_cvvc39w,bradfromearth,I agree and recognize that. I have such a hard time with this one because it is a net negative. Fines and expenses for unethical business with nothing of any value gained. Straight up loss.......I guess I have to settle with markets are not always rational.,1,0,1444604734,1444722075
cvt541i,0,t1_cvt0zbe,bradfromearth,IT'S STILL MONEY.  business is to make money not lose it. ,1,0,1444350085,1444722075
cvt3ypz,0,t1_cvt206r,bradfromearth,No shit man. Fucking drag. Lost 700 with that bad news is good news shit. Lesson learned I guess. ,1,0,1444348099,1444722075
cvt0zkt,1,t3_3nztb2,bradfromearth,"The Saudis control the price of Oil. No one has more Oil than the Saudis. They are/were trying to kill of US Shale in retaliation for US negotiations with Iran (their enemy). Now the tables have turned. Russians invited the Iranians to Syria and that freaked out the Saudis. Now they have the weaker hand and they know it. Notice the order of things here.  Russians move on Syria, Russia invites Iranian ground troops. OPEC announces cuts, which the US has asked them to do several times and each time they refused.


Obama has turned on our allies in Saudi Arabia and Israel and now cluster fucked the middle east. This may very well salvage some of the US Shale players although that is NOT the intent. The intent is to be in better with the US in the event they need our military support and (if any) influence we may now have with Iran.


In Syria we have a big cluster fuck that will likely become a hot war involving the US soon enough. 

With the prospect of War right where main arteries of Oil are AND OPEC cutting AND US Shale cutting production.  But if the cluster fuck in Syria goes away AND the Iranian negotiations hold. Look for a drop again once Iranian Oil hits the markets.

Anyway IMO....

cvsnusf,0,t1_cvsm71v,bradfromearth,"I got in in the aftermarket. I expected this to drop much harder. I am exiting with a slight loss (most likely) and switching to long put options. I don't mind options loss as much as a regular loss and this is not what I expected.


I think the consensus seems to be - They got a new CEO and he is ""cleaning up"" so this is good. Whereas if the former CEO was there and this happened the sentiments would be different. Unless they have Market Cap to the moon 7 billion is a gargantuan loss that in my mind is catastrophic and shit like this never happens in isolation. ",1,0,1444323652,1444722075
cvsnk8h,0,t1_cvsn6sa,bradfromearth,Nothing groundbreaking has ever come from using Mice as controls. All it does is provide information and give possible indications as to what might happen in human controls. If it fucks up mice no one is going to do a human study.,1,0,1444323214,1444722075
cvs2zw2,0,t1_cvs28u5,bradfromearth,"I have studied this and read tons of books over the last year and it is only a matter of time. I do think it will be a stair step kind of decline. I suspect artificial intelligence helping them goose the markets. I forgot which book where I read about it but there were some guys working on software to trade like a trader and not like an algo (meaning specialized). They gave this machine some money and let it go. They almost pulled the plug right before the crash when the thing started selling and reallocating like mad. They let it ride and it had predicted the crash of 08. Then it did a similar freak out again and yet again they let it ride. It predicted the bottom as well. 


This was back in 08-09. 6 years is an eternity in the software world. It is in a book so the powers that be are aware of it and with all the computing power at the NSA I am almost certain they have help. The way the market bounces around is just uncanny at times. Like last Friday for instance.

BTW deutsche bank announced taking a 7 billion loss in Q3. Shits getting turbulent fast.",1,0,1444272548,1444722075
