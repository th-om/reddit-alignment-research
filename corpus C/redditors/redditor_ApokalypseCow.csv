> Atheists build a box around themselves keeping God out with only themselves inside.

This ""box"" is called **reality**.  It contains that which we can objectively and empirically observe and verify.  It does not contain the claims of religion, because they fall into one of two categories:

1) That which is not evidently true.

2) That which is evidently not true.",36,0,1444664297,1444730760

There may be situations where you don't have a concealed weapon and find yourself regretting its absence.

Then, send in the Rogue/Ninja, once the enemy has been conditioned to not look too closely at anything, and let the stealth assassinations begin.",6,0,1444610855,1444730760

Besides, what do I need another AR for, I've got 3 AR-platform rifles as it is!  The Bushmaster in 5.56, the .300 Blackout, and the 6.5 Grendel.  I'm not going up to a .50 Beowulf or .458 SOCOM.

I mean, sure, I *guess*  I could make rail-top 5.56 rifle, since I don't want to frankengun the Bushmaster with it's carry-handle top...  but no, I don't need another 5.56 either, 'cause with the FS2000 I've already got 2 of them.

cvsweo9,0,t1_cvsut9k,ApokalypseCow,"The focus is on the Chief as a character rather than just a vehicle for the player since Halo 4 (and arguably even before then), and I can't fault them for wanting to make him less 2-dimensional.  The Halo universe is rich with back story and intrigue, and the single player campaigns are there to tell a story in that universe.  You can't tell a good tale without good characters in it, irrespective of the player's agency - if you try, you end up with a protagonist like Gordon Freeman, who the player cannot identify with at all because he's essentially just a hollow shell.  Everything around you in a Half-Life game feels empty because you have no starting point to get an emotional investment.  ",5,0,1444336007,1444730760
