cvh9r8w,1,t3_3mp8ng,bigjim212,"Well, today, I had three exams today in school on physiology, medical genetics and biochemistry.  It was awesome learning all of it, but it took a lot out of me. 
It is the 5th week of the semester, and I am still loving what I do!  I hope that you all are doing well :)

cvejczg,0,t1_cvej942,bigjim212,"Fair enough, and I won't necessarily disagree.  I am thinking that there is going to be a pretty big break between the tea partiers and the standard issue republicans coming up-- there seems to be  rejection of the tea party that once handed them power-- remorse, even.  I suppose a sign would be how  many of the republican congressmen and women vote with Democrats for a moderate speaker. ",3,0,1443242214,1444723480

cv91vh1,0,t1_cv8xq2r,bigjim212,"Really? Execution in the USA is not inherently fast, and botched executions happen often, and often to innocent people. See here:  http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/30/us/oklahoma-botched-execution/ and http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/13/health/death-row-stories-execution-methods/ .    According to a study by Dr. Samuel Gross from the University of Michigan, around 4% of people are innocent on death row. Besides, when did we start using better than SA on human rights as a success? 

... Or The USA has a disproportionate imprisonment of racial minorities

Oh, and right!! The USA also has had a recent history of torturing people that are disproportionately one religion! Whooo! Yup, keep telling yourself that Murica is totally better than SA.

So bring on the down votes, but ya'll need to realize we have some serious problems with human rights in this country, and using the defense we aren't as bad as crucifixion, is just an excuse. ",1,0,1442847650,1444723480
