Just to be clear: I'm not just trying to play hotseat with AI, i am trying to play hotseat with mods. What you describe here sounds like the standard hotseat options. I do appreciate all the help your giving me, just wanted to clarify this part.",1,0,1443903674,1444731732
cvldd97,0,t1_cvkarei,DillonV,"no problem and thanks for trying. 

I still cant get it to work, but when i delete the cache, and unsubscribe and resubscribe via overlay i see it pop up in my mods list for a split second than disappear. I've tried to proceed anyways but couldn't find the custom advanced setup in the saved section.  ",1,0,1443759118,1444731732
cvjwe54,0,t1_cvjgp5b,DillonV,"Can you clarify what you mean by selecting the mods in the steam overlay? I would like to try this but i don't understand. I will try to verify the files tonight. I dont use workshop mods for any of my other games, so i cant say if it works elsewhere or not. Thanks for all your input. 

EDIT: unsubscribed & resubscribed, verified integrity. Still cant get the mod to work. 


Question: Do you just subscribe without having to unzip files in the mods folder?",1,0,1443655456,1444731732
