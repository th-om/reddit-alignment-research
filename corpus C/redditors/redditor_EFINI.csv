cv07eyd,1,t3_3ksor6,EFINI,"Remember that the Democratic Primary isn't decided by who gets the most votes, but rather who gets the most delegates, and a large amount of delegates (30% of the total required to win the nomination) are not awarded based on the results of the primary. These delegates (superdelegates) are Democratic senators, governors, congressman and party officials who are free to vote for they want - and chances are they will overwhelmingly vote for Clinton. Most of them are endorsing Clinton and not *one* has endorsed Sanders so far.

I think Sanders now has a chance of winning the popular vote in the primary, but his chances of winning by a large enough margin to negate Hillary's superdelegate count are less optimistic. ",6,0,1442166581,1444729362
