I'd rather not spend $4,000 fixing an old car when I could put it towards a car that will last me another decade. I guess it's also about piece of mind.

Of course that contrasts not having a car payment to work against paying down the CCs. Just torn.",2,0,1444681388,1444731934

Guns are dangerous and deserve a certain level of respect and regulation. We don't treat caustic chemicals or explosives this casually. Even cars are more heavily regulated than guns. It's grossly inconsistent.",80,0,1444674890,1444731934

cvwvo4z,1,t3_3obu65,CpnJackSparrow,"After having bladder stone surgery, I left the hospital with a penile catheter which stayed in for over a month. A couple of nights after finally getting it out, I awoke with an indescribable sensation. I got out of bed, took two steps and felt like I was uncontrollably peeing. I got to the bathroom and flipped on the light and my penis was spraying blood everywhere. Not knowing what else to do, I directed the stream into the toilet. After 10 seconds of barely-awake shock, I started applying pressure at different places along the shaft to try to stem the tide, like one tries to stop a nose bleed. Eventually it subsided. 

When I called the doctor's office the next day, they said ""Oh, that may happen from time to time."" 

And you just forgot to mention that my dick would turn into a bloody geyser?",1,0,1444656538,1444731934
cvwshee,0,t1_cvwar7w,CpnJackSparrow,"Oh, you wanted a partisan perspective?

Four Americans are dead, and Republicans spend millions of taxpayer dollars, years of investigations, hundreds of thousands of documents, hundreds of hours of testimony and they still haven't found anything conclusive about the *Secretary of State.* They're not paying a moment's attention to the people that actually committed the act.

Meanwhile, eight Americans die in an Amtrak derailment and how do Republicans respond? By cutting Amtrak's budget HOURS later. Before the bodies were cold. No special select committees. No years-long investigations. 

Republicans have already admitted this entire Benghazi furor was never about justice for four dead Americans, but was about hurting Clinton politically. They're exploiting the deaths of four Americans for political downvotes. That's the despicable part of your diversionary accusation.
