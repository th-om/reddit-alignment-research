Really, it was a cogent though emphatic response, and you summing it up as ""ANNNNGGGRRRYYY!"" just seems childish and cowardly, like you're afraid to honestly address what's being said.

> As long as you don't cause problems for me I don't care... but the second you cause problems for me you are now the unjustified one

Seriously? Do you realize how sociopathic and narcissistic that sounds? That the world revolves around you and everyone should make sure they don't get in your way, because *you've got a gun* and the second they cause harm or *inconvenience*, they're ""the unjustified one."" Are we in the Wild West, where you feel the need to hold court in the street?

> You have no idea what you're talking about. You just genuinely don't have sufficient/correct information.

You could try supplying what you view as the correct information, to go against all the studies floating around this thread that show he's actually correct.

> You don't understand how gunfights or lethal force encounters work

So, he's had firsthand encounters de-escalating situations involving both knives and guns. Part of his uniform is, apparently, stab-proof. What is your experience with amateur gunfights and lethal encounters?",1,0,1444688885,1444717436

Laws are deterrents, that's a fact, and just because it's not a sufficient deterrent to stop *all*, does not mean that it's not stopping *some*.

But even ignoring that, what law *isn't* violated? Should we get rid of all those laws being broken and call them failed experiments because some people still break them?",1,0,1444688246,1444717436
