""Assault weapons with large-capacity magazines can fire more shots, faster, and thus can be more dangerous in aggregate,"" said Judge Frank Easterbrook in April for a 2-1 majority. ""Why else are they the weapons of choice in mass shootings? A ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines might not prevent shootings...but it may reduce the carnage if a mass shooting occurs.""",10,0,1444578226,1444721970

I've been a gun owner since I was 10 when my father gave me my first 22, and I still have that rifle, 15 rnd capacity through the stock. For most of my life, firearms were only about recreation. I went target and clay shooting with my friends, but never really thought about self defense. That all changed when once we had children. I had the realization that I was responsible for their safety, and that I wasn't doing everything I could to protect them. This is when I bought my first pistol, took some classes, bought some holsters, and got my CC permit. My wife eventually did the same and we've been spreading the message to everyone we can ever since. ",2,0,1444282599,1444721970

""In the majority opinion authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Court first conducted a textual analysis of the operative clause, ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" The Court found that this language guarantees an individual right to possess and carry weapons. The Court examined historical evidence that it found consistent with its textual analysis. The Court then considered the Second Amendment’s prefatory clause, ""[a] well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,"" and determined that while this clause announces a purpose for recognizing an individual right to keep and bear arms, it does not limit the operative clause.""",1,0,1444229693,1444721970

The phrase ""well-regulated"" was in common use long before 1789, and remained so for a century thereafter. It referred to the property of something being in proper working order. Something that was well-regulated was calibrated correctly, functioning as expected. Establishing government oversight of the people's arms was not only not the intent in using the phrase in the 2nd amendment, it was precisely to render the government powerless to do so that the founders wrote it.",2,0,1444186571,1444721970
