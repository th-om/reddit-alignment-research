cvxjjh7,1,t3_3ogwci,doormatt26,"So my dream tier: Chip Kelly, Kyle Whittingham, Jack Del Rio, and anyone of the establish top 10 CFB coaches (Meyer, Saban, D'antonio, etc). 

My ""more likely"" tier: Tom Herman (Houston), Justin Fuente (Memphis), Bryan Harsin (Boise State). Would be interested what other mid-major up and comers people think would be good. 

My ""avoid"" list: Jeff Fisher, anyone who works/has worked with Pete Carroll. 

I don't know a lot about the OCs and DCs from the NFL beyond how their units are doing this season, but good options there. 

I think beyond everything I want someone a little hard-nosed and no-nonsense. We've got talent for days we need discipline and a good mind for Xs and Os, I don't care as much for charisma atm. My actual top choices that seem plausible would probably be Kelly, Whittingham, and Harsin, in that order. ",2,0,1444693991,1444723850
cvxj7w3,0,t1_cvx7mkg,doormatt26,"Definitely agree. Del Rio I'd like, Fisher is a little uninspired, he's been consistently mediocre as an NFL HC. Doubt either would leave anyway as well. Chip would be really cool, also doubt he leaves but he's had struggles which make it seem moderately more plausible. ",1,0,1444693478,1444723850
