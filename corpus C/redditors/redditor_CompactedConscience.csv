None of the views that be expresses in this article have changed, and none of the views that caused him to disavow republicans have changed. More importantly, his views on the bailout and debt haven't changed.",2,0,1444695432,1444716506
cvxi0f8,0,t1_cvx83kw,CompactedConscience,"They don't have on officially, but they are also people who are free to register with or identify with a party if they want to. Bernanke always considered himself a republican, until recently. ",2,0,1444691502,1444716506
cvxhuss,0,t1_cvwzsox,CompactedConscience,"Bernanke hasn't shifted on policy. He believes the exact same things as he did when he left office. He just thinks the republicans have shifted. None of the issues he identifies disagreeing with his former party on are issues you listed. 

Nothing you typed is a cogent criticism of Bernanke. Bernanke plaid no role in the current US debt. He helped implement a bailout regime that was passed by congress, and is believed by the overwhelming majority of economist to have prevented a depression. He left office after a reasonably long tenure. ",1,0,1444691244,1444716506
cvx4gpi,0,t1_cvx2zcp,CompactedConscience,"Empirical is not the same thing as predictive. Conflating the two things makes it sound like you don't really funders the kind of work being done in economics. I would say that 99.9% of economist don't do work that is relevant to forecasting when crises will happen. That isn't their research area. It is like faulting physics for not being able to predict hurricanes with accuracy. Weather forecast is only one application of certain findings in physics, and is simply not relevant to what most physicist do. I don't understand why so many people who do not have a clear grasp of what economics involves insist on having strong opinions about it.

My second argument was actually no types of fallacy. ",5,0,1444671508,1444716506
cvx2dky,0,t1_cvx26iz,CompactedConscience,I know its... not true. Economics is largely an empirical field and the stuffy academics who conduct it have neither the motivation nor the ability to do anything you just said.,4,0,1444668392,1444716506
cvx20cc,0,t1_cvx1r2s,CompactedConscience,"I just don't feel like that is the case because your argument was pretty thoroughly refuted.

The economics prize is called a Nobel Prize by the Nobel Committee. They are the people who choose what is and is not a Nobel Prize. ",5,0,1444667821,1444716506
cvwzstw,0,t1_cvwwaom,CompactedConscience,"Hey! Your source doesn't say the economics prize isn't a Nobel Prize. It only says it wasn't one of the original prizes. Your source does not support the point you are making. 

Ultimately, the Nobel committee determines what is and is not a Nobel Prize. The wishes of a long dead guy are not relevant or important. It is clear that the committee believes the economics prize is a Nobel. 

You have accused other people of only supporting calling the economics prize a Nobel because they want to enhance the prestige of economics. Could it be that you don't want it to be a Nobel because you want to detract from the prestige of economics? Could it, in fact, be that you are the person making a transparent political point?",3,0,1444664309,1444716506
cvwmsdo,0,t1_cvwm9xs,CompactedConscience,"By tepid, I don't mean that she has changed her mind. I just mean that I don't think she feels very strongly about it. I bet her thoughts on health care and abortion rights are pretty closely held. I would imagine she has strong feelings about some specific foreign policy ideas. 

I think all of those issues are also issues where she has not flip flopped on any major points. Issues where I am not as sure how strongly she feels, but where I don't think she has significantly flip flopped include immigration reform, college debt, her response to climate change, gun control, tax code changes, the appropriate size of the social safety net, and probably about a thousand other issues.

cvwb55c,0,t1_cvw9uc3,CompactedConscience,"This is exactly where I am. She is still far more closely aligned to me on almost every issue than any of the other candidates. And I feel like her opposition to it was kind of tepid, anyway.",8,0,1444603745,1444716506
cvw61ok,0,t1_cvw4uqy,CompactedConscience,"I think there are differences that make less turnover at that position less democratic, or at least seemingly less democratic. There is only one president. With Congress, there are always some new people coming in from some districts or states. The president also wields so much power that it would be especially dangerous if long tenures tend to corrupt. Incumbency and name recognition might also be more potent advantages for the executive then for Congress. Finally, I think the skills required to draft legislation are more technical and harder to get in other jobs than the skills needed to be president. So experience ""on the job"" might simply be more helpful for Congress.


All of these points are certainly debateable.",6,0,1444595412,1444716506
