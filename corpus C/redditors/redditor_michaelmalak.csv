cvwrp9g,0,t1_cvwohps,michaelmalak,"Supervised vs unsupervised puts it into the camp of machine learning, not AGI, as it implies single shot execution over a fixed set of data to create a model (usually static at that).

In a sense, all AGI will be supervised because it will optimize its pleasure and minimize its pain, however pleasure and pain are encoded into its ""DNA"".

In the case of DeepMind playing Atari, the pain is pre-hard-wired to the score. A true AGI would have had to learn the social cues, such as verbal cues or a soothing virtual stroke on the head, and learned to read the score on its own. Really, playing Atari with the score decoded for it is such pathetic progress after 60 years of researching perceptrons that I hesitated to include it. But the potential is unknown if they could make the leap to embody it into a robot body.",3,0,1444642748,1444716668
