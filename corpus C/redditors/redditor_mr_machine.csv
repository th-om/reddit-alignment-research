cvre3ga,1,t3_3nulx0,mr_machine,"Most beginners start with cheapo soldering irons that are harder to work with than they need to be. I know I did. If you solder with any regularity, it's *totally worth it* to invest about $100 in a good temperature-controlled soldering station -- a Hakko or a Weller, say. It's a totally different experience. I literally solder for fun.

As far as ""re-designing"" the soldering iron goes, I respectfully snicker. There are incredibly many variations on the soldering iron on the market already, covering every conceivable use case. It would be awesome if you came up with something mind-meltingly better, of course, but it seems... unlikely? Best of luck.",6,0,1444234056,1444725507
