cvvtfbx,0,t1_cvvsoim,metatron207,"I don't know how you'd get a representative sample short of registering every citizen 18+, reinstating felons where necessary, and then pulling such a sample from all registered voters and requiring them to vote. But if you're going that far, you might as well select a random sample to serve in Congress.

As for having voters who are better educated, let me clarify. ""Education"" is a loaded term, but what I mean is making sure that voters have a basic understanding of how the system works, or at least how it's *supposed* to work. I taught civics to different populations for a number of years, and the level of understanding that people of high school age and up have about civics and government is downright frightening. Put simply, if citizenship weren't a birthright but something you had to apply for when you turn 18, and you had to go through the same process as those being naturalized, I don't think we'd have very many citizens/voters at all.",1,0,1444574228,1444724952
cvvhqdj,0,t1_cvvdm31,metatron207,"A friend of mine from high school bought a tent and set it up in her yard to air out before using it. Her dog ran through and made a couple of good gashes in it. She took it back, hoping she could pay for a decent repair, and they basically demanded (nicely) that she take a new one. She was shocked, since it was entirely her dog's fault, but they said she'd paid for a new tent, and she should have one. 

Having said that, the recent death of Leon Gorman, the oldest member of the family and the head of the company, has led to a lot of speculation that this policy is reaching its end. We may not have LL Bean's wonderful return policy much longer.",4,0,1444535697,1444724952
cvvh5qr,0,t1_cvvgf0n,metatron207,"I agree with you in principle, but I also think that it would be relatively easy to make Election Day a holiday unlike the rest. In the law that established it, you could mandate the closure of all workplaces *except* public transportation, public safety, and of course poll-related jobs.

Still not sure that an election holiday is a good idea, or that 100% turnout is inherently good. Having better-educated voters might be more important than having more voters. Certainly, though, one of the fundamental keys to our democracy is ensuring that everyone has *access* to the polls, and an election holiday is one way of trying to provide a guarantee of access.",4,0,1444534617,1444724952
