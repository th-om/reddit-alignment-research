Strangely, I suspect that **were virtually any other group disadvantaged as a result of the disparity**, the response, ""Well, $GROUP are probably just predisposed against $ACTIVITY"" would not be a sufficient answer.  But for social scientists it is!  Wheee!

Also, I'm pretty sure overt discrimination accounts for at least *some* of the wide disparity between conservatives and liberals in academia ([source](https://journals.cambridge.org/images/fileUpload/documents/Duarte-Haidt_BBS-D-14-00108_preprint.pdf#page=32), [source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rabble-rouser/201310/liberal-bias-in-social-psychology-personal-experience-ii), [source](http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0735-7028.17.5.473), [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=KgrKSAAACAAJ&hl=en), [source](http://yoelinbar.net/papers/political_diversity.pdf)).

>>If over half of psychology studies from a selective sample of pretty significant ones failed to reproduce the same data, what does that tell me about the rest of the studies on which policy is based?

>Not much, actually? The whole point of studying bias is that you shouldn't, and likely will, make precipitous conclusions on the basis of suggestive data. That's like literally what publication bias is. 

Interesting, because those ""studying"" bias are quick to recommend government polices to remedy things like apparent wage gaps, or racial disparities in graduation, or income inequality -- but I guess disparities in their own fields are off limits, conveniently.

What am I supposed to do, just assume that every study that wasn't in the linked studies are examples of perfect science?  That the Reproducibility study *just happened* to nab the guilty offenders and everyone else's house is clean?",0,0,1444691453,1444716382

**Free College:**  The government has been throwing money at college for decades ([source](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/spending_chart_2004_2020USr_16s1li111lcn_24t)), and the result has been costs exploding at faster than the rate of inflation.  This is entirely expected, since by artificially increasing the amount of money in the education consumer's (in this case, prospective college students) hands, you have artificially increased the demand for education services, and there has not been a commensurate increase in the **supply** of education services.  Colleges deal with this in many ways:  By lowering admissions standards, lowering graduation standards and inflating student grade achievement WITHOUT a corresponding increase in academic quality ([source](http://www.econ.unt.edu/~mcpherson/Papers/AE.2013.pdf), [source](http://www.gradeinflation.com/), [source](https://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/decline1.htm)), and by raising prices ([source](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/InflationTuitionMedicalGeneral1978to2008.png)).  

Making it ""free"" by flicking a pen and voting on it changes **exactly nothing** as to how education consumers are serviced by education producers -- it is tantamount to wishing the problem away.  Of course it won't go away, education consumers will only demand MORE education from an already strained supply of education, and education producers will worsen in quality as the funding becomes stretched increasingly thin.  People who might've otherwise become Ivy League professors will see opportunities for greater returns elsewhere, and the U.S. education system will lose out on their experience and knowledge.

**Higher Taxes on the Rich:**  There is historical precedent for this one, but nothing so far as effectiveness.  Supporters of higher taxes on the wealthy often cite ""high effective rates"" in the 1950's and 1960's, but those were never seriously enforced -- we can see that Federal, State, and Local tax revenue has increased over time -- inflation adjusted ([source](http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/revenue_chart_1950_2020USk_17s1li011lcn_F1lF1sF1f)), and even as a percentage of GDP ([source](http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/revenue_chart_1950_2020USp_17s1li011lcn_F1lF1sF1f)).  Moreover, the tax code has been shifting towards an increasing tax burden on the wealthiest since *at least* the late 1970's, if not earlier ([source](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/Tax_liability_Shares_1.pdf)).  The wealthiest have already been paying the bulk of **all** Federal taxes.

The only reason they're doing better than ever, is because government policy (*especially* in the wake of the recession) such as the Fed's quantitative easing and 0% interest rates are much more beneficial to, say, wealthy individuals who make their money from capital gains ([source](http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/crs-1.pdf)), than to poor people who make their money by toiling for hours on end.  Of course, the Left's solution to this isn't to return to sound money or eliminate the economic shamanism at the Federal Reserve, but to tax capital gains more aggressively and distribute the income amongst ~~voters who will reward them in the elections~~ everyone equally, surely.

**Long Story Short?**  Bernie Sanders isn't the first politician to propose that the government give everyone everything they need, and he won't be the last.  But, put simply, in a world driven by scarcity and economic incentives, that political position is *doomed to fail.*  When it does, you won't just be taking yourselves down, you'll be taking everyone along with you -- including the people who insisted this would happen in the first place.

The Left should stick to protesting wars, and (groan) exposing us all to the plight of those less fortunate than we are -- we badly need you there.  But left-wing economics, in my opinion, is wishful, emotionally-driven nonsense and Bernie Sanders is the worst example of that in a long, *looooooong* time.",0,0,1444689819,1444716382
