cvxvuzj,0,t1_cvxi1hg,boredymcbored,"The NBA is becoming my favorite league even though I like football more. They embrace players, allow them to show their personality, market themselves and take care of them after retirement. Because of this, the players look like they are having fun and therefore I have fun. NFL is so conservative and authoritarian, I'm losing interest.",3,0,1444716213,1444727860
cvxvpnh,0,t1_cvxqudv,boredymcbored,"Can confirm. I made sure to mark my calendar for warriors tv games just because Steph Curry had vicious highlights all over my Twitter and instagram. Before I wanted to watch their games but didn't have time. After I saw highlights on my social media, I MADE time.",1,0,1444715776,1444727860
cvxvh04,0,t1_cvxulvv,boredymcbored,"I agree but I really want to see Geno play just so we can finally decide if he's a serviceable QB or not.  I'm honestly really excited for his upside but the only way to swap the QBs at this point is negative (Fitz losing or getting injured). Still, since we're winning, I'm not really complaining.",1,0,1444715069,1444727860

cvxue1o,0,t1_cvxu34t,boredymcbored,"As long as the player has the uniform on, no, I don't care what the players wear. Honestly, the only reason the NFL is against players personalizing their accessories is because they don't want their players to stand out and increase their marketability. It's pure greed by the NFL's part. They want to rake in cash and don't care for the players to do the same. ",3,0,1444712187,1444727860
cvxtvxk,1,t3_3oixgs,boredymcbored,"Again, I feel like this accents a huge problem that shouldn't even really be a problem, in the NFL. Why is it that players can't wear whatever accessories they want? It happens in literally all the other major sports, however the NFL has a problem with it. It emphasizes the lack of care the NFL has for it's players and how greedy they are. Fine your players for petty things and limiy their individual marketability.",2,0,1444711056,1444727860
cvxto8w,0,t1_cvxspxq,boredymcbored,"Really? Like really? How is wearing different colored accessories chaotic? In literally all the other sports leagues, players are allowed to wear whatever accessories they want. How is the NFL justified in being the only league that doesn't? They aren't. The nfl is just full of money hungry assholes.",7,0,1444710597,1444727860
