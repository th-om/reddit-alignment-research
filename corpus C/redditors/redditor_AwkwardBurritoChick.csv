cvxlzt8,1,t3_3of8mo,AwkwardBurritoChick,"I have to laugh - I made a batch last week and froze the left overs.  I do this method too of using the cooker for the onions. 

Additions I have to my recipe is using 3 lbs of different onions - vidalia, white, shallots and leeks and I throw in some garlic cloves since we like garlic in nearly everything.  I also add in a 1/2 cup of dry sherry, and throw in a cheese cloth of thyme sprigs, whole black pepper corns, a bay leaf.   

French Onion Soup is definitely one of my favorite slow cooker meals!! Thanks for posting!

cvvg6vj,1,t3_3oad39,AwkwardBurritoChick,"Watched this again ""Freedom of the Press"" is what we have.  Again, because when our country was under control of the King, there was no freedom of speech or critique.   The Freedom of Speech was intended to be able to express dissent...so shame on Carson and shows he's just a freshman in high school trying to get a JD law degree or Masters degree.  It doesn't say ""Freedom of the press to be objective"".   

He's also a piss poor speaker.  He doesn't motivate me, he makes me want to upload his speeches to my phone so I can use it a white noise to sleep better.

cvvg4lw,1,t3_3oad39,AwkwardBurritoChick,"And you know what - this dude, doctor, candidate has said so many offensive things in the past three weeks.. he seriously thinks after making such highly offensive, uninformed statements, deemed highly offensive to many (including me) that he thinks he has a stance to demand some sort of censorship on the first amendment?!  Frig him.  He dishes out stupid/offensive comment/lies and yet he expects objectivity? 

Screw him.  He doesn't deserve to represent anyone from any party in any region - hence why he's probably never held any political office before.  He simply fails to understand how any of this works.

cvvg0o6,1,t3_3oad39,AwkwardBurritoChick,"I also realized, he's a Doctor, so they have medical reviews and such.. which is based on findings, objective information.  Yet he's now in politics and for the most desired and predominant positions in this country which is ALL about various opinions and not objective. 

You can't be objective when you're trying to unite and do what is best of a country that has a great economic, political and social divide.  

With that, this comment he made, totally made me realize where I could consider him, I simply can't.   He can't get that he came from an objective scientific world into that of politics and tremendous criticism and exposure, he needs to reconsider what it is he's trying to accomplish or go forward.

With that, he has to realize, if he's crying ""Boo hoo"" butt hurt this early, he needs to realize how much more it will be if he is the General election candidate and the real guns and opinions come out and IF he is President, how it will get even more intense. 

If he can't handle harsh judgment now, I have a box of maxi pads he can tape to his cheeks to capture his tears of butt hurt.

cvvfssx,1,t3_3oad39,AwkwardBurritoChick,"I don't think that Carson understands the ""Freedom of the Press"" and how that objectivity or non-partisan is an issue or law... People can write into newspapers (old school) their letters to the editor with their opinion, and that people can blog on the internet, and if he's upset with the GQ commentary... he's in for a long ride that the freedom of press truly means.  

Freedom of press doesn't state objectivity - if so Fox News would have died a long time ago, considering how many reports state that those that get their information from Fox News are LESS informed than others that get information second hand.

BTW this shows how immature, how green, he is not ready to handle any level of being a President as any President is always going to be exposed to a level of opinion and criticism. 

YES... true journalism is about being objective, but the freedom of press, is intended to be able to share opinions, statements, if we look back into history, that when our nation was created, fought for and ratified, that our Founding Fathers were able to critique, have a voice, in a then world of taxation with no representation that helped us come to the point we had decided to have our Revolutionary War and separate from England/UK and King George III.   

Carson and his team seems to be too butt hurt, lacking a thick skin to realize when you put forth yourself in such a manner, with the internet and social media, that when you say something in any forum it's going to spread, and if outrageously so, going to go viral and spread viraly. 

Carson is basically trying to re-define what ""freedom of press"" is by stating the 'press' has to be objective - eh, no.  Nope. Nuh-uh.  Not true for several decades...not going to happen now.  We have the freedom, be it as journalists or just regular people, to share our opinions.   

First Amendment also causes with the blanket of protection (even when offensive) that the burning of our Flag to be protected under the First Amendment Freedom of Speech - because even if it is offensive, it opens a door as to the SUpreme Court and GOvernment as to if we do not allow us citizens to express or share our opinions and Federal laws made to censor - when or how is it decided what those lines are?

With Carson, if he can't understand that if news media is 'enforced' to be objective, then it will then impede on the ability for citizens to speak freely via blogs, internet comments, phone calls, etc. 

Carson apparently has a thin skin and not able to take the fact that he's put himself into a national spot light, will be reported objectively and subjectively... and that's just how it is.  He cannot control the freedom of expression of what others think about him..

And if anything, the past two weeks, this man who originally I felt some underdog support for, has lost it completely.  The past two weeks of insane comments based on being insensitive, non-nonsensical, and now this? Willing to censor free speech? 

Nope.  Nope. Nope.  The more he's put in the spotlight the more he seems to be losing me.  I thought he was the anti-trump agression but now with this, I can't consider anyone who would make it wrong for me to even type this post out because it offends him and not objective. 

Freedom of Speech is all about the freedom to dissent openly and without punishment - as intended by James Madison when he drafted the Bill of Rights.   If Carson misses that point.. well, yea.. shows maybe we need someone on the GOP side that gets that aspect - and without holding a bible. ",1,0,1444531957,1444723339
cvvex5l,0,t1_cvvemdw,AwkwardBurritoChick,"Also, what GOP candidate will ""Crush"" Sanders if it comes down to the General Election and based on what Poll? I'm open to links as I know in the past few months there has been a large variable as to ratio of electable variances - but changing constantly.  And most likely to keep changing until the final electorates decided in April.

cvvetl9,0,t1_cvvemdw,AwkwardBurritoChick,"True.. but it IS possible, and again, this is the Wild Card theory I brought up.. that it's possible, contingent of the timing of the vacancies of the SCOTUS positions what ultimately is in the Senate.  

Example. Supreme Court Justice passes away or retires/resigns, after in 2016 we have a GOP President (and please feel free to share who you think that would be) that in 2017, or even in 2016, the Senate majority turns Democrat. ANd that is the trend.. it was a short window that Obama had when first elected had the House and Senate in Congress all Democrat.. and then sure enough, and likely enough, through mid term elections that Congress will flip. 

There are no guarantees at this point... none.  We right now can go  with this Presidential Race either way, but it history will show, the November after will most likely change the Senate seats and majority. 

President can nominate; Senate approves... we just have to wait this out.

cvvegx7,0,t1_cvvdgfg,AwkwardBurritoChick,"Also I think you missed the basic aspect that a President can nominate a Supreme Court Justice, but it's up to the Senate to confirm and approve the nomination.  So we don't know if the next elected President, if a Republican President will have to nominate while still having a GOP majority in the Senate or if we have a Democrat President and a Senate still GOP majority... or even if it happens tomorrow... We simply do not know how the next 1-3 likely vacancies in the Supreme Court is going to go as we don't know the literal politics and parties behind it.  

As far as I've seen in my years, it's rare and a short window of time that the House, Senate and President are of the same party..and even in the short windows, any sort of nomination approval process isn't a smooth or guaranteed ride.

cvvdx7e,0,t1_cvvdgfg,AwkwardBurritoChick,"I apologize if I didn't make it clear ""IF Sanders wins the Presidential Election"".  I'm not saying he can or will, just IF.  

At this point, there really isn't any clear candidate that can win or will win.  It's pretty much, in my opinion, a wild card on both sides as who to will be the final candidates in the General and from there how the election will turn out.  On the Democratic side, especially Hillary has been felt to be the given choice, but Sanders has been steadily growing in support and even though he doesn't get much media attention, getting the most (I think?) grass roots support, and has a solid record going for 40 years.  The Democrats also have a very small pool to choose from and it seems it will boil down to Hillary or Sanders come final selection from the DNC, but it's fair to say it will most likely be one of them as Biden, now 2-3 days befor the debate hasn't entered into the race.  

Again, seems cards still are Wild 13 months out. 

Unless there is something I'm missing about one of the parties on either sides being a clear contender... I'd be more than happy to hear the supportive argument as to who that would be.  I'd even settle to hear who you feel would be the two General Election candidates and who you foresee winning of those two and the reasons why. 

The one reason I'm following so closely is because I've never seen such a Presidential campaign race like this ever before, with such a vast number of those running, all with their pros and cons (well, I'm excluding those in the GOP currently with 6% polling or less)... and no one to me is standing out as a true and clear easy choice.  

Especially since there is such a divide on so many stances and issues, and even within parties.  GOP especially where you have these non-politicians now polling strong and on the Democratic side Hillary vs Sanders has their own set points as to how they differ even if on the same platform and stances on issues. 

I'm not ruling out Sanders at this point.  It's gonna be easier and more real come April with the final Nominees are selected. 

The other aspect is that many Sanders supporters just want the Presidential position to remain Democratic and if Bernie drops out or is not the General Election candidate, that who ever is selected, will get Bernie's votes.   

With that, it's fair to say that if Sanders drops out or doesn't get the GE nomination as the final candidate, that most will support whomever that person will be, be it Biden or Hillary. 

I'll take it a bit further... my SO is a conservative and he's willing to support Biden if he enters, makes it to the GE as the final candidate only because he, as a conservative, feels the GOP has gotten too extreme and he can't see himself supporting ANY of the current GOP candidates.
