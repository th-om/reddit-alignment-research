cvtv7s8,0,t1_cvtqezw,Waylander0719,"Actually, due to inflation debt will go down as long as we borrow less then spending + inflation.

For example say we bring in $100 and spend $110. We borrow $10. But as long as year to year inflation is higher then the interest we owe on the 10 dollars the amount we owe as a % of GDP will decrease.

$10 debt = 10% of GDP
Next year same amount of GDP but 5% inflation means GDP is now $105 while the interest on a treasury bond is ~2%.

That $10 we borrowed is now worth 10.2 dollars or 9.7% of GDP (because debt does not increase with inflation only with interest).

As this trend continues eventually that money we borrowed will be worth less and less and be less and less of a problem for us to pay off.",4,0,1444409673,1444722597

They do a fantastic job of breaking down plays and telling you the hows and whys of what goes on. It really gave me a deeper appreciate of the game once I more started to understand the amount of mental chess that goes on pre snap.",3,0,1444330009,1444722597
