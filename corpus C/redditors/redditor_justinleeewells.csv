Additionally, how is disabling crit animations not on this list? Haha.",3,0,1444673802,1444724166

cvx3smq,1,t3_3oh08n,justinleeewells,"1. I generally have over a thousand unknown scrolls at any point in time. They would never allow you to combine 100 for 1.

2. I doubt they would do this solely because it would feel like your mana disappears too quickly.

3. The chances of summoning a 3* from 10 unknown scrolls is significantly lower than that. There's absolutely no way they would ever do this. Same kinda goes for 4*. 

4. This would be cool. I like this one. It would probably be more expensive if they implemented it, though.",6,0,1444670528,1444724166

Generally people don't try making a speed team until they can 100% it, which it doesn't seem like you can do. I'd build Sig though. He should help.",1,0,1444549993,1444724166
