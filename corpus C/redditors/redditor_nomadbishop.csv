It tells the story of one man's quest for absolution, while neglecting the forty other servicemen who fought and bled and died for that chance in the same shit on the same day.",5,0,1444695393,1444722601

The guy was a stain on the reputation of the army that he swore an oath to. Fuck him and fuck anybody who is either dumb enough or spiteful enough to call him a hero.",23,0,1444694784,1444722601

When I'm at my best, the idea pops up once every few months, but when I'm at my worst, it's a battle I have to fight more than once per night and more than thrice per day.",2,0,1444691434,1444722601

Maybe it will help to distract us from all the racist sociopaths who think that they can earn their fame by racking up large body counts.",28,0,1444691255,1444722601

cvv50ug,1,t3_3o93bl,nomadbishop,"In ""The Suffering"" and its sequel, various elements of combat changed based on which view you were using.

The third-person camera allowed you to use melee weapon combos and gave you a better view of your immediate surroundings, while the first-person view increased the accuracy of your weapons, especially while moving.

This allowed you to switch between brawler and FPS playstyles on the fly. The mechanic was used to great effect to provide variety to the encounters, without making either one the objectively better choice.",46,0,1444511630,1444722601
