As far as what Dr. Carson was trying to achieve with the comment, he was just trying to make his personal beliefs known to the public. Same as every other candidate.",1,0,1444577937,1444731942

In all honesty I still just don't understand how banning them will ""combat hate and ignorance"". Its just not looking at it. Its not like its their goal to grow at all, its just a community that likes making fun of black people. Do you think less people hate fat people now that fph is banned?",1,0,1438296815,1444731942

Looking at the stats, relative to the reddit community its grown more in the past day than it has in the past 90 days (which would encompass the spike). I really don't think it being mentioned by the mods or whatever has affected it as much as you are making it seem.",1,0,1438285516,1444731942
