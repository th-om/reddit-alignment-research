I never used those words.  That is not rational debate.

What I said- that psychiatry uses the phrase ""mental disorder"" to mean brain defects/damage -is not an assumption.  It's what they say regularly.  And you can tell they mean the person is insane/subhuman because they believe they should have violent control of these people.

Your personal goals aren't very relevant: a giant industry is using ""disorder"" to dehumanize & when you use their language you promote their dehumanization of the innocent.

That's not the point.  ""Mental disorder"" isn't being used to say you're simply odd.  It's being used to imply someone is essentially insane due to brain damage/defects that cause their bad behaviors/feelings.  ie, to dehumanize them as a subhuman, who thus needs psychiatric violence/control of their lives.

> because it leads to unintentional dissonance in relationships

That's not being remotely fair.

- Under such reasoning *anything* that was deemed unusual/bad by the more common people could be called a ""mental disorder.""

- That *accusation* is no excuse to dehumanize people with either the ""disorder""/""disease"" words.

1. No evidence/conviction of any crime.

2. And it's subjective opinion:

Then I put it in a food processor to chop it up small, although that's optional.

Instead, ripping it apart with your hands works fine, or cutting it up.

Then you make a sauce.  I have a giant pan & cook about 6 blocks of tofu at once.  (Which costs about $2.50).  And this means I need to make a really good amount of sauce.

The sauce is usually a tad of oil, & bunch of spices & vegetables in a pan.  (eg a tomato.) Often lemon juice helps.

I don't know why you don't use tofu.  It is very low in carbs & IMO tastes way better than cauliflower.

It really is important to freeze the tofu to get all the water out.  If you don't have an expensive Asian style stove (that adds oxygen to get absurd temps), freezing it is the key.

- I didn't say that.  

- That dispute is not a rational reason to bring up Stalin.

- No one person made up the words ""socialism"" & *also* ""communism.""  It's historically accurate to view them as different things.  

It's fair to consider socialism a more vague goal (non-exploited workers, & thus workers owning their means of production) & normal/Marxist ""communism"" to be the beliefs of Marx.

But Marx did not invent the word communism, & thus someone could be speaking of ""communism"" *pre-*Marx, or even making up their own more modern philosophy.

If you call someone a Stalinist every time they you disagree, the problem is you.  

> To use something is to destroy it

Wrong.  eg I can carefully keep many of my metal tools in perfect condition.  Not 100% of them.  And that will become more common as products are made better someday, instead made to break in the modern world.

Someday almost everything around us will be made to last, not to break.

I'm not a Stalinist.  

*Suddenly this conversation has gone completely non-serious.*

> What is the difference?

Most people would use ""consume"" to speak of destroying something (or making it so it's no longer usable to you) on use.

That's not the same as ""personally used property.""  If you mean ""consume"" to mean ""personally used"" then we might not have a disagreement.

> Compared to what? 

Socialist/anarchist/communist property is the same- it's personally used property not used to exploit others.

Capitalist property, the vast majority of the time, is absentee ownership of land and/or it's natural resources to exploit workers.
