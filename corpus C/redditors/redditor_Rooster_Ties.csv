cvxeoey,0,t1_cvwvgl5,Rooster_Ties,"> It should never be up to the customer in how much a server gets paid. That should be the job of the employer. To me, a tip should be given if the service is good. It's something that shouldn't be expected.

You know, I'm all for paying wait-staff more base-pay -- but on top of that, I'm totally OK with the current tradition of tipping, with the expectation that the base-level of a tip should be around 15%.

The idea is that good wait-staff-persons will make more by delivering good service.  Being inattentive? -- and I'm likely to only tip 10%.  Have a good attitude, and remember to check back on us a couple times during our meal? -- I'm totally good for 15% or even a bit more.  Have a great attitude (but don't pour it on too thick), and remember that I asked for lime in my coke, AND remember to bring more lime in the refill too? -- oh yeah, you're definitely getting 20%, or even occasionally a little more than that.

The tradition of tipping isn't what's bad -- it's that tips are expected to replace some of what should be wages.  The way I look at it, tips should be on top of an at least OK wage to begin with.

cvwxxy7,0,t1_cvwbwyq,Rooster_Ties,"Same age, and I liked *The Wall* better in college, but my interest didn't last much more than about 5 years.  I think I've spun *The Wall* like maybe 10 times in the last 15 years (at most), and I'm right with you.

It's Roger's magnum opus, but I think it's a far better theatrical work, having more in common with various rock operas, and/or musical theatre. And in that context, I do think it definitely stands up. But on musical grounds alone, it just doesn't do it for me.

Still, Roger deserves all the credit in the world for his well-deserved successes with it over the years.  But **for me**, the last ""real"" Pink Floyd album is *Animals* -- though I do enjoy the heck out of Dave's post-Roger Floyd albums -- especially *The Endless River*, which I've already listened to more often (in total) than I ever have *The Wall* (cumulatively over the years).

I do like ""Comfortably Numb"", but better in theory than in practice. Which is to say that it's really great when I hear it, but I don't listen to it all that often.",1,0,1444661127,1444718092

cvu9qro,0,t1_cvu5x5i,Rooster_Ties,"My only assertion about *The Wall* effectively sounding like a Waters solo album was just that, based in the sound and style of the album, musically.

Obviously Ezrin and Gilmour both played a huge role too - and both deserve great credit for their efforts in those specific roles.  But I do think *The Wall* **sounds** more like everything Roger was involved with AFTER *The Wall*, than it does what came before.",-1,0,1444432562,1444718092

By definition, the middle-ground is the ground the exists between the two sides.  Each side gives a little, and that's the middle ground.

Your definition of what's legitimately politically possible is based on the false premise that a far right agenda is in any way possible to get through a fairly evening divided government.

But you can do whatever you want when you have a veto-proof majority in Congress, I'll grant you that (or else the Presidency, and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate).

Everyone has to compromise, both sides.  You don't just get to draw the baseline wherever you think you'd like to put it -- and call that reality.",11,0,1444427213,1444718092
