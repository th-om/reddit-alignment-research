But luckily for us, this [poll](http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/50df5d33-1c13-40bd-a318-1163d92dc29f.pdf) was already taken. And lucky for us, only 20 some-odd percent would vote for him, again.

cvtcu92,0,t1_cvtclx6,UnabatedMysteries,"Um. Even the police commissioner of Chicago names him as the reason for the violence. If you even read the first article, you can watch him say it for yourself. If the drugs weren't there, the violence wouldn't be surrounding it as it is. I mean you don't name someone public enemy number one for no reason whatsoever. You do realize that? I know you're really trying to push the agenda, but It's not really debatable. 

But since you're so adamant, let's see what your explanation is? The drugs? El chapos drugs? Gang violence? Over the drugs? The tooth fairy? Santa Claus? ",0,0,1444363143,1444716787

It's kind of suggested that it's already happening. And could be the cause of a lot of the increased craziness that we see. ",1,0,1444361110,1444716787

Because if you read anything on el chapo, or watch any documentary on him or do any research on the man, you'll realize he has been named ""Chicago's public enemy number 1"" a couple of times. Like he was [earlier this year.](http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/El-Chapo-Named-Chicagos-Public-Enemy-Number-One-Again-Following-Escape-314980501.html) 

Quite interesting. ",1,0,1444360355,1444716787
