cvm7a1p,1,t3_3n6737,oneeyedpenguin,"I think this thread is forgetting Dayne's greatest weakness, and really his only confirm (anti)feat... Getting killed by the little one while he fights the big one. As long as the fellowship stick to the strategy of the hobbits stabbing him in the back while he fights fellowship can't lose",1,0,1443824862,1444726108
cvl7vqm,0,t1_cvl6kvb,oneeyedpenguin,"I think you're seriously underselling the fellowship's feats. Gandalf solo'd a balrog. Throughout the story they are pretty much all (besides the hobbits) shown to have ridiculous durability and endurance, well beyond normal humans. Gimili and Legolas literally kill hundreds of uruki. Casually. and those are nothing to scoff at. I think Arthur is  hurt a lot by the fact that westoros is more realistic and thus the best knight there could not beat the best knight in  middle earth which is more mythic.

So the Pope has the ear of more religious Americans than anyone else could muster. I think that's something about 1/5-1/4 of all Americans.

cv5yd0g,0,t1_cv5jdd4,oneeyedpenguin,"The north shore is the proper term for a lot of suburbs (not all of them on the lake actually). The north coast could be describing just specially the towns on the lake and I wasn't sure if that was a thing. Not a big deal but it sounds kinda strange; it would be like calling the gold coast the gold shore.
