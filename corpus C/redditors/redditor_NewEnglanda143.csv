I once had a man come in off the street and ask to use the bathroom. I pointed the way to the men's room and as him using the facility was against the rules, I followed to insure he went into the right one.

He didn't. He went into the woman's room and was in the process of hiding himself in there when I went in and removed him. I called the cops after he left. He was found in another building doing the same thing.

Had that been a ""Gender Neutral"" bathroom, I would have had no reason to go in and check WTF he was doing.
