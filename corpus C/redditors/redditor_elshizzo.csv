I don't agree with that statement.   I just went and looked at it [here](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html)

The GOP frontrunner went in the following order...

Romney
Perry
Cain
Gingrich
Romney
Gingrich
Romney
Santorum
Romney

I mean we can debate it, but Santorum is pretty crazy in my book, and he was the last frontrunner before Romney was.

And it wasn't sequential.  Romney was the frontrunner on and off throughout.   Which could mean that the frontrunners today [Trump, Carson] could easily drop and come back like Romney did.

In my opinion, this election is also different from the last one in that this election the voters seem much more interested in electing an outsider candidate.   Which I think means candidates like Bernie, Trump, and Carson have better odds than they would previous years.",1,0,1444520885,1444725070

Hawking is an expert in his field no doubt, but we shouldn't act like his expertise translates to other fields.  

Ben Carson after all is an expert in being a brain surgeon, and we've seen from his presidential run how that doesn't seem to translate to his expertise in other matters, even other scientific ones.",106,0,1444503558,1444725070

The media automatically reports every one of these stories as ""Republicans say X, Democrats say Y"", and end the conversation there, automatically leaving the impression to the viewer that the truth is in the middle.

The GOP knows this.  The GOP is just playing the media to their advantage like they've done the entire past decade.",3,0,1444429986,1444725070
