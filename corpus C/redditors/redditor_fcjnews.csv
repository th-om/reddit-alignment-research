cv8nkfp,0,t1_cv833ze,fcjnews,"There are no homes on the block with the bums, it's the side of a parking lot. Unless you work at the Parking Authority center or go to the 7-Eleven everyday you could literally never have to walk on that block. It's a ridiculous reason to condemn living in a whole neighborhood let alone saying you wouldn't live in one of the most convenient parts of the entire city even if someone literally gave you $1000+ a month.

cv7xvi2,0,t1_cv7js6m,fcjnews,"Lol. Why? 

I think this area is pretty sweet. Reading market, chinatown, major train/subway/bus hub, franklin square, independence hall, medical centers, walking distance to old city, waterfront, etc. It's in the top 5 walkscore neighborhoods, way above Queen Village. There's one easily avoidable block with homeless, is that all? I've never lived in a city where I didn't pass homeless people walking to work. Your disgust for the area is strong, did you had some kind of traumatic experience here, like someone on a sidewalk asking you for change? ",2,0,1442763792,1444727593
cv7xd5c,1,t3_3ln5pc,fcjnews,"I've watched two episodes so far and still don't get the allure of this show. Was there a joke in here that I missed or is the randomness and shock factor *itself* the joke, kind of like Always Sunny In Philadelphia where offensive lines being delivered casually *is* the joke most often?",1,0,1442762802,1444727593

cv4nwte,0,t1_cv4nc7t,fcjnews,"Even if the politician in question is lying to take advantage of 9/11 for himself/his family, which Jeb is clearly doing?  I mean, could you imagine the CIA or TSA saying this line? ""We the CIA/TSA family kept America safe during the Bush era"". Yea, except the fucking part where you didn't! In fact it's usually a political *win* to reproach someone for unfairly trying to benefit off 9/11. ",2,0,1442498082,1444727593
cv4nofw,0,t1_cv4ne2f,fcjnews,"That it's an obviously flawed part of the original statement and the point of my question. Are we implying the proper way to judge how ""safe"" any past presidents kept is by ignoring the first 7 months and 3 weeks of their terms? That's absurdly arbitrary. ",4,0,1442497664,1444727593
