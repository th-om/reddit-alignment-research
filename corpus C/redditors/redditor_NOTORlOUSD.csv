cvwj1gl,0,t1_cvw0jsj,NOTORlOUSD,Many campuses hire students to drive full size busses (including UGA I believe).  It's usually in college towns with a smaller worker base.,9,0,1444618118,1444721244
cvwgrmd,0,t1_cvw310e,NOTORlOUSD,"I'm a civil engineer and used to live in Baton Rouge.  I agree that there are parts of the city that shouldn't have been repopulated after Katrina, like the Lower 9th Ward and St Bernard Parish.  The older parts of the city like the French Quarter and Garden District are actually well placed to avoid floods and had minimal direct damage from Katrina; they did have looting, rioting, and other indirect damage.  The majority of the middle class has moved to the North Shore (Mandeville, Covington, Slidell) and that area is much safer from a hurricane.

There are several economic reasons why New Orleans will never go away despite the risks.  The stretch of the Mississippi from New Orleans to Baton Rouge is the busiest port region in the US and the main link between the Mississippi Valley and international shipping routes.  It's the second largest region for oil refining and petrochemicals behind Houston.",12,0,1444614075,1444721244
cvw73oz,0,t1_cvw6yqc,NOTORlOUSD,"The fact that Klinsmann succeeded at the WC without Donovan *is* the point.  I'm not saying it was a good idea because I was absolutely against it, but he showed that he could rely on a bigger variety of players than Bradley did.",-2,0,1444597044,1444721244
cvw6vws,0,t1_cvw2jat,NOTORlOUSD,"Obviously, after looking at the stats that opinion is diluted.  I specifically meant major tournaments because Dempsey carried us in the Confed Cup and Donovan at the 2010 World Cup.  Obviously Dempsey was also the key scorer at the 2014 World Cup, so it swings both ways.  Klinsmann had very few games with Dempsey/Donovan/Altidore all three available compared to the last two years of Bradley.",1,0,1444596697,1444721244
cvw6leh,0,t1_cvw0kn0,NOTORlOUSD,"I agree that this should always be taken into account.  For example, Liverpool was vindicated in sacking Rodgers because they signed Klopp but Chelsea can't sack Mourinho because no one better is available.

Obviously few people would have said ""No"" to your question after we beat Netherlands and Germany back in May, but our recent run has made it a toss-up in my book.  Who are the realistic candidates for national team manager?",8,0,1444596243,1444721244
