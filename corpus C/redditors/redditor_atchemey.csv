If that means I have to say some harsh truths about my beloved Spartans, so be it. I'm not sticking my head in the sand and pretending that we are flawless. I'm going to try to understand what's going wrong and think about how to fix it.",2,0,1444667106,1444720912

I spent four years living and dying week to week. I've spent hundreds of hours studying film over the last few years, in addition to normal game watching. I've studied football strategy and theory, and I've spoken at length with some greatly experienced players. There are warning bells going off everywhere when you watch the team, and it would be dishonest of me to ignore them. Last year, everybody who wasn't watching us was down on us, but I had us significantly higher ranked than others because I saw the product on the field. Now, everybody who isn't watching us has us in the top 5-8 teams, but we have some serious flaws that I am concerned about.

Do I think we are a good team this year? Yes.  
Do I think we are a great team this year? Potentially.   
Do I think we are world-beaters this year? We have not demonstrated this yet.   
Lose the green glasses, evaluate honestly, and get off your high horse. Now is not the time for blind homerism.",5,0,1444655835,1444720912

cvwu0x1,0,t1_cvwckzi,atchemey,"I mean, I'm going to have Michigan ahead of us this week. I need to make my poll, but I'm 90% sure that's going to happen. They are convincing, we are not. I started the season mostly with ""who beat whom"" and record, because it was the only thing I had to go on. Now, style and control of games plays a bigger role, and, with only a 1 game difference in record, Michigan moves up and MSU moves down.",1,0,1444652094,1444720912

cvwtjnq,0,t1_cvwtgzk,atchemey,"I 100% disagree with you on every point you just made. (Except for the factual one about your time here.)

Baylor gets a ton of criticism, and rightly so. Their offense is assumed to be good, sure, but that's because they put up such stupid numbers. Even so, there is a ton of criticism or a really quite good defense. TCU arguably has as slightly worse offense and an underwhelming defense right now, but they get a pass on both sides. I don't see a lot of love for Baylor anywhere here.",6,0,1444650486,1444720912
