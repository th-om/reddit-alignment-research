cvu7tjm,0,t1_cvu7afz,guccibento,I prefer Hurns just cause I'm not certain Aiken is that talented or that he won't get bottled up by Haden.  Golden Tate is meh.,2,0,1444429106,1444722442
cvu7sbh,0,t1_cvu7oua,guccibento,"Cobb, Fitz, and Edelman.  Easy!  They're all more talented than James Jones.",1,0,1444429045,1444722442

cvu7o0f,0,t1_cvu7151,guccibento,"Yeah.  Crowell hasn't looked good compared to Duke, and Tevin Coleman is going to return to getting anywhere from 30-60% of snaps in Atlanta soon.",1,0,1444428838,1444722442

cvu5shf,0,t1_cvu0j1d,guccibento,"That's a really, really tough choice. My gut says V-Jax.  Washington is surprisingly disruptive to the passing game and lord knows Devonta and Julio will probably come out looking better than Hank.  Hurns is good but not on V-Jax's level.",1,0,1444425695,1444722442
cvu5po9,0,t1_cvu43y6,guccibento,"Hank, he's just a better athlete.",1,0,1444425568,1444722442
cvu5p9q,0,t1_cvu3mx6,guccibento,"Kamar Aiken is gonna be all alone against Haden and the rest of the Cleveland secondary.  Not a great situation.  Although NE's defense is tougher than we initially expected, at least there are other credible targets besides TWill--I'd go with him.",1,0,1444425550,1444722442
