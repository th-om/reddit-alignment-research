I finally gave up on their shitty console ports after I bought my BFG GeForce 6800GT OC and got a free copy of Splinter Cell 1. I spent somewhere on the order of 5 hours trying to escape the tutorial on that game because its triggers weren't working. Talk about a personal hell.

That occasion was the fourth or fifth and very last time Ubisoft fucked me in the ass. I literally haven't touched one of their games in over a decade. ",2,0,1444554278,1444723299

The practical next step is for people to start contacting these companies individually with a request for comment: tell them a few key points of the legislation about which they may not have been aware, ask for clarification of their views, and so on.

We also need a version of this list where anyone can contribute. Identify the issues to ask about (did you know that this treaty would cause X, Y, etc?) and press them relevantly and in context.",1,0,1444531069,1444723299

Most people (even doctors) don't seem to understand that saturated fat —like cholesterol — is a blanket term for a number of fatty acids that all have distinct effects on the body.

Dairy fats in particular have not been shown with much satisfaction to be a threat to human health. In fact, drinking whole fat milk has been associated with fewer cardiovascular risks than drinking skim.",1,0,1444354225,1444723299

Interesting.

SLI as we know it ([Scalable Link Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface)) wasn't released until 2004, but what you have here is actually [Scan Line Interleave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan-Line_Interleave), an earlier ribbon cable-based parallel AGP/PCI graphics implementation with the same acronym.",19,0,1444011038,1444723299
cvnqotq,0,t1_cvnppi3,latigidigital,"Yes, you're right on the designation -- I'm a little tired :)

I have heard with a fair degree of consensus that Germans at the time were accepting of (or at least willing to acquiesce) collateral damage with a sense of understanding that it was an unfortunate necessity. In my grandfather's case, he openly would say that the Germans were good people, taking care to note that their government was the problem -- so I don't believe he would have viewed favorably something like this.

I think the element of justification being missing from this effort in the Middle East right now is pretty key to the way we feel when these things happen. It's not as though you can very often think, ""that's absolutely horrible, but at least we kept the other 145,000 people in that town safe"", because we're just playing a game of ideological whack-a-mole in a region where we aren't very welcomed by the local population in the first place.

I would assume that anyone assigned this task would be hardened in some capacity, but I think that still has its limits with most people. This incident, and many like it recently, go well beyond collateral damage (e.g., risking a minimal number of innocents to ultimately reduce overall combat deaths) and instead venture off into a type of reckless negligence that is unfit for any purpose.",1,0,1443966227,1444723299

The people who called down the target ought to have some serious explaining to do, though.
