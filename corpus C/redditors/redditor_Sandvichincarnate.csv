When you think about the visceral reactions some people can have when seeing scenes that relate to past traumas I don't think it's unreasonable for content providers to offer trigger warnings. For people with PTSD, or other victims of trauma like rape victims, trigger warnings can help these people decide whether or not to watch said program, and avoid a mental breakdown. When to draw the line on what should deserve a trigger warning is a murky issue though.",1,0,1444595958,1444717177
