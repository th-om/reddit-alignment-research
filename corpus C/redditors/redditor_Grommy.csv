cvxv2ii,0,t1_cvxu0ch,Grommy,I had a moment similar to this a few months ago while flying over the Pacific. Just the realization that I was sitting in a metal tube moving 500+ mph over the biggest body of water on earth was mind-blowing when I took a step back from how normalized the whole thing feels.,1,1,1444713930,1444717744
cvxuvq1,0,t1_cvxqtqq,Grommy,"I get it about once every six months. It's actually super-trippy and doesn't feel scary *most* times. There have been a few times when I've woken up with sleep paralysis when I had been sleeping face-down that were a little freaky because my nose and mouth were mostly covered and I couldn't breathe very well. After a minute it brought about, ""oh, shit, am I about to suffocate?""-type thoughts.",1,0,1444713430,1444717744

cvxur7g,0,t1_cvxm2h8,Grommy,"I think part of the dislike for ""preachy vegans"" stems from the fact that there's an undeniable cruelty to the meat industry that we all deliberately ignore in favor of our own preferences. Coming face-to-face with someone who made their lives less comfortable in a way we couldn't highlights our own flaws. I eat meat even though I know it's wrong, and here's someone whose very existence reminds me that I could be better and stronger. As a result, when people say, ""Oh, I don't eat meat"" when you offer them a plat of bacon, someone might get defensive about it because it highlights their own inability to make the world a better, less-cruel place.

And I feel I should include the caveat that I eat meat basically on a daily basis. I've thought about going vegetarian or vegan before because I don't want to pay money to people who literally torture animals, but I haven't done it yet because I enjoy the fruits of that torture.",2,0,1444713106,1444717744

>hurtful to other people.

Personally I don't really see it as a problem. I, as a male, don't feel like my right to exist is being impinged upon. I haven't really been swayed by your argument to be honest, but I appreciate that you've shed a bit of light on the whole thing for me.

One last question, do you see there being a strong parallel between your reaction and the original change? To simplify this example, some person said ""I want to remove bro files because they make me feel uncomfortable,"" and your response is ""I don't like this because I feel it's hurtful."" To my eyes that seems like essentially an identical impetus. Do you think of it this way too, or is there some missing piece that I'm not catching on to?

But seriously once again, thank you for answering my original question. It's probably clear to you that I don't agree with you and few people on this sub will be on ""your side"" (ignoring for now that there are no sides to begin with, just shades of grey), so thanks for at least replying the once.",1,0,1444648216,1444717744
cvwsj89,0,t1_cvwcduo,Grommy,"Serious question, I hope you answer: why does it matter to you (or anyone) if they're called bro files vs br files? If someone else is uncomfortable and making them comfortable literally changes nothing for you, why not make them comfortable?",2,0,1444646539,1444717744

cvwf0vp,1,t3_3od6vl,Grommy,"When I was young, my family got two cats from the same litter. We named them Tom & Jerry because we thought they were both boys. We later found out that Jerry was female, so we re-christened her Geraldine. Loved my old Ger-bear :')",1,0,1444610939,1444717744
cvwexa0,0,t1_cvweqfi,Grommy,"Pu'erh is probably my least favorite tea! The ""barnyard"" scent is too much for me and even when it tastes great after being steeped I still can't get past the smell. Though I have had a few Pu'erh-eque teas that were really good--not sure how to describe it, but last time I was in Beijing I bought a non-fermented disc of pu'erh that was made of white tea and that was really fantastic.

Oolongs are super great but personally if it's not a really, really nice oolong (read: expensive af), I'd rather just drink bai mudan haha. (You're probably noticing a common through-line here~)",1,0,1444610754,1444717744
