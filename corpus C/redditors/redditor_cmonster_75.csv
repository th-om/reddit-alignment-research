cvmatlp,0,t1_cvlw8oq,cmonster_75,My wife's favorite drink is a radler (German version of a shandy) and we've tried a few different ones. Stiegl grapefruit is my favorite but we just make our own at home with Weihenstephaner Original Premium and Lorina sparkling lemonade. She likes a 2:1 ratio but I'll make my own just topping off the beer with a little bit of lemonade. Very refreshing in the summer.,1,0,1443831701,1444727951
cvma5r1,1,t3_3n9ayn,cmonster_75,The concept does not sound at all appealing and the fact that Coolhaus did it makes it sound even worse. I've never been very impressed with their normal offerings and their popularity mystifies me.,2,0,1443830344,1444727951
