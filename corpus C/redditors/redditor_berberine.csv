cvuuddm,0,t1_cvusoi8,berberine,"Actually, I'm in western Nebraska, near [these guys](http://www.kelleybean.com/). I think everything that grows in the southeast is in danger. Unfortunately, people don't think about farmers or farms or anything about food until they are in the grocery store. 

When the prices rise on goods, they'll just say the farmers are greedy and want more money, forgetting about the rains, droughts, and/or hurricanes that affect prices too.",1,0,1444491942,1444719935
cvup6ec,0,t1_cvukywk,berberine,"As a non-farmer, this makes me sad. Then again, I live in an area where everyone is worried about the sugar beet harvest. We've had lots of rain and the harvesting has stopped this week until the fields dry out. 

My area of America also has corn, sunflowers, beans (so many types), alfalfa, cattle and lots of other crops I'm forgetting about right now.

EDIT: I probably shouldn't have put cattle in with all the other crops, but I'm not changing it.",10,0,1444477855,1444719935
cvup0rf,0,t1_cvuioom,berberine,"My neighbors set off fireworks the last two nights and woke me up in the middle of the night. Last night they had a party and their kids were still up at midnight when they woke me up. The kids were running around screaming and giggling like kids do.

I cursed them and was angry. Didn't call the cops. I'm almost sure they were watching the MLB playoffs.",1,0,1444477213,1444719935

cvospoe,0,t1_cvongwv,berberine,"Reminds me of the young man I worked with who had muscular dystrophy. At the first IEP meeting of the year, his foster mom asked about his grades and looked right at me and said, ""I can assume these are his real grades now?""

Up until 5th grade, he got straight As in everything. When I took over his grades varied between B, C, D depending on the class.

I looked her straight in the eye and told her, ""Well I was hired to scribe for him, not do his work for him."" This position was fine while he was in elementary school. In junior high, there was pressure from admin for me to do more of his work. That, among other issues with the district is why I quit.

EDIT: I must add that he didn't need FC to communicate. He was just a lazy kid like all other kids.",6,0,1444043944,1444719935
cvn695r,0,t1_cvmsk4v,berberine,"And while people are spending some time living in a major metropolitan city, those city folks should come live where I do. In the middle of nowhere. I moved here to get away from city life, which I spent most of my life living in.

Out here, there are many people with mental health issues, but services are difficult because so much goes to the two major cities in the states while we make do with what we have.

Everyone should have to live in someone else's shoes for a while and maybe we'd all have a little more empathy and help people out.",3,0,1443910509,1444719935

cvdm6qc,0,t1_cvdb0r0,berberine,"I used to work as a paraeducator in the local school district and SLD was the most abused diagnosis around.

Really good at basketball, but refuse to do the work, but the school wants you to play? SLD

Kid shows up 2 days a week, if we're lucky. SLD Then he gets to full 9-week marking period to complete all assignments.

Every single kid that had an SLD was a behavioral problem not a true learning disability.

The girl with cerebral palsy worked her ass off. The kid that was missing a small part of his brain worked his ass off. The kid whose IQ was at 71 worked his ass off. Give me these kids any day and get rid of the damned SLD.

I couldn't take it anymore and quit after six years. The following year, there were 16 special education kids. 12 were SLD.",1,0,1443178940,1444719935
