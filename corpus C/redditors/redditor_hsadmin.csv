cvxh1ku,0,t1_cvxew2f,hsadmin,That's exactly how she described it.  Like crunching rice krispies.  I was the one person my father forgot to warn before I saw her and when I went in I thought I was in the wrong room. ,2,0,1444689924,1444727958
cvxdonq,0,t1_cvx2hy2,hsadmin,"My mother had surgery to have a lobe of one of her lungs removed. Her lung apparently wasn't stapled properly and leaked air when she breathed. It gave her subcutaneous emphysema and she had air trapped between the skin and tissue over her entire body. She was unrecognizable, like someone blew her up with a bicycle pump. It took several days for it to go away.  Absolutely horrifying. Her eyes were even swollen shut. ",1,0,1444684688,1444727958
cvt09pr,0,t1_cvsx0jt,hsadmin,And wouldn't it be weird if a speaker that represents no constituents got to vote but DC's rep doesn't?,2,0,1444341795,1444727958
cvssfp9,0,t1_cvsredz,hsadmin,I'm going to do something fairly unprecedented on Reddit and admit that you make a very compelling argument and I agree with you.,30,0,1444330252,1444727958
cvsr5j0,0,t1_cvspdhe,hsadmin,"To be fair... Chuck Johnson (who's site that is) has very little credibility. Not to say it isn't true, he's gotten a few things right but just because he stands by the story doesn't make it more credible. The reason it isn't a mainstream story is because actual mainstream news outlets won't touch a story like that when the only evidence they have is an unsubstantiated rumor.",21,0,1444328394,1444727958
cvsqoqa,0,t1_cvsot5y,hsadmin,Thanks. I'm aware of that but that wasn't my question. ,2,0,1444327749,1444727958
cvsnudo,0,t1_cvsnlr1,hsadmin,My question is would they get paid the full speaker salary? Would they be a full member of Congress with the ability to vote?,9,0,1444323635,1444727958
cvsnmi1,0,t1_cvsmr5x,hsadmin,My guess is that he realized that even if he could get the votes the job wouldn't be worth it. Probably the smartest move he could have made.,26,0,1444323307,1444727958
cvh58r5,0,t1_cvh1r8d,hsadmin,That was his pacifier and that was actually the smartest part of the video to me. Pretty sure he threw it off first because he was aware that if he didn't he wouldn't be able to reach it. ,1,0,1443464827,1444727958
cvgzu04,0,t1_cvgwt0u,hsadmin,"I was stoked about the series for like 55 minutes and in the last 5 minutes I was like ""wtf just happened?"" It seemed like they shot the whole pilot and then decided they wanted to take it a different direction. It was weird. Like there aren't enough ""troubled genius solves crimes for skeptical police"" shows.",11,0,1443456746,1444727958
