Whistleblowing would be going to internal and/or external government offices, such as the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Special Counsel, to bring up instances of wrongdoing. Going to the press, as Manning (and Snowden) did, isn't considered whistleblowing and is a violation of the Espionage Act. So that's why he was punished.",1,1,1444720734,1444723259
cvxwmms,0,t1_cvxpdzz,BobTagab,"> I mean requesting extradition following the established treaty with the U.K. has to be easier than an elaborate plot involving two rape allegations, a number of corrupt prosecutors and a European arrest warrant in order to get him into Sweden to THEN request extradition anyway right?

Plus extraditing him from Sweden would require both Sweden and the UK to approve the extradition to the US. 

But that won't happen. Why? Because the US is not pursuing charges against him, and they haven't been. Assange is just hiding from rape charges and using the US as this boogeyman to draw up support from people who blindly follow him. All the dude cares about is his ego and he makes shit up to make himself seem more important.

What point? That polls currently show Sanders beating any potential Republican nominee? They aren't.

Edit: Yeah, out of 356 sponsored bills only three of his became laws. Two of those are the House and Senate versions to rename a post office and one which increased disability compensation for veterans. He has co-sponsored 206 other bills.

He's even proposed his universal health care and free college tuition bills which have never gained a single co-sponsor from the Democrats.

Sure, I respect the guy for sticking to his guns, but I want a President who is willing to work with both parties to achieve something and isn't on the fringe of either party that he (or she) alienates the majority of Congress and jack shit gets done.",3,0,1444125064,1444723259

Clinton would at least have the draw and support of moderate democrats (and with the fracturing of the GOP between the establishment and the Tea Party she'll probably draw some moderate Republicans in Congress) which Sanders will never get. 

Sure, Sanders might be consistent in his positions and voting but he barely has any support in Congress for what he wants to push and without the support of Congress he won't be able to get shit done as a President.

Politics is all about compromise. If Sanders isn't willing to do that then you're right, everything will stay exactly the same.
