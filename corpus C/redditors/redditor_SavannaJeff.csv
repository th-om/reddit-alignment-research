Then a country can do anything and claim it's on 'ecological grounds'. ""Oh, we stole your factories and assets? Ecological grounds, but we own them now and we're using them"".",1,1,1444708451,1444718442

cvx9zae,0,t1_cvx7mw8,SavannaJeff,">Alright, you have given my a bit of perspective, but I'm still not for the agreement, especially not before we'll get to see the text. Some reasons:

I agree. No one should support the agreement until the text is released. But it's a bit silly to oppose it before seeing what it contains, which is the majority

>Additionally, when Ecuador terminated its contract with Occidental Petroleum because they violated their contract (and due to protests, again because of the violation and alleged human rights abuse), Oxy sued and won ""the largest award ever to have been issued by an ICSID tribunal"", S$2.3 billion with interest applied. Now, these are just single cases, but they are representative for what I think is currently the problem with ISDS and what has to be worked on, which is currently being done in the UN as I understand.

Oxy deserved to win. One of the parts of ISDS is that punishment ought to be proportionate. Oxy won the case because the punishment was way outside what it should have been. There's a [great write up explaining the nuances here](http://kluwerarbitrationblog.com/blog/2012/12/19/icsids-largest-award-in-history-an-overview-of-occidental-petroleum-corporation-v-the-republic-of-ecuador/). It's also not the largest award, the largest is in the Yukos oil case against Russia, where they were awarded fifty billion. As to the others, I recognize that there are significant issues with ISDS and undeveloped countries. But that's not the case with the TPP, nor with TTIP, and the recent proposals by the EU for TTIP with respect to ISDS go as far as creating an international court with permanent judges and huge transparency initiatives (more so than in regular courts, sometimes).

>Again very insightful, but I still think that the negotiations should be public and uninfluenced by the interests of single companies, i.e. politicians not relying on their money and ignoring their complaints if they are not founded on public interests. To use your example, there was probably a rational reason to 'lower dairy tariffs', or else it wouldn't stand in the negotiations. Now I realize that that is impossible, but I think protesting against secrecy is the lesser of two evils here.

You're assuming first, that only companies lobby, second, that lobbying is inherently bad, and third, that the public is much smarter than they are. The simple fact of the matter is that NGOs lobby, unions lobby, companies lobby, and in the overwhelming majority of cases it's just putting forward the view of that organization. I mean, do you really want to curtail free speech for this kind of matter?",1,0,1444679445,1444718442
cvx9kvt,0,t1_cvx7u9n,SavannaJeff,">I appreciate that TTIP is much more than a simple FTA, but there's no real mandate. Whether people understand it or not doesn't change that it's unpopular, and LIKE YOU SAY, it's preposterous to expect it to represent UK national interests first.

Well of course it's ridiculous to represent British interests first. But the UK gains by basically having a veto over the agreement, all they have to do is say ""no"", and negotiators know this so they negotiate with what's politically feasible for the UK in mind. And that is considerably more than what the UK could get in a bilateral agreement with the US because it's *very well* established that larger economies win out in negotiations most of the time. The idea that the UK could make agreements as good for itself outside of the EU is just ludicrous, and not supported at all by academia.",0,0,1444678867,1444718442
