cvvcivt,1,t3_3o9qdw,O-Shag-Hennessy,"Bill Snyder, can you talk to Bob Stoops about how to prepare for big games? I think he's forgotten. ",6,0,1444525765,1444720961
cvv39p1,0,t1_cvv1z8i,O-Shag-Hennessy,"Stoops has been at Oklahoma since 1999 and Les at LSU since 2005. Stoops has won a championship and every major bowl and he's past Switzer in wins at OU. Stoops isn't hungry anymore and the passion just doesn't seem like it's their. It was like pulling teeth to get him to let go of his OC and hire someone from the outside instead of just promoting someone inside. If it weren't for disgruntled fans, Heupel would probably still be their. The recruiting isn't competing well with Baylor and TCU either. Another 8-4 season won't cut it again. I want him to be successful and I love him, but I don't want Oklahoma to end up like Texas because we waited too long to let go of a coach who has become complacent. ",1,0,1444508406,1444720961
cvv2x44,0,t1_cvv1u70,O-Shag-Hennessy,"He better be, but I have the feeling Castiglione and Stoops want to grow old together. Stoops may pull a Bobby Bowden and stay forever and Castiglione won't say shit about it. ",1,0,1444507777,1444720961
cvv2oxm,0,t1_cvv2fnj,O-Shag-Hennessy,"If we go 8-4 or worse then yes he needs to go. Texas should be a lesson to everyone that you can't let a coach stay too long and become complacent. The fire and passion has to be their and I don't think the fire is gonna last too long for Stoops. He's won every major bowl and a championship, there's not much I don't know what else is pushing him to be more successful. I love him, but I don't want him to pull a Bobby Bowden.
