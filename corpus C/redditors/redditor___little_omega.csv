cv5ljsy,1,t3_3kwtsw,__little_omega,Almost every Hindu article seems to suffer from extensive editorialization. The one-sided narrative is so jarring and in this example it seems that the author who is knowledgeable on the topic of Sanskrit prevalence in mughal courts is made to say things which Hindu wanted to publish anyway.,3,0,1442555558,1444726664

cuh8dn5,1,t3_3goha6,__little_omega,"The court's concerns regarding UID can be basically summarized as

1. In the court's opinion the integration of an identification mechanism has privacy issues. Privacy issues are explained in this article to be related to be the particular case where the State is enabled to spy on its Citizens.
2. Using Aadhar in various other schemes by the government. This could lead to Aadhar gradually becoming the primary mode of identification.

On face value, both of these seem to facile reasons to reject Aadhar or any other UID attempt. 
If Reason (1) was truly a concern then shouldn't it apply to every aspect of data collection by the Government, including the demographic census? At the very least, the court could have advocated stringent control on access to the data.
Regarding reason (2) why is the court fixated on reducing the usage of Aadhaar as a mode of identification? 

I am anticipating the following rebuttal to my own questions -  If Aadhaar is like every other identification mechanism why do we need one more when we have so many already? 
The reason I think Aadhaar is necessary is that none of those mechanisms are as effective as Aadhaar. In a country like India, where ensuring that Government schemes/benefits reach to the common man is extremely difficult, Aadhaar is the only idea that has a chance of working. It is good to have concerns regarding the threat to privacy that Aadhaar might bring with it but it is much more prudent to have checks and measures to ensure privacy than to shelve a perfectly good solution that can hopefully ensure it's citizens' other basic rights.",0,0,1440660082,1444726664
cueust3,1,t3_3iarxv,__little_omega,"Of all the subreddits that I frequent, I find /r/India has the highest propensity for debate. However, I think that the quality of debate (mostly political) can be improved. The following are two behaviors that I wish can be changed here. 

1. Equating a person with a party and equating a party with the GoI is something that bothers me. Just as one should not justify a person/party's shortcomings with circuitous logic (""bhakt"" and other variations), it is reasonable to expect that we blame the right agent for a particular action. 
I do realize that this is not so much an oft repeated opinion as much as the thinking behind most opinions; yet it irks me. 

2. Another behavior that I do not agree with is that most posts here deliver a verdict than invite others for a discussion. When you make a post please provide a justification or at least an explanation of your perspective, so that if someone wants to offer a rebuttal they can actually understand where you are coming from.",15,0,1440487897,1444726664
cu741qd,1,t3_3he7up,__little_omega,"Not sure if I'm too late to the party but I am always confused between when to use 'bring' vs 'take'. E.g. if we're meeting up afterwards, you could ask me if I will be bringing X to the meeting. If we're going our separate ways and not meeting afterwards, in my head I should be 'taking' X from this place and not 'bringing' X to wherever I'm going.",1,0,1439911658,1444726664
