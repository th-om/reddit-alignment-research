Wasn't my assertion, I was just jumping in.

>And to prove that, you need sources for the largest pro-life political movements spending some sizable portion of their budget supporting organizations like Lifecall and Gabrielnetwork and similar.

These organizations exist at regional and local levels all around the country. Most (if not all) Catholic diocese have a similar outreach and support program, and I'd be surprised if other church organizations didn't as well.

I can't provide numerical sources at the moment regarding amounts of money spent.

However, the Church spends minimal financial resources on anti-abortion messages, mostly relying on manpower as its resource. The March for Life is a massive event held annually in DC, but its not like they run commercials or anything.

On the other hand, these local aid groups receive a lot of resources through direct donation of things like clothes and food, and are staffed heavily by volunteers.

None of that really addresses the fact that many conservatives feel that these groups are better suited and more efficient and effective at addressing the needs, and don't view their opposition to government-run social services as inconsistent or hypocritical. You can disagree, and you might be correct, but they believe the views are logically consistent.",5,0,1444683752,1444716330
