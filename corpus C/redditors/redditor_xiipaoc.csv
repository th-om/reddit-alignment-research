It was a few years later when I realized that, yeah, I was probably not the one who actually invented that.",7,0,1444705897,1444720836
cvxqlzy,1,t3_3oispe,xiipaoc,"Yeah, nobody gives a shit about your résumé or your cover letter.  That's the simple fact of the matter.  Anyone who *does* care will only care if they see you have the required qualifications and experience.  Unless you're doing something *really* interesting with your materials, nobody will give any shits whatsoever.  Those five to six hours you spend on each one?  Completely wasted.

So: have *one* résumé.  Just one.  Make it good, though.  Make sure it doesn't have a Bullshit section on top.  Mine used to, and I applied for jobs over and over and over and never got even acknowledged.  Then I cut the Bullshit section and added a Projects section, and I got hired, like, two weeks later.  A recruiter found me -- two recruiters, actually -- and one of them found me a company that was hiring inexperienced people in my field, and I was hired!  I sucked at it.  I got fired.  Some other desperate company hired me.  I sucked at it at first, then I got better.  Then I got laid off because the company's product was really terrible and they dropped the product altogether.  Recruiters found my résumé and found me several places to work.  I interviewed; I got rejected from a bunch.  Then one of them took me.  Now I work there and don't suck at it nearly as much as I did three years ago at the first company; instead, I'm doing quite well!

All because I took out the Bullshit section.  In the Bullshit section were things like the fact that I'm a competitive problem solver, good at communication and teamwork, etc.  I hadn't actually labeled it ""Bullshit"", but I might as well have done, because that's what it was.

Anyway, stop obsessing over your résumés and cover letters.  Make *one* good résumé (maybe two if you're applying to very different industries) and post that on Monster or whatever, and make your cover letters short enough that you don't waste time on them, because nobody wants to waste time reading your shit.  And spend your funemployed free time on things that actually matter -- do some personal projects in your field.  And brag about them on your résumé.  Nobody gives a shit about your cover letter or your résumé -- so make them give a shit about what you actually *do*.  That's what's actually important.",2,0,1444705046,1444720836
cvxq1gj,0,t1_cvxmept,xiipaoc,"No, you don't.  Tell them the truth.  You were only a temp, and your temporary time is up.  You're excited to move on to new opportunities.  If they ask you why you aren't staying with the company, then you can tell them the truth -- they're not hiring full-time positions, and you want to work full-time.  It's a sad situation, but it's what it is.  $500/week with no benefits is basically jack shit, and you're doing hard work.  That's actually a completely valid reason to leave.  You offered to stay but they didn't want to hire you.",4,0,1444704119,1444720836

Actually, Europeans when speaking English would call Yiddish ""Jewish"".

He was talking about Yiddish.  So while it's not necessarily the most descriptive term, especially since there are many other Jewish languages around, it is a term that's used for Yiddish.",5,0,1444618917,1444720836
