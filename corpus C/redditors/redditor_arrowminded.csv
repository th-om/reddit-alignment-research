cvrl53m,1,t3_3nu4nc,arrowminded,Right out of my CS undergrad I went on an interview for a entry-level  engineering role at a finance corp. The interviewer introduces himself and then asks me if I knew what an h1-b is. I said yeah ive heard of it. He then tells me that theres no future in software engineering and technology for americans because the jobs will be outsourced and insourced to india. i wanted to kick him out of the 38th story window. But i kept my composure and completed the interview. did not get the job obviously.,3,0,1444244243,1444729316
