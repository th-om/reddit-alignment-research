The struggle for a united Ireland was simply the most obvious solution to the tyranny of the British and Unionists, after all attempts to work within the legal and political framework of the UK failed to achieve anything. The point of the troubles, for the IRA, was to fight back against unionist thuggery and oppression.

The point of the GFA was not to guarantee self determination, it was to create a new state in NI that nationalists could participate in as equals.",0,0,1444589302,1444717604

> bombing civillians into joining your country because they wont vote the way you like...

This does not in any sense accurately describe the troubles. Not in motive, not in tactics. The only group that really fits is the unionist terrorists and thugs whose goal was to terrify a population into accepting their tyranny and whose chosen methods were targeting civilians in the most brutal of manners.",3,0,1444581529,1444717604

cvvrkz9,0,t1_cvvqtuw,redem,Sure. My only point is that there was no higher ideal of democratic self-determination at play. It was a play to keep hold of as much land as possible on the flimsiest pretence.,2,0,1444569364,1444717604

Diane was not wrong, either. Unionism in NI was pretty similar to white supremacist ideologies, though protestant, unionist supremacism.",6,0,1444561924,1444717604
