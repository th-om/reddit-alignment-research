cvs2kh9,0,t1_cvs15f5,AnthemIcarus,"The previous recession was not some grand market failure through and through. You cannot interfere in the market, and then claim that it was a market failure.

The 2008 recession was spurred on in large part by government entities encouraging home ownership by guaranteeing bad loans. If you remember, George Bush and even Bill Clinton took pride at the time by bragging that America had the highest rate of home ownership to date. It was their administrations that pushed the market into territories it would not normally go to by manipulating interest rates and encouraging lending. That was actually the express purpose of Bush's administration.

My main point is it would be misleading to leave out the Federal government's part in creating a bubble in the previous recession and purely saying that this was a market failure is not totally accurate.",4,0,1444271819,1444716530

cvq5o15,1,t3_3npin7,AnthemIcarus,"If done correctly, a gradual winding down of US involvement in key areas if possible with support from our allies. Western Europe has long been a free rider on US military. Those countries would need to start spending appropriate amounts for their own self defense. 

When Europe begins spending enough, it will be easier for the US to withdraw troops. Some areas will require the United States to continue to exert influence, like Japan, Australia, or Africa. It is noteworthy to say that these allies should be militarizing as well. However, Western European countries are capable of squaring off with Russia in Eastern Europe, the US with European allies are capable of keeping a beat on the Middle East. 

Essentially, US world involvement rarely makes the United States ""safer"" but generally just exerts control of trade, which is an ancillary benefit if not THE benefit of stationing military in a country. I firmly believe that our allies are capable of defending themselves without plunging the world into another world war and I don't necessarily buy into the notion that the United States will destroy world peace if they draw back some forces militarily. With an evolving global economy I think the long term picture will be one of more trade and less military. It's all around bad for business to start large scale wars and I think the world is learning that.",5,0,1444145192,1444716530
cvq58iz,0,t1_cvq2gvj,AnthemIcarus,"Look at the history of the USSR. Marxism was always framed as an economic and social movement pushed by the ""intelligentsia"".

I am certainly not impressed by someone who says that ""progress"" is good. No political movement has started and gained traction by telling people they were going to go backwards. Every single political movement has claimed to be progress. Stalin claimed progress in his speeches in the late 30's. Venezuelans claimed progress until a year ago. Hitler claimed progress. Mao claimed progress. But what is progress? How can you claim a monopoly on progress by simply labeling yourself a ""progressive"". 

This is the same logic used to say ""don't be on the wrong side of history"". You have absolutely no idea what the right side of history will be, just as those who lived on the ""wrong"" side of history in the past did not.",2,0,1444144497,1444716530

cvn5xjn,0,t1_cvmwtz8,AnthemIcarus,"Okay so look, if you're a person, we can all agree you have rights. And if you have rights there are things I can't do to you. So we need to define who is and isn't a person. So we want to decide this. If one mother says ""yes this clump of cells is a person"" and another says ""no this clump of cells is not a person"" they cannot simultaneously both be right. A person's rights are completely indifferent to how another person feels about them. The status of personhood cannot be so arbitrarily defined because it's made up of no real actual defining characteristic. If I showed you a picture of a late term fetus and asked you if that was a person you wouldn't be able to answer my question without asking the mother. You have totally skirted my question in favor of a completely subjective viewpoint that has no bearing in reality. Who gives a shit what the mother thinks is a person and is not? Why would this standard be held to any other regard? Oh sorry your honor I killed him because I decided he wasn't a person. Women and mothers don't get to decide what is and is not a person. We as a society need to define what is and is not a person and you're goddamn right I'm comfortable drawing a line and protecting rights from then on. The alternative that you have taken is rooted in nothing but a subjective choice, meaningless, has no actual characteristics outside an arbitrary notion of how a mother feels.

If you let a singular person decide what is and is not a person you will not only get a million different answers, you will get a lot of uninformed answers, you will get a lot of arbitrary answers, and you will above all else get answers influenced by situations. So yes, leaving a subjective notion of what a woman believes to be a child up to her is ridiculous because feeling and belief does not trump an actual definition of personhood grounded in development and consciousness. Personhood is an objective measurable characteristic not some subjective thing used as a convenience when a woman feels like it's the right thing to do to murder her child. 

That's about all I'm saying on the topic because this is a pointless discussion with someone who is out to vilify me as someone who wants to oppress women.",1,0,1443909899,1444716530

>There's a ballpark, at best, concerning consciousness

I don't mean to shake your autism here but the socially accepted meaning of a ""ballpark"" figure is one that isn't very good.

>My logical conclusion is that the abortion will take place long before ""A DAY"" before birth. My logical conclusion, will be that it will happen as soon as the clinic has an opening.

Which forces you to also accept that SOME FUCKING WON'T. It's just statistical. So if we have information on when a brain forms, if we can define a point in which many in society feel as if life begins based on observable facts, then my question to you is why not define it then?

You have repeatedly skirted my personhood question, and there can be no progress if you cannot formulate an answer to the most basic fact at the center of the abortion debate: what characteristic separates a human life from a non human life, and what characteristics necessitate we bestow rights? If you can't articulate any definite meaning of life or human rights or what a human being is then you're operating on a really basic level of this debate.
