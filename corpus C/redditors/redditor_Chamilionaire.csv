Only someone who really really loves kids (and probably with the intention of having some too with the mother) would want marry into to raising someone else's kids.  I have zero (and haven't married at age 31), but I'd imaging divorced fathers probably have it better than mothers just because custody is so often awarded to mothers for the majority of the time.",2,0,1444346139,1444720505

cvsclav,0,t1_cvrt6am,Chamilionaire,Started in CS.  Switched to information systems over in the school of business after 1.5 years.  Best decision of my life.  You could focus in App Dev or Bus Analyst or Network Admin. But the other classes were so SO much easier. I went from getting Cs to the Deans Honor list after the switch ,1,0,1444302516,1444720505

cvrj7f7,0,t1_cvr9loi,Chamilionaire,"Just take off the quarter round molding, not the whole trim.  Then paint the walls.. life will be easiest during sanding if you still use a dropcloth but not end of world if you get some on the floor.

Then sand/stain the floors.  Just get close enough to the molding that the quarter round molding will cover up to 3/4 inches off the wall or so.  

Then reinstall quarter round molding.  It's way easier with a nailgun.  Normally people would paint it outside, reinstall it, then caulk, then paint the caulk, which is a pain in the ass.  If you want the easiest/fastest route, you can pick up stained quarter round molding that matches your floors [like this](https://justinkays.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_5092.jpg).  Available at any big hardware store.  Some probably comes stained, some not.  I'd do it outside then install.  Don't even need to worry about nail holes, as it's a darker color and you can hardy see them.

FYI - I founding sanding floors in an old ass house to be a HUGE pain in the ass.  I don't know how old your floor is.  Mine is 100 years old.  It came out terrible, I rented a sander for 3 days and the floors were SO humped.  I ended up not sanding it as much as I should have and ended up covering up with vinyl.  Next time I'll get a pro.  If the current floors are currently in good shape, I'd try as hard AS HELL to find a wood/color match at the store first before refinishing all of them.
