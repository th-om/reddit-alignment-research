cvws7z2,0,t1_cvwo4nm,aussiemourinho,"Seconded. I'm currently reading Robert Caro's series on him and it's absolutely fascinating, from both a political and psychological perspective. The guy was brilliant, yet without a moral compass. Extraordinarily extroverted, yet deeply conflicted and unconfident on the inside. Without a doubt up there as one of the best, if not the best political operators of the 20th century. ",11,0,1444645137,1444717107
cvwcn75,0,t1_cvwbxsa,aussiemourinho,"First of all, the boss pays you less than $20 because he has the skills or the organisation in place in order to facilitate the work that must take place in order for the service to be provided. If you were able to draw customers in to pay you $20 per hour for the same service, without the business owners' help, you would. However, employees are either not in a position to do such a thing, or are not motivated to do so, therefore they work for someone else. 

You seem to think that business owners should do the above for free. That they should facilitate whatever service is being provided, but not be remunerated for it at all. You're forgetting all the work that they have to put in, on top of the work that is done by their employees. They have to handle advertising, they have to handle accounting and taxes. They have to deal with business laws and regulations, and have to manage their staff. They often have to deal with unhappy customers or clients. Crucially, they have to have had the money to put down in the first place in order to get the business started, and they have to have had the willingness to take such a risk with their finances. 

Considering the above, why would anyone put in such work without receiving a decent chunk of the profit? At the end of the day, it is the business owner who takes all the risk. It is the business owner who has to put his money where his mouth is. It is the business owner who has to initiate and develop the organisation from the get go. 

What you are advocating for would result in one thing, and one thing only. There would be no business. Therefore there would be no jobs supplied by said business. Therefore, the person in your scenario, instead of earning, say, $12/hour, with the boss taking $8/hour off each employee, would instead earn $0/hour. 

Doesn't seem like an improvement to me. ",0,0,1444606399,1444717107
cvurtyx,0,t1_cvuq2e1,aussiemourinho,"<To be honest, what is a ""leftist"" and a ""rightist""?

The easiest way to break it down is to swap 'leftist' and 'rightist' out for 'liberal' and 'conservative', respectively. The terms aren't technically 100% interchangeable, however, they are much more easily defined and understood, whilst the same principles hold true most of the time. 

Another important thing to remember is that there are massive differences within both groups, and some views can't even be measured on a left-right/liberal-conservative spectrum. 

However, to break the two terms down into very general terms, **Liberals** tend to believe the following:

 - Aim to remove any class structures present in society. Liberals believe that class systems, by definition are destructive and that they lead to inequality. 

- Believe that the government should, in general, intervene in the lives of citizens and the way businesses function (e.g. more liberal in handing out welfare, redistribute wealth through higher taxes, implement affirmative action policies, implement more corporate and business regulations). 

- Believe that free trade should be limited at times, and that pure capitalism is corrupt, and favours only the already wealthy and powerful. 

- Believe in scaling back military (this is very general, and is not always the case, however is the case in some major democracies at the moment, such as the US, UK, Australia), and letting other countries fight their own battles. Often reject the good-evil dichotomy in foreign policy. 

- Tend to dislike tradition, whether it be religious or social, and view social issues such as gay marriage, abortion, the complete removal of religious references from government, and more open borders as positive effectors on society (again, there is some variation in these views amongst liberals). 

**Conservatives** tend to believe the following:

- That class structures, whilst not always ideal, are necessary in order for society to function. Conservatives generally believe that class systems, when coupled with opportunity for people to move up them, are positive in the sense that they may motivate individuals to work hard and be responsible for there own lives and destinies. 

- Believe that the government should, whenever possible, remove itself from the lives of citizens, by reducing government welfare/social security, reducing taxes on citizens and businesses, removing affirmative action policies, and reducing corporate and business regulations. 

- Believe in free markets and free trade in the vast majority of situations, and believe that capitalism, whilst not necessarily perfect, is the best system the world has seen. Believe that capitalism provides an incentive for individuals to be personally responsible and to work hard in order to rise up the food chain. 

- Believe in maintaining a strong military, and generally believe in a good-evil dichotomy, where the west + Israel is good, and any countries fighting against us are evil. 

- Value tradition, and believe that it has a place in our society. Believe that we should maintain and be proud of Christianity as a part of our culture, and generally oppose gay marriage and abortion. Believe that borders should be closed, and that all immigration should occur only after the vetting of all immigrants. ",1,0,1444486269,1444717107
cvuf2u0,1,t3_3o62eb,aussiemourinho,"Nobody wants to come out and hedge their bets on a candidate who may drop out soon, as doing so would kind of make them look like chumps. Once the field has thinned out to maybe 6 or less candidates, endorsements will pick up, as the endorsers will be more confident of their chosen candidate winning.

You can also see, by looking at the graphs, that in all races from 2004 onwards, endorsements spiked massively from Iowa onwards. Chances are, shortly after Iowa we will see a much smaller field (therefore the trend will continue) as Santorum, Jindal, Rand Paul, Huckabee, and maybe even Carson will all drop out if they lose in that state (I think Cruz will either win Iowa or stay in anyway), bringing the number of candidates down to a maximum of 10.

cvtmjb0,0,t1_cvtkcwl,aussiemourinho,"kevinbaconjames hit the nail on the head. Biden projects an image of a man several years younger than he actually is, whilst just by looking at Sanders it would be reasonable to estimate his age as older than he actually is. From my perspective though, whilst they may be physically and mentally able at the moment, who can say how they will be in 9 years time (when they would leave office if they were reelected), as 82 and 83 year olds. The decline can be rapid at that age. ",7,0,1444395268,1444717107
cvtk8q0,1,t3_3o2qco,aussiemourinho,"Not a democrat myself, but I would hazard a guess that the vast majority of democrats in such a position would have the same or a very similar answer.

- Find Bernie Sanders to be too extreme in terms of policy. Some may also be put off by his age. ",8,0,1444388510,1444717107
cvsjfid,0,t1_cvsfnvy,aussiemourinho,"You don't just click your fingers and become a doctor you know. It's a long, hard, often lonely road that takes incredible discipline from a young age. When many people are out partying their college years away, many med school hopefuls work their arses off in hope of a better future. You then endure four years of medical school, one of the most intense courses available. Medical school doesn't even nearly qualify you to practice independently as a doctor - you have to spend at least 1 year as an intern, then around 5-7 years as a Resident/Registrar, where you work 100+ hour weeks on a regular basis, especially if you are a trainee in a specialty such as Neurosurgery, which Carson was. Once you finish your Residency, if you want to become well respected within your field, you spend two years doing a fellowship, which is essentially an extension of your Residency, only this time you sub-specialise within your field. Add those years up, and the earliest you can start practicing independently in a surgical sub-specialty is around the age of 33. 

So yes, he may have spent the last thirty years as one of the most well respected people in medicine, but in order to get there, he, like many other physicians and surgeons, took a pass on what many consider to be 'the best years of your life' (20s and early 30s), in order to get to where he is today. 

By the way, Obama wasn't just 'a community organiser'. You make it sound like he was living it rough. The guy was a Harvard Law School Professor - no doubt that took effort too, but he wasn't slumming it during that period either. ",2,0,1444317089,1444717107
