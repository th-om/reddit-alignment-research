cv91xuy,0,t1_cv906ma,BeefSupreme24,"Fair enough.  I feel like these questions can really be trick questions as almost any fiscal solution anyone takes could be picked apart as something that won't fix our problems, especially short term.  I think we only really have long term solutions at this point.  

In the short term I would support Sanders working to close tax loopholes and combating money in politics.  He's also not a war hawk which will save us money should he become president.  Ending the war on drugs would be another thing he could do to save us money.

I know not everyone agrees but like you mentioned above some of the others only ""seem"" to be more responsible when in reality they could easily be worse than you imagine Bernie to be.",10,0,1442847762,1444725231
