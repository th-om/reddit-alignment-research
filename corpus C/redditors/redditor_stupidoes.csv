cv5c9fv,0,t1_cv5bi8j,stupidoes,That's the narrative he would like you to believe but I know more about this case.  He took a deal in exchange for the dropping of charges and other things an that deal is currently sealed.  It would be a bad investment to bank on that staying sealed.  ,4,0,1442537126,1444728012

When BurtW says they stole the money, he means he gave it to them because he didn't want to go to jail or fight a case he had no chance of winning.",2,0,1442532292,1444728012

cv58xlc,0,t1_cv58mxs,stupidoes,"I agree to an extent.  But BurtW is not a victim here, he knowingly broke the law over a course of at least months, [probably years](https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/BurtW/feedback/) and now he is trying to garner sympathy.  I have zero respect for people who know the consequences for breaking the rules but let greed guide their actions and then cry fowl about it.  
  
How much demonstrating was he out doing against the laws he disagrees with prior to his arrest?
  
Has he ever ran for office in an attempt to put himself in a position to try and make change?
  
How has he tried to change things other than ignoring laws he doesn't agree with?
  
I have a lot of respect for people who break unjust laws at their own expense in order to bring about awareness, but that is not the case here.  His motives were profit driven and he got caught.  And now he's trying to go on speaking tours to profit from it!  hilarious",-3,0,1442531034,1444728012

cv579w1,1,t3_3lbx17,stupidoes,"This source is Burt's wife's blog, a post that you can only find using the way back machine.  She lays out perfectly how they were breaking the law and how long they had been doing it for.  The only question is the exact dollar amounts: https://web.archive.org/web/20150619114257/http://www.jmwagner.com/

>**Burt had a hobby of investing in Bitcoins**.  I do not let Burt commingle his Bitcoins with our personal banking accounts.  Everything related to Bitcoins is kept separate from the rest.  Everything related to Bitcoins was kept in a fire proof Sentry safe high off the floor (because of the 100 year flood and because we have been evacuated for wild fires).  **He has to keep cash on hand to trade Bitcoins.  Burt had an unusually large amount of cash on hand because undercover Federal Agents had been buying Bitcoins from him right and left during the months before our house was raided.**  We were on vacation the weekend before Burt was arrested, so he did not have an opportunity to trade.  We came home Monday night and he was arrested Tuesday morning. 
  
>We had some cash on hand because we had been on vacation nearby at Estes Park.  Also, we are older people and prefer to pay with cash, as do most people whose parents survived The Great Depression.  If you pay with cash you are less likely to overspend.
  
>Speculation:  **More than half of the cash on hand came from the undercover federal agents and Bitcoin trading.**  They were texting us on vacation, trying to get Burt to come to Boulder to trade Bitcoins.  **The feds didn’t realize that Burt wasn’t trading that much, only with them.**  They must have thought he had a large stash of money.  We call Homeland Security the Department of Armed Robbers.  They don’t seem to actually do anything about terrorists. 
  
So this was much more than a hobby like his wife tries to assert.  Burt had an unusually large amount of cash on hand because of selling bitcoins.  And more than half of it was from trading bitcoins.  And he had been doing it for months.  This is coming from people who only transact in cash and own other businesses.  So they are aware of tax laws and reporting requirements and they are using various systems that allow them to obfuscate their activity.  It seems to me that Burt and his wife knew they were breaking the law and they just didn't expect to get caught, probably because they haven't been caught before.
  
Feel free to chime in with your real identity, Burt.  I posted this again because the edgy anarcho capitalists buried it.  I'd love to discuss this with you.

Just like no bodies doesn't mean that Ulbricht didn't try to have people murdered.  I knew that would get downvoted around here because of the hard-on for Ulbricht in this sub but the downvotes also expose the bias as well.
