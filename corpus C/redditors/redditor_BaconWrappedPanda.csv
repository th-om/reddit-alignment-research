cvdue43,1,t3_3mc13d,BaconWrappedPanda,"I'm interested in seeing how the election of a new speaker will play out with the ongoing primary campaign. None of the GOP candidates are members of the House. They are all senators, governors, or other. I think there is an opportunity to treat the open Speaker's seat  as an early primary. ""I have the ability and the right ideology to get my guy elected as Speaker."" I think most of the candidates will prefer to watch from the sidelines saying, ""I encourage the House to elect a strong conservative as the next Speaker."" However, I can definitely see Ted Cruz, who has not hesitated to involve himself in House politics, jumping in and if he does it, opens the doors for others. ",3,0,1443196083,1444723943
cv60d1r,1,t3_3lfl6d,BaconWrappedPanda,"This show reminds me of Cloverfield. I love the universe that's been created here, I just wish that they had made it about characters I could care about. They are all whiney, shallow, one-dimensional characters who are utterly replaceable. I watched the first season and I'd really like to see where the larger story is going, but not enough to sit through another season of these guys. ",2,0,1442594255,1444723943

He returned, somewhat, to his libertarian non-interventionist roots, but I don't think that attitude is going to help him in the current political climate. With Russia, ISIS, Iran and now N. Korea getting regular airtime as the belligerents plaguing us, I think most Americans, Republicans or Democrat, are looking for a more interventionist president at this time.  

I generally liked what he said foreign policy wise, but I don't think it will help him in the polls. ",13,0,1442464219,1444723943
