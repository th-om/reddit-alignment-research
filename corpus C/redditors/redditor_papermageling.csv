cvx0h3e,0,t1_cvx05fh,papermageling,It's helpful for those of us prone to losing things. Much harder to lose something you've got on your wall than a single sheet of paper. ,2,0,1444665398,1444731048
cvwbiqy,1,t3_3oa61h,papermageling,"- Naot shoes are great. Mine are 5 or 6 years old and still pretty comfortable after being worn almost every day (I've probably worn them a total of 1500 days. They've seen *heavy* use) A new pair would be more comfortable, of course, but the Naots are still better than buying another non-Naot shoe would be for me. Also, the leather still looks fine, although I am good about polishing them, and that might have helped. 

- Lands End is pretty good. It's not perfect, but it's decent value, I think. It takes a while to wear out. Boden is comparable. Particularly for smaller plus sizes, where quality is often not good (I'm assuming larger plus sizes have the same issue, but Lands End and Boden don't make for larger plus sizes), LE can be a life saver. 

- LL Bean quality is a step or more above Lands End and Boden, for comparable money. Very little in the way of sales though, whereas you can shop Lands End sales quite effectively. Anyway, the stitching is really nice, and the fabric is as well. They don't have very much that's fashionable, but what you can get there, you should. ",1,0,1444604391,1444731048
cvwb5a9,0,t1_cvvus6o,papermageling,"They provide the actual measurements of the clothing generally, so you can go by that. Otherwise, I'd say order a size smaller than usual. ",2,0,1444603752,1444731048
cvwaz6w,1,t3_3o57vp,papermageling,"Truly sensitive friendly earrings are pretty much titanium or niobium. They're easy enough to swap into the current dangly earrings you might have. Studs are harder: you'll find some on etsy, but you've not got great cheap variety. 

If you're able to wear some earrings, just not the super cheap stuff, silver is good, and for some people, gold (I can wear silver with only mild irritation, but not gold). Silver earrings are not that hard to get cheaply. Gold is more so.",1,0,1444603471,1444731048
cvw82c6,0,t1_cvw4h9h,papermageling,"Not necessarily. I certainly didn't for a while! Regardless, given that covering one's hair is unnecessary for unmarried women, it's not like uncovered hair really stands out much. A scarf stands out a *lot* in a shul where sheitels are the norm. Obviously that doesn't mean that one can't wear one there, but it's definitely the opposite of blending in. Same with hats, although to a lesser degree.",1,0,1444598604,1444731048
cvw41fj,0,t1_cvw1o40,papermageling,"I get that, but I think that figuring out what would work as camouflage would be ridiculously hard for someone not already familiar with their local Orthodox community. Like, I've gone to a shul in south Florida where the women really don't wear much black, and it's not keeping up with the latest fashions that makes you stand out there. And there's a shul near where I am now that definitely doesn't have many people doing color (although they wouldn't judge you for it). ",1,0,1444592496,1444731048
cvw0azh,0,t1_cvvnw4y,papermageling,"Eh, anything past covering knees with a skirt, elbows, and collarbone is getting more into community norms, and not really worth troubling visitors with, I think. Many visitors will have enough trouble covering up enough as is without feeling self conscious about looking dorky (like, before I became frum, my shul appropriate clothing would have been a combination of a summer maxi skirt with a turtleneck. Not something that really works in secular fashion). And asking a visitor to cover their hair is likewise going to be difficult for many, and no one really expects a non-frum visitor to cover their hair. ",3,0,1444586815,1444731048
cvvahpn,0,t1_cvus4ak,papermageling,"> I guess messianic Jews are is kind of the cultural equivalent?

A bit worse, because somehow Christians get the distinction between messiah and God confused, so it's more than just another prophet with bizarre additions, it's literally idolatry.",5,0,1444521861,1444731048
cvsvlfm,1,t3_3o099j,papermageling,"It sounds to me like you signed up for this trip in bad faith. You had zero interest in actually listening to what the people on the trip had to say. 

It's well known that Birthright trips have a specific viewpoint. This should not surprise you or anyone else in the slightest. It doesn't mean that they have nothing worthwhile to say, regardless of what you might believe. 

I went on a very different sort of trip to Israel when I was 16, that was affiliated with the Reconstructionist summer camp. Our guards had a whole range of political stances and opinions, and were generally fascinating to talk to. Our trip set up times for us to meet with various groups, from Jewish children living in the West Bank to Arab teenagers up north. Unfortunately, one of the more memorable encounters with Arabs that we had was when they randomly decided to throw eggs at us. 

Anyway, it's foolish to expect any source of information to be unbiased. 

It's even more foolish to think that you're unbiased and that you really know what the truth is but that everyone else is self-delusional or hiding it from you.  

Instead of trying to push everyone to listen to your views, why don't you try to listen to views you don't agree with and understand where they're coming from? 

I'm not really expecting this to convince you in the slightest, as we have a family friend with similar views, and she's completely strident, unyielding, and close minded on this particular issue. But there is a lot of value to trying to challenge *your own* beliefs, and you just passed up a prime opportunity to do so. ",9,0,1444334844,1444731048
cvs6zae,1,t3_3nw7bl,papermageling,"I do both. Knitting is nicer for clothing, in general, because it drapes and stretches well. Crocheting is much, much better for making stuffed animals. Crocheting also allows for more creativity on the fly, because it's much easier to rip back to a specific point if there's a problem. ",6,0,1444281285,1444731048
