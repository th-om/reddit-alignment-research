cvwehxq,0,t1_cvwcnin,TheNoize,"> Sounds like you got a bad case of butt hurt and are jeolous of other's success.

Success? 

My CEO making $65 million/year is not success, it's an abomination. 

Being born with 4 brothers each with 42 billion in the bank is an abomination of capitalism, when there are more empty houses than homeless people in our country.

What happened to you? We used to be decent people who wanted opportunity for the meek. Republicans used to help those in need. We abolished slavery. When can we think about abolishing this indecent exploitation of working Americans?

cvwc9r7,0,t1_cvwbq1o,TheNoize,"> gay marriage was a supreme Court decision.

Exactly, but at least it benefits a large majority and may stimulate growth. 

But when the supreme Court passed Citizens United, that was a lot more disastrous to the democratic process. So as Republicans, we have to own up to it - the things our party does are not really helping democracy.",-3,0,1444605731,1444728504

Fine, let them. A new collection of US-incorporated, millennial-owned corporations will take over the US economy before the old ones can count their offshore savings.

Then I'm not a conservative, because my family and my children deserve free healthcare and free college. I worked very hard all my life. Time for the rich to pay up.

The Republican party is disintegrating, and instead of actually having some decency towards a fellow Republican, you're shitting on me because I'm not conservative enough for your taste? F*ck you man. 

> Sanders is just like Obama. He appeals to emotions

No - Republicans appeal to emotions. Sanders is appealing to my sense of justice. And you know what? I happen to agree with him. If that bothers you so much, I have nothing else to say.",-4,0,1444601952,1444728504
