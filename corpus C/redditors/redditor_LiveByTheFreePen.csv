cvxs28a,0,t1_cvxrtz1,LiveByTheFreePen,We don't all agree that a human is only a human when it has some arbitrary level of thought capacity that can't be measured or described in any concrete way. ,1,1,1444707481,1444717356
cvxrihw,0,t1_cvxpwu4,LiveByTheFreePen,"I'm not ignoring it. It's just an immaterial question. Unless, of course, you think we should apply that same rule to regular murder. If you don't, you're just arguing in circles. I'm not really interested in this amoral utility-maximizing business or making up bullshit personhood criteria that aren't based on anything other than the need to justify abortion. And I'm willing to treat people like adults and expect them to have some level of responsibility for the predictable outcome of their choices. You're speaking like these people are victims for getting pregnant. ",1,1,1444706531,1444717356
cvxo81k,1,t3_3oiw2c,LiveByTheFreePen,"The only things in that list that I care about would have been done by whoever held her position at the time. America's imperial statecraft just does not impress me. If she wanted to hang on as Secretary of State, fine. But there's nothing about Iran or Libya that makes me want to vote for someone for President. 

And in other news, she has this weird style where she floats between a cold, technocratic progressivism and a half-baked economic populism. And then she tries to hop onto trendy social justice issues in a way that seems affected. None of it is appealing. She belongs in the cabinet or the senate, not a decisive leadership role.

cvxeryw,0,t1_cvxdoz2,LiveByTheFreePen,"Oh come on. I was talking about what it's used to actually compare. Of course the idea is that both sides end up going in a similar direction. That is the shape a horseshoe makes. 

I was asking to see if there's a comparison between the two sides that isn't just stylistic or superficial. 

Which is exactly what you bring up. Both sides ""control speech,"" apparently because sometimes people criticize your ideas when you try to express them in public. The left does it, because a couple academics will say you shouldn't say certain things. Presumably the right does it. I don't know,  because the AFA boycotts things maybe? Obviously it's the far left and the far right, because lord knows you're the reasonable one in the room. 

I don't even see a concrete idea the two sides are close to sharing. ",0,0,1444686356,1444717356
cvxb6pf,0,t1_cvxarz9,LiveByTheFreePen,"Oh, okay. A really big inconvenience, then. Still does not change anything. Your career ambitions, or whatever it may be, don't even begin to weigh against murder. You'll get no sympathy from me on that. ",0,0,1444681151,1444717356
cvx0k4x,0,t1_cvwza87,LiveByTheFreePen,"It isn't also a big deal. If you consider it to be murder, it is probably more important and more profound than any other political issue in America. Frankly, stopping murder far outweighs the inconvenience of having a child. It's not even a question. ",8,0,1444665532,1444717356
cvx07yl,0,t1_cvwvj02,LiveByTheFreePen,"Right, that's the definition. Can you use it in any way that isn't just comparing the styles of the two sides?",0,0,1444664993,1444717356
cvwunrx,0,t1_cvwtxg9,LiveByTheFreePen,"That's the only way it's ever used. That, and to equate communism  and fascism. Feel free to explain it, though. ",-1,0,1444653969,1444717356
cvwtdft,0,t1_cvwn50s,LiveByTheFreePen,"What are you even talking about? If you actually hear people describe what they mean by the horseshoe, it's typically something like ""both sides think they're right and the other is stupid."" That's what I mean by tone. It's a generic, non-descriptive, and useless way to approach politics that exists to let people who think they're in the middle feel sophisticated. 

I don't know where you see the government ""policing people's view."" ",-1,0,1444649871,1444717356
