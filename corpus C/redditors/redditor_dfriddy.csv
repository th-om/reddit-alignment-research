It is simply unsustainable.  So we have two options, distribute wealth in a way that rises all boats, or we can allow the gap to widen further.  And they will play on people's tribal and animalistic fears of the other, so that this becomes our future.

cvsglwe,0,t1_cvse5nt,dfriddy,"Thank you for your clearly well thought out and researched response. 

You spend a lot of time on the impact to teenage workers. I do support a lower teenage rate for these exact reasons. I think a lot of folks who support raising the minimum wage also agree with there being a lower rate for teens in order to keep the barrier of entry low for these unskilled young workers.

Another argument against what you said is that only a small amount of people would be displaced by an increase in the minimum wage (of course, this is only assuming a slight increase, say to $10/hr.) It is fairly unprecedented to have a federal jump like many in the US are asking for to $15.  I have heard ~1% of those current minimum wage earners would be displaced. If that is the cost to increase the quality of life for the other 99% of minimum wage earners, then I think that is worth it.

Good discussion, thanks for the research.

Taxes in some places would have to raise to deal with straight cash transfers to everyone, but would it come from the payroll tax on employers? Not so sure about that.               


I hear people say this a lot about the minimum wage and I am not so sure you are right. Let's first look at employment, sure this would push employers towards more automation and less people (but that is happening anyway) and you can only get so much productivity out of  a worker. I would venture a guess that they are already trying to get as much as possible, despite the lower wage floor than an increase.  Second, prices. Sure, maybe a very small percentage of items are the correct price for both production and demand, but again, I would venture a guess that most of the industries where minimum wage jobs are prominent (food service mostly), the price is well above the cost of production, so an increase wouldn't the price. Instead price is based on where the market dictates, so instead of taking it out on employees or prices, the employer takes the hit.

What do you think? ",1,0,1444277835,1444721069
cvrcxs0,0,t1_cvqsz45,dfriddy,"Yep, I understand that, but wouldn't I still work to get up to 30k?

12k is not doing fine.

So maybe I work a bit less, say 60% less because the 12k allows for it. And so does my 2 other coworkers. Then my employer hires more, but with the same overall payroll. Which helps to decrease unemployment. Seems all good to me.",1,0,1444232334,1444721069
