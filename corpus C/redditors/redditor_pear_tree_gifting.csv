Everyone had a rise when it was discovered that they were not in fact mitt Romney and a fall when it was discovered they couldn't remember three things/were accused of sexual harassment/were actually googled. This year is different because there id's much less of a seemingly inevitable establishment candidate. Bush has establishment backing but not the same level that Romney did.

 Fundamentally trump is nothing like the others in terms of what can damage him. He seriously seems to be politically immortal. He might not get the nomination, but tonight's debate will still be a great show.",4,0,1442431676,1444725311
