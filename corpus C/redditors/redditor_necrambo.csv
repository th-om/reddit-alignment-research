Religious fundamentalists are some of the most bigoted intolerant fucks on the face of the earth. They transcend religion with their dogmatic bullshit, be it Jew Muslim or Christian (or Buddhist or Hindu or wtfever.)

Fundamentalists should be given no quarter lest they start demanding control over how you live your life (and possibly end it if you disagree loudly enough.) ",8,0,1443958435,1444720027
cvmq0hi,0,t1_cvmga1u,necrambo,"There's no easy solution, as weapons are tools used by their weilder. 

These mass murders are a sign of a sick morally bankrupt society. We gorge ourselves on materialism and fast food culture and collectively don't seem to give a shit about human life or dignity. Our entire economic system is built on degradation and exploitation of other people. 

And then something like this happens and we sit and wring our hands and ask ourselves how something like this could possibly happen... ",0,0,1443880641,1444720027

I think you're right when you focus on the fact that our culture is sick. These mass murders won't stop until we get our house in order. ",2,0,1443880179,1444720027

These shootings are so random how the hell can people feel terrorized by them? I'm more worried about feds kicking in my door for my poor choice of vices or getting killed by a distracted driver. 

The absolute last thing I worry about is getting shot by some random nut job. Why does it seem Americans are so bad at risk assessment? ",9,0,1443790636,1444720027

Well sir, gravity is also a theory, where are all the fundies at that should be questioning this ""theory?"" 

Further proof gravity is a liberal plot to sell antigravity credits so their friends can make money! ",0,0,1443555069,1444720027

The tricky thing about authoritarian/libertarian is that it transcends the economic philosophy divide (left vs right.) ",1,0,1443554950,1444720027
