That is a huge factor against safety margins built in for visibility and reaction times on public roads. Maybe the car car driver was too inattentive though. ",6,0,1444684501,1444719399
cvxaooy,0,t1_cvx2w7b,secondsbest,"Can I be pissed about the tax code and be pissed at the corporations for lobbying and using the loopholes that benefit them too? Look at the think tank Tax Foundation, who has most recently advised Rubio and Paul on their fiscal policy platforms, and see that it's run by corporate tax executives and former politicians. Of course, they advise big revenue cuts and to 'help global business' grow the economy. This is despite the fact the CBO has already said that revenue cuts would not generate gains in this economy because big business isn't hurting for cash. ",2,0,1444680455,1444719399

Oddly, if it is a driver crash, the OS has no record in the driver details or message center. This only happens 1 out of 10 times though. Usually, everything just freezes and I have to hit reset. No alt-tab, alt-f4, or ctrl-alt-del commands work. ",1,0,1444614361,1444719399
cvwe909,0,t1_cvwduvb,secondsbest,"Same experience. It was a day or two before 3.4 when an occasional crash turned into a constant struggle, but I wasn't sure that meant anything because I've only been on Rift for a few weeks. I thought maybe there was a hot fix cache issue, so I did a full uninstall, deleted everything related I could find off my drive, and I'm in the process of reinstall and updating now to see if that helps. I really want to play this game though, at least through FO4 release. ",1,0,1444609488,1444719399
