cvvnyqt,0,t1_cvvkhb8,Saffuran,"It all depends on how the money was written out because contract money is usually divided into any number of 4 different categories:


- Signing Bonus [immediate money once you have signed for a team]
- Guaranteed Salary [Salary by year, may scale the farther into the contract it gets or be front loaded to pay out most of the guaranteed contract early on, the remaining balance on money even in future seasons here must be paid upon termination]
- Unguaranteed Salary [Similar to the above and contracts can have portions of guaranteed and guaranteed salary at the same time, this amount does not have to be paid past the point of termination, this portion of cash is usually back loaded onto contracts so that if an organization DOES terminate a contract, the bulk of the money is saved]
- Incentives [Some contracts include incentive bonuses for preformance which can be set all at the beginning of a contract or before the start of each season. Merits would include individual statistics for League that apply are season total kills, KDA, GPM (or CS), Gold Earned per game ~ And bonuses could be tied to team accolades as well Wins/Playoffs/Finals/World Championship appearance e.t.c.]

Lustboy's contract could be fully guaranteed, it could be completely unguaranteed, it could be heavilly incentive based, we don't know what type of signing bonus he had, if any. It's possible that TSM has already paid out 50% of his total contract, more likely they have done somewhere between 30% and 25% but we don't know the structure so we have no way to know for sure. The only thing I know is that contracts are generally organization friendly first, player friendly second.. so TSM likely has a lot of his contract un-guaranteed and back loaded [making the numbers look nice for Lustboy with a fat signing bonus and incentive milestones] and can opt out at any time.",1,0,1444554738,1444721864
cvvh2in,0,t1_cvutvby,Saffuran,"The point of the map pressure is to actually use it to pressure OTHER lanes, therefore drawing them away from the empowered lane, allowing it to push more freely and quickly into their base, which draws opponents back into their base, which allows you to push said other lane in and take towers/inhibs. It is the safe methodical ""map pressure to win"" gameplan. It doesn't work in SoloQ because people don't know that beyond 20 minutes there are lanes other than mid to shove.",0,0,1444534444,1444721864
cvvgp7z,0,t1_cvvfkzw,Saffuran,"Yes they can, organizations can always terminate contracts, they take a monetary hit to a degree depending on the stipultions of said contract but they can cancel it at any time.

Think of NBA, MLB, or NFL players... There are times all the time when a player could be signed for 3-4 years based on a big season or the hope that being on a specific team turns their play around, if they play bad and underpreform their contract, ALL the time players will be cut with time remaining on their contracts. Lustboy signed a contract with TEAM SOLO MID, not with Riot, Riot has no control over the roster choices TSM makes other than imposing an import cap. TSM could drop Lustboy tomorrow just like they dropped a player like Gleeb mid contract.

The paperwork is only binding for the player, the org can opt out at any time they want and move on.",4,0,1444533710,1444721864
cvvglyb,0,t1_cvvg0c7,Saffuran,"People say Quas is quiet when the whole team regards Quas as their captain. Being quiet doesn't mean you say nothing it just means you have a more reserved personality. Also I would say that Quas is fine on tank/supporty tops, I wish that TL wouldn't relegate him to picks like Nautilus though.

Lustboy right now is mechanically worse than Adrian and does not have good english and is known to be a poor communicator in game. Adrian was one of the, if not the main in game shot caller for TIP and was the guy setting up their fantastic vision control that put that team ahead of every other NA team in vision/knowledge of developments within the game. Lustboy's vision control has been (excuse me in advance) COMPLETE ASS, which is a huge reason why Santorin can't make plays and why TSM stalls out so hard. They have no vision which translates into having no knowledge, which means you can't make aggressive plays with odds on your side, be it objective pushes or skirmishes.

Beyond that Adrian is also a rookie year player while Lustboy is a big name veteran who looks like he's out of gas, and holding onto him would be very CJ Entus of TSM... And any good TSM fan does not want this team to be the NA version of CJ stalling out with legacy players.

As a rule you DO NOT want your main playmaker to also be your shotcaller as it hinders their ability to focus on the micro game and it is too easy to tunnel as a carry and pick bad fights. Even Faker isn't his own shot caller, and that is telling enough. Bjergsen is the shotcaller for TSM right now because he's the only real option, ideally Santorin or the support would take up the shotcalling role, but Santorin feels more like a ""puppet"" player (like Bengi, given orders to carry out, but Santorin is no longer given proper orders so nothing happens) so he doesn't fit the role. You need a shotcalling support with a mind for the game because we have seen Bjergsen's shotcalling for over a year now, it's not dynamic, it hinders his play, and is never going to get much better than it is right now, and TSM's macro level play is not good, which translates to Bjergsen not being a good shotcaller.",1,0,1444533529,1444721864
cvvfn4p,0,t1_cvverqt,Saffuran,"Lustboy can delcare NA as his main region which would mean that he wouldn't count towards TSMs cap, that being said, TSM should drop Lustboy if they want to win, he's playing awful now and can't communicate with his team and you don't want a team of korean's that alienate Bjergsen by speaking their own native language around him when he is the one that TSM places their bets on.",3,0,1444531652,1444721864
cvvfkol,0,t1_cvvcph5,Saffuran,"TSM should drop Lustboy, he has deteriorated into garbage. When people were commenting on him being the new Madlife after his Thresh game vs LGD I was like ""yea... he's the new NEW Madlife that feeds his ass off and plays bad and forgot where he left his mechanics."" The support, a huge shotcalling and initiation/counter initiation role, NEEDS to be able to communicate with the team. It's enough that Lust is playing like crap now, but his communication is still crappy.",1,0,1444531519,1444721864
