And, you are the one trying to weasel out of your original position about down-shifting to slow the bike. I'm still waiting for any link, you claimed 100% of riding courses back you up about using the engine instead of the brakes, where is it? Your a noob and you got caught like all the rest of the tools who use down-shifting to slow your bike. It's your engine, fuck it up however you like, you're just a moron for doing it.",1,0,1444259552,1444724307
