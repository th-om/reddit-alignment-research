No it does not; none of the caliphates, starting with Rashidun downwards, wrote any apocalyptic prophecy. In fact, to do so would constitute as blasphemy.

> ISIS wants Iran's nuclear facilities to make nukes.

You can't ""make nukes"" with Iran's current facilities; if that is actually possible, the UNSC wouldn't be talking to Iran right now. And even if they can get enough weapons-grade uranium (they haven't) and assemble a nuclear device (they can't), they still have to overcome the problem of having enough of said device (just one, ten or even a hundred won't cut it) and delivering said device to their targets.

>Mohammed's enemies get destroyed by nukes. 

Not unless they - whoever they are - all obediently congregate in one small, enclosed space and not move from there for any reason.

>The Caliphate fulfills Mohammed's prophecy

Such prophecy does not exist.

>and ushers in ""The End of Times"".

Muslims don't believe that they can ""trigger"" the Apocalypse the same way Dominionists think they can with the red heifer.",2,0,1444688750,1444720724
