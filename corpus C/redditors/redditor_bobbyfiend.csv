cvxqto6,1,t3_3ohltd,bobbyfiend,"In response to a few comments from women (and men) in this thread about the indignity of wearing a ring one doesn't like for decades on end:

Women don't have to wear engagement or wedding rings. I won't deny that there are cultural pressures and social norms, and family pressures, and often fiancee pressures--and those can all be intense--but nobody *has* to wear a ring at all, let alone a certain kind (or cost) of ring, at least in the middle-class dominant-culture slice of America I inhabit. I know married couples who have no rings; they're fine. I know people whose rings are made out of material as cheap as tin and gravel; they're happy. And I know people with rings that cost thousands, and every conversation about the ring starts with a comment about how it wasn't what they really wanted. It's a story that will get told hundreds or thousands of times, as a not-so-subtle signal that their partner (who is almost always within earshot) let them down once and they'll never be able to let that disappointment go. Every time I hear one of these stories (if you pay attention, they're everywhere) I want to leave the room. As far as I can tell, so do most other people nearby.

I find it disingenuous when people imply that it's their fiancees' or spouses' fault that they are unsatisfied with some aspect of their wedding or marriage that is/was clearly important to them, when nothing was stopping those people from having the pre-engagement conversation telling their future spouses (a) their preferences, or--more fundamentally--(b) that those preferences were important enough to them to become a lifelong problem in their relationship. If something is that important, then both partners should be aware of that fact, so it can be added to the ""cost-benefit"" list for the marriage decision. If it's important enough to hold against your spouse for life, then it's important enough to ruin the magic of the engagement or marriage by discussing it. Of course I'm talking about rings, but this applies to other strong preferences that people might not share with the ones who need to know it most, such as a future husband failing to tell his fiancee that he really wasn't planning to pursue that Master's degree after all and he really was going to try to become a professional gamer instead, or that he can't stand to be around his wife's family so she shouldn't count on him ever wanting to get a job near them. 

So, if something is important enough that you're going to complain about it for the rest of your life, then have the hard conversation and tell your future spouse that it's *that damn important*. S/he'll understand or not. And you'll factor that into the decision about whether to get married. *This conversation very well might ruin the magic* (e.g., of the engagement situation). But that magic is overrated. Know what's not overrated? A lifetime without the relationship equivalent of a splinter stuck under one fingernail.

It's hard to have the insight to know your own mind. It's somewhat easier, I think, to try to find someone else's preferences out, as long as they'll share them. So if you're planning to pop any questions, first make well and truly sure that you know exactly what kind of ring your future spouse wants, and *how important it is to her/him that it be that exact thing*. Surprise is for the movies. Two situations in which you should never proceed unless you know the outcome before you start: (1) dissertation defense and (2) marriage proposal. And that includes the ring.

Personally, one wonderful characteristic of my partner (when she was only ""future partner"" many years ago) was that she really did not need an expensive ring to feel happy about our engagement or marriage. It took me years to realize that she was absolutely serious about this. Instead of an expensive ring we had the honeymoon we wanted and made our rent worry-free for several months.

cvxka1s,1,t3_3oggc0,bobbyfiend,"In a slightly different sense it's called *inoculation.* It's used this way when you want to prevent someone being swayed by an argument made in its full force, so you present the argument ahead of time, framed in a way likely to make it easy to reject later. Example: Telling your friend that some people will try to convince her that recycling is inefficient, giving her the evidence they will probably use, and then also giving her enough information to counter those arguments.",2,0,1444695210,1444731922

cvwdk44,0,t1_cvvl2l0,bobbyfiend,"OP should think really, really hard about #2. There are exceptions, but in general these programs are very expensive, with almost no way to defray costs while you're there (no teaching or research assistantships, nearly impossible to survive in grad school with an off-campus job), and you're not going to make $100K per year after you graduate.

The handful of Psy.D. graduates I've known well enough to learn their financial status all had $200K-$300K in debt from their doctoral programs. And they were making perhaps $50K per year in their jobs.

If you get a program like that, the best option, I think, is the federal debt forgiveness program for medically underserved areas. A supervisor of mine worked for about 5 years in ""The sticks"" in rural Indiana, and paid almost all of her $250K off in that time.  She also became the director of the tiny clinic where she worked. But that program is also worth looking at very carefully; it's not for everyone, and it doesn't always work out. Then you have a quarter-million dollars in debt for a degree that gets you a middle-class income at best.",1,0,1444608142,1444731922

In my experience, the 10-item scale never *quite* lived up to the results from that article (though it's really good for such a short scale). The 44-item scale gives you higher reliability and probably better correlations with whatever you're trying to investigate.
