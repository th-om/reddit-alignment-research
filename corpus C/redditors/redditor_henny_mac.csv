That would seem to require some hard-coded information being passed down through generations, genetically.",1,0,1444458474,1444722792
cvukvwy,0,t1_cvu5vvy,henny_mac,"So, do we have any idea HOW insects pass such information down through genetics?

Like, if we 'decrypted' Monarch Butterfly DNA, would we find a map of their route?

Second, pardon my noobness, but did the Dragonriders have particularly strong control over the magical forces of Grrth? Is there any evidence they had control over non-'fire' magical forces as well? Since the Dragonriders didn't believe in gods, did they believe the 'words themselves' somehow invoked the magical forces? 

Finally, I could see an alternate version of this theory where flame visions are just part of 'fire magic.' Either the Valyrians included it in their kit to 'prove' that R'Hollor  exists. Or the religion started because someone from within the walls learned pieces of the magic, and then used it to start a religion with him as the head.

For 'slow zombie' universes, one of the questions is how in the world does the military fail at containing it?

Now, this episodes offered a part of a plausible explanation. The military takes what it views are necessary steps- like segregating 'at risk' into camps. But they do so in a tactless, heartless manner that turns the populace against them.

It's one thing to be fighting zombies. It's another to do while suffering guerrilla attacks from  your countrymen.",8,0,1444019536,1444722792
