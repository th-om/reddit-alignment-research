cvs0urk,1,t3_3nwyls,AntiStrange,">Program Description
In 1948, a British pilot serving in Iraq acquired a clay tablet with an intriguing, 3,700 year-old inscription. The ancient writing tells the story of how the god Enki warns a Sumerian king named Atra-Hasis of a future flood that will destroy mankind; Enki gives him instructions for building a boat to save his family and livestock. If that sounds like a familiar tale, it’s because this was one of several ancient flood traditions that, centuries later, would inspire the biblical story of Noah. But the tablet’s inscription describes a boat very different from the traditional image of the Ark—it’s said to be circular and made of reeds. Is this nothing more than a fanciful myth? Or could such a reed boat have carried Atra-Hasis’ family of more than one hundred and his many animals? Join NOVA as a team of historians and expert boat builders investigates this fascinating flood legend and sets out to rebuild a tantalizing, ancient forerunner of the Ark.

The title of the episode is a bit unfortunate as I see these terrible ""Secrets of.."" pseudo-documentaries on netflix all the time.

Looks like this is an exploration of myths that may have influenced the Noah's Ark story. I don't believe it's trying to convince anyone it really happened.

I think it's a bit hasty to call NOVA dead because you jumped to conclusions about a somewhat unfortunate episode title.

Rest assured, there's still amazingly good content coming out of NOVA.",7,0,1444269045,1444727167

cv6d510,0,t1_cv64twa,AntiStrange,"I'm a little confused about why you think ""It should [only] support rural HEALTHCARE clinics (ie no other practices with > 50 patients within 15 miles) not mega organizations with only one issue.""

Are you saying that that was the original intent of Title X? Or that you think it's intent should be modified?

Title X was introduced as ""Population Research and Voluntary Family Planning Programs"". It was designed to help low-income and uninsured individuals who might not have access to family planning health care services otherwise. And to promote positive birth/family outcomes. 

What does the size of recipient organizations have to do with fulfilling the law's intent of helping low-income/uninsured individuals? It seems to me that limiting Title X funds to smaller organizations would actually go against the original intent by making it harder for some low-income and uninsured individuals.

I would agree that perhaps there is room for it to be updated to take the ACA into account. But, unfortunately, even with the ACA there remains a large segment of the population uninsured. Title X helps those people.",3,0,1442614685,1444727167
