cvdwtjf,0,t1_cvd9te9,BobSmash,"> it would be better to take a child away from its mother in favor of sticking it with a parent who has no time for it, and fobs it off on a nanny

Yes, actually. A nanny is more likely to receive some kind of actual training in childcare and early childhood development. The working parent is more statistically likely to be a productive member of society overall, and may not ""fob the kid off."" (Because let's be honest, wealth isn't an indicator of time spent with your kids, unless you're an 80hr a week type) And in this example, the non-working parent is going to need a job to **pay their own bills.** They may not have free time anyway.

>It's terrible that a child should get something only if it sticks with the rich parent.

I don't know if you've experienced divorce before, but this happens anyway, child support or not. A wealthy parent will always be better off compared to a non-working parent, especially if that parent lacks any career training. They will always be able to bribe the child regardless of where the child lives. Even if the non-working parent receives significant sums of child support money, they will still have to ask for help to make decisions like paying a tutor, or enrolling in sports programs, and shouldn't have the right to spend the earning parent's funds without asking anyway. That's one reason it seems more efficient to me. And if I'm being honest, more fair. In the example provided above, it's not the mother or the child's money. The father earned that money, and should be involved in how it's spent. Why bother with a middleman? Especially if that middleman is incentivized to defy the person earning the money, and may not have free time anyway? I won't comment on child inheritance rights, that system is broken in it's own special ways.",1,0,1443199845,1444722027
cvcwd83,0,t1_cvclbfm,BobSmash,"> Would you say a child would be better off with someone who spends most of their time at the office, or someone who knows how to tend to their needs?

Any child is better off with dedicated attention. It's one of the proposed reasons children tend to do better in two parent families. Having said that, dedicated income, especially high income, gives a working parent so many more options. That child could still see both parents, have dedicated caregivers 24/7, specialized education, etc. And it would be cheaper to provide than the overhead of ""hand non-working parent alimony, hand non-working parent child support, check in with court to make sure they aren't suing me for more because I got a raise, rinse, repeat.""

I'm hard pressed to see a reason why the child is inherently better off with a non-working parent than an extremely well to do working one. Both parents are poised to ensure the child's care, and should share caring duties anyway. It just makes more sense to me for the child to live with the rich parent and reap the benefits.",1,0,1443122469,1444722027
