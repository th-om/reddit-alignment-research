cv4ddoh,0,t1_cv4bqbk,20934812148919031,">If you believe that transition improves their quality of life then it is only logical that suicide rates will go down. 

Yes, and they're still well above normal people, which is the point. If you want to say ""transition helps for a lot of transsexuals but they still have a much higher rate of suicide than others"", I'll agree with you. We can then have a discussion about whether or not it's practical to reduce transphobia to essentially nothing for trans people to *still* have a much higher than average suicide rate.

>Your argument is that self reports have absolutely no value anywhere in the field of science? Why do researchers still use this study method? What you said is utter pseudoscience. 

No, the I'm saying that self reported studies are only indicative of how people will respond to certain questions when queried. Most people significantly underreport caloric intake when diet is studied, and we know what sort of junk conclusions that leads to.

>No, the proposed solution is to allow access to medical transition which reduces the rate of seriously considering suicide by half, then giving them high levels of social support would reduce suicide ideation by 49%, then giving them proper identity documents removes 90 cases out of 1000 of suicide ideation, and then having them experience low levels of transphobia which reduces suicide ideation by 66%. That is the entire plan you can gather from this study which suggests suicide can be reduced to levels similar to the rest of the population.

So change essentially all of human nature; understood. That's about as likely as people having no problem with a severely autistic child having outbursts in a restaurant.

>You read through all of the research I provided on how transgender children are handled by doctors and psychologists? What about it is immoral? 

Letting a 16 year old child make a permanent, life altering decision at a stage when brain capability is underdeveloped is immoral. It's the same reason why we don't have the same criminal punishments for 16 year olds that we do for adults.

>On top of all the evidence I provided you, which included 11 different studies, there is also the opinion of every single medical, psychological, and scientific organization that studies transgenderism. Every single major scientific organization that studies transgenderism all agree that current medical treatments of transgender people greatly benefit them.

It isn't a matter of whether or not it benefits them, it's a matter of whether or not it's the best solution. Your argument is that the best solution is to expect the vast majority of people to change their opinions and act in a manner that is almost the exact opposite to how humanity has acted for the past 250,000 years, so that a specific treatment of a mental disorder will have better efficacy. This will never happen in the communities in which the majority of people live.

Let's put it this way: if there was a pill that one could take that would completely cure a person with GID and make them identify as the gender that corresponds to their sex, bringing their suicide rates and all other negative things associated with transsexuality in line with that of a normal person, would you say that this is the correct treatment instead of hormonal therapy and cosmetic surgery?",0,0,1442464299,1444728140
cv4cxgx,0,t1_cv4bdrk,20934812148919031,">Yes, I heard of Rome. Specifically, I heard how the struggle with internal unity brought on by religious fanatics lead to the eventual collapse of Eastern Rome under it's own weight, brought on by an empire that tried to control it's citizens religious decisions and an invader who thought they were on a God Given Mission (TM) to bring their cute new belief system to the world. 

Did you miss the point? Rome existed for almost 1000 years. No doubt many, even in the 4th century, had faith it would last forever, in the same way that you have faith that we're at the end of history and from now on the world will only continue to become more progressive.

>Also, how the bigotry, idiocy, and uncompromising attitude of it's rulers in regards to those with a different ethnic background than them lead to the ""invasion"" of the west by Barbarians-who, in fact, were soldiers, invited in with promises of land, who the Emperors had the bright idea of not paying because they were barbarians-and the collapse of the entire civilization.

If you think that a relatively small amount of hicks with under average iqs are just as much of a threat to western values as a very large portion of the Earth's population that hold essentially medieval beliefs, then I don't think any discussion of the subject would prove fruitful as you've already decided on an ideological position.

Which claims specifically? That transsexuals have a substantially higher rate of suicide after surgery? I'm not claiming that there is no ""quality of life"" increase for some transsexuals after surgery.

>Also, in a study of suicide rates for transgender people, they found that those who had access to hormone therapy were 50% less likely to seriously consider suicide.

Sure, let's take a look at this.

>The Trans PULSE respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey collected data from trans people age 16+ in Ontario, Canada, including 380 who reported on suicide outcomes.

>Among trans Ontarians, 35.1 % (95 % CI: 27.6, 42.5) seriously considered, and 11.2 % (95 % CI: 6.0, 16.4) attempted, suicide in the past year. Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal identification documents changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions in suicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries (when needed). Parental support for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation. Lower self-reported transphobia (10th versus 90th percentile) was associated with a 66 % reduction in ideation (RR = 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.67), and an additional 76 % reduction in attempts among those with ideation (RR = 0.24; 95 % CI: 0.07, 0.82). This corresponds to potential prevention of 160 ideations per 1000 trans persons, and 200 attempts per 1,000 with ideation, based on a hypothetical reduction of transphobia from current levels to the 10th percentile. 

It's a fucking self-reported survey of 380 people, in a relatively progressive country, stating that 10% of trans people have attempted suicide in the past year. The proposed solution is to essentially eliminate all transphobia, which only reduces suicidal thoughts by 66%. Compare this to the general population, of which 0.6% attempted suicide in the past year.

>Also doctors and psychologists know that the vast majority of children don't have their dysphoria persist into adulthood. However they don't do anything medically to the child until he or she reaches puberty and they don't do anything that can't be easily undone until the age of 16.

Yes, I completely understand this, and I think it's entirely immoral.",0,0,1442449860,1444728140
