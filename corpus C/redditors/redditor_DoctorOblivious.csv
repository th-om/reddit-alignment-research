cvv4rcq,0,t1_cvv4k8j,DoctorOblivious,"I've never been a huge fan of Battlefront, but I played BF2 a little bit.  Everything that I say should be taken with a grain of salt as a result.

I couldn't help but think of the maps in BF2 while I was watching that stream.  Geonosis is still pretty big today and could easily accomodate vehicular combat.

And as for Hoth... well, the N64 versions of Hoth looked better than this one.  An extreme statement, but I'm not exaggerating; I'd rather play the Hoth levels in Shadows of the Empire or the first Rogue Squadron game.",0,0,1444511131,1444717556
cvv42vo,0,t1_cvuv8fn,DoctorOblivious,"Not just that, but it looks like a total clusterfuck, and I'm not sure if it was by accident or by design.  The streamers that I've watched were getting killed almost randomly because an opponent came at them from a blind spot.  Combined with the rather short time-to-kill and the fact that one of the classes has a jetpack.... well, it's a complete mess and it looks like it would get dull after 10-15 minutes.",17,0,1444509891,1444717556
cvv3yax,0,t1_cvv3dws,DoctorOblivious,"I'll admit it, comparing PS2 and BF is definitely not a fair comparison.  They might as well be different genres of games, considering the ludicrous scale in PS2 and the arena-based approach in BF.",2,0,1444509658,1444717556
cvv36tc,0,t1_cvv2j4b,DoctorOblivious,"Ironically, the streamer that I've been watching play Battlefront (ZoranTheBear) used to be into Planetside 2.  I realize that I'm comparing apples and oranges, but I have no idea why he's says he's been enjoying the demo of Battlefront so much.  The game is just looks dull--the weapons are dull, the vehicles are dull, the arenas are dull like nothing I've ever seen, the classes are dull.",5,0,1444508258,1444717556
cvtcn7z,0,t1_cvt66cr,DoctorOblivious,"Both of The Godfather movies are fantastic.  I won't begrudge anyone for preferring one over the other.  Personally, I like the second more than the first, but that's more for the juxtaposition of the grace of Vito Corleone (even if he was quite content to get his hands dirty) with the brutality of his son.",1,0,1444362741,1444717556
cvtck3i,0,t1_cvt9pg2,DoctorOblivious,I'm not embarrassed to admit that I cried during that movie multiple times.,3,0,1444362570,1444717556
cvpreis,1,t3_3nlr47,DoctorOblivious,"I find the concept of trying to curb gun violence through legislation on legal carry laws and the ban on assault weapons to be absurd, IMHO.  Unless she proposes literally confiscating people's legally-purchased weapons, the number of weapons in civilian ownership is going to take decades to diminish.  I'm not a gun owner and I don't know a thing about firearm maintenance, but I'm under the impression that most firearms, properly maintained, are quite durable and can remain operational for decades unless deliberately disabled--her example of carrying an AK-47 through a supermarket is especially absurd due to the almost-memetic durability of that weapon.",7,0,1444104497,1444717556
cvcmhho,0,t1_cvcgncf,DoctorOblivious,"Ooh, pass the peroxide.  I just cut myself on that edge.",12,0,1443108031,1444717556
cv8eoee,0,t1_cv8dwf8,DoctorOblivious,"Yeah.... regrettably, logic and critical reasoning were never the strong suit of people believing in the Birther conspiracy theory.

I just hope that this nonsense doesn't carry over to the next presidency, regardless of who wins.  I feel that the abuse of the filibuster during the Obama administration came about partly as retaliation for its (a)buse against Dubya, and... well, we've watched Congress for the last eight years.",7,0,1442789860,1444717556
