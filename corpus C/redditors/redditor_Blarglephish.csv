Right now, I have a shot on my bench for a QB. Based on projected value, my best 3 options are Stafford, Flacco, and Hasselbeck. I have Kaep on my bench, but honestly I don't trust him.

Probably, but this is just a guess. After all, Donald Trump was someone we all thought was having one of these cycles the first time he said something outrageous (I think it was the John McCain,  ""I like heroes, not prisoners"" statement), and he has actually defied the statistical model of the cycle. His numbers have dropped, but not to the degree that matches this fairly normal model.

AFAIK, Carson doesn't appear to have any congressional endorsements; his fund-raising capabilities are far outmatched by candidates like Jeb and Rubio. Money and friends aren't everything, but they are the best predictors of political success. Right now, Carson doesn't have either. He may be at the beginning of a sharp decline on one of these cycles. Because of this, I wouldn't be surprised that he is the next to drop out (even above other candidates that are barely giving a pulse in polling, like Jindal or Graham), given his dire predicaments. 

He might still be a viable VP candidate for one of the more establishment GOP types, as his base of support is strongest amongst evangelicals.",1,0,1444335001,1444718100
cvro2va,1,t3_3numox,Blarglephish,"You're describing what Nate Silver calls the ""discovery-scrutiny-decline"" cycle, seen in the past few political elections by candidates like Perry, Cain, and Gingrich: bursts of attention that coincide with spikes in the polls but then fade or even burst after several weeks.

Usually, that scrutiny begins to happen after a potentially big gaffe, like the kind here. Even though Carson has been surging in the polls, I'm not convinced that this isn't another one of these cycles we're seeing, and I would expect his polling numbers to drop eventually. Whether that is now or later remains to be seen, but I don't see how Carson survives something like this.",2,0,1444248485,1444718100
