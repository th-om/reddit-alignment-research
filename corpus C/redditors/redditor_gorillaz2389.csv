I read a story about a Koch election group spreading lies about a small town democrat. the Republican opponent actually said on camera that he was embarrassed by it - he never asked this Koch group to help him.

I talked to a guy who did CAD furniture design. Maybe look at CAD operator jobs, in addition to mechanical engineer jobs. 

Judging from my job hunt experience, you won't find what you're looking for with mechanical engineering jobs. My strongest advice is, don't get hung up on that. There is a massive amount of disillusion going from school to the real world. If you only look for something 'creative', you will miss all the best opportunities. ",4,0,1443571921,1444718686
