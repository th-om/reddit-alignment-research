cvj1e9v,1,t3_3mxnvd,praxaway,"Hey praxbros and praxgirls,

&nbsp;

Recall my old [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PraxAcceptance/comments/3jx34l/the_textbook_for_my_upcoming_history_of_thought/).

I'm pleased to report that my professor is, in fact, an Austrian! I'd like to share some of his greatest hits from the first few classes. Unfortunately, I have to paraphrase, because I did not record it. I may in the future.

&nbsp;

*On Keynesians and the Fed*

\> ""The great tragedy of the Fed is that they've bought into the Keynesian falsehood that economic growth is caused by increased consumption, not saving. No, short run or long run doesn't matter. The long run is just the summation of short runs -- how could they be different?""

&nbsp;

*On econome-TRICKS*

\> ""Mainstream economists like to think that they can quantify behavior. But then why is there an error term in every statistical model?""

&nbsp;

*On mathemat-ICKS*

\> ""Math is used to protect the weak Keynesian premises that they desperately cling to.""

&nbsp;


*And now some excerpts from his [book](http://www.amazon.com/Classical-Macroeconomics-Variations-Distortions-Routledge-ebook/dp/B000OI0JZ4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1443592853&sr=8-4&keywords=classical+macroeconomics), where he provides undeniable evidence that academic journals are [prejudiced](http://panampost.com/belen-marty/2015/05/08/argentinean-university-austrian-economists-need-not-apply/) against Austrians.*


\> ""Earlier, a referee for a history of economic thought journal who could not appreciate the validity of my argument advised the editor: **Do not publish. Do not encourage re-submission**.""


\> ""The **resistance of the referees** convinced me even more firmly of the need to publicize the extent of Keynes's distortions of classical macroeconomics. So I followed up the first paper with another, entitled: ""Keynes on the Classical Theory of Interest: Hicks's Clarifications could not be Successful."" After several failures to get it published, I transformed it into, 'Keynes, Hicks, and the Inadequacies of the IS-LM Model', which also met with **vigorous resistance from referees**.""

&nbsp;

*Rejections*


\> Referee A: 'This paper falls into two parts. The first part demonstrates that Keynes was very careless in interpreting the classical economists with whom he was quarreling. So what else is new? The second part of the paper speculates about what Keynes might have written if he had taken the trouble to understand the classical economists (and perhaps become one of them?). **I haven't the faintest idea of the criteria to be applied to judging this exercise of counterfactual history**.'

\> Referee B: 'The analysis in Ahiakpor's paper does not add much to familiar themes, nor is it sufficient to warrant drawing attention to what is basically a puzzle. A useful paper in (sic) 1930 perhaps, but not in 1994. **I do not recommend publication in the journal, and would be not enthusiastic about it for any other journal**.'
