cvrc968,1,t3_3nu5ng,Eighty-8,"I would say no, If we wanted to get involved in Syria we should have done so in 2012. Now it is effectively too late. Even if you think the FSA are the 'good guys' in this war they are currently weak compared to both Assad and ISIS^[1](http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/22/world/meast/syria-rebels-lister/) Frontline did a very insightful and unbiased documentary about this issue. It's called [Obama at War](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/obama-at-war/). I highly recommend you watch it. There is another great Frontline documentary about the rise of ISIS which is relevant as well. What I think honestly is best is to let Russia prop up Assad (even though he is a cruel leader who has attacked his own people), rather than have the US weaken Assad only to have ISIS take control of more land.
