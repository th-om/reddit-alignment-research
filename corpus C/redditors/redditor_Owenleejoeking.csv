cvxbet1,0,t1_cvwyzs6,Owenleejoeking,Actually it will be cheaper to take the smaller principle out first- even at the same interest rate because freeing up that minimum payment can then be sent directly to principle on the 7k loan,1,0,1444681470,1444728622

I started my path to PF by reading all the general info on the sidebar. 


If there is one single thing you need to appreciate to ""get"" personal finance its Present Value/compounding interest. Understand how interest in debt/investments can work for and against you. ",1,0,1444615290,1444728622
cvwhak7,0,t1_cvwgw7p,Owenleejoeking,"It has certainly been the most useful from undergrad for me. The only text we used more was Tarek Ahmed's 4th edition Reservoir book. So much content it's crazy. The only thing crazier was the typos.

It's out of print and super freaking valuable now. Jokes on all my classmates that sold theirs lol",1,0,1444615007,1444728622

But that's only if you are investing the saved funds in something that will earn you >4%. 
Paying them off is an instant ~4% ROI for you and it would be pretty awesome to be debt free in a year before you go crazy spending. If you end up needing the money for your parents or something else- you can dial back your payments for the month and save it up pretty quickly if you need. 

I make basically what you do and have a lot more in loans. I'm fighting as fast and hard as possible to get them paid of and off my back so I can enjoy myself worry free and with one less bill each month. 

Also check if the Perkins loan has be accruing interest that is about to be added to principle- like an unsub stafford I'm not familiar with them personally. ",2,0,1444612472,1444728622
