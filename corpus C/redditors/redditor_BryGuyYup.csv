cvpj5e4,1,t3_3nmrm6,BryGuyYup,"I moved here from NJ just about a year and a half ago and I absolutely love it. It's starkly beautiful and interesting to look at in a way that the generic suburbs and deciduous forest of the mid-Atlantic isn't.

It gets hot, for sure, but you get used to it and, you know, air conditioning. After a year here I absolutely *hate* going back to the northeast as it feels cold, wet, and miserable.

As cities go, Tucson feels tiny to me (having lived and worked in and around NYC for much of my life) but it's a metro area of a million people, and the homogenizing influence of TV and the internet means that on some level, it feels like ""everywhere America"". Wal-mart and McDonalds everywhere and such.

The people are great, the mountains are beautiful, and even in a relatively ""small"" city like Tucson you can still get a great falafel or malai kofta. My biggest concern about leaving the NYC area was still having good, cheap Indian restaurants :P

Other than that, there's really no reason to be ""terrified"" about moving out to the Southwest - what exactly is it the scares you about relocating? I've lived, worked, and traveled around to a whole lot of different places in the US and, although each place has its own character and feel, everywhere's sorta the same. Everywhere has Netflix and Starbucks. If you're outgoing, nice, and courteous, people everywhere are nice back.",2,0,1444090364,1444719232

I wasn't intending to make ""doomsday predictions"" but rather suggest that the signs have been worrying. At its worst, it'll still be a great game, at least to me (even Oblivion, the game of theirs I liked the least, I still played for hundreds of hours).",1,0,1443991426,1444719232
cvnz953,1,t3_3ngk7d,BryGuyYup,"Edit to add a tl;dr: as more gets revealed about FO4, it looks more and more like Bethesda is losing sight of their strengths and I worry that will make for a poorer game.

Pretty unlikely anything could ever top Morrowind, since doing something that ambitious, engrossing, cool, and just plain weird would never make it past the VP of marketing at any AAA developer anymore.

Truth be told, as more and more gets revealed about FO4, the more and more worried I get that it'll be a big, shiny, beautiful disappointment.

Let's consider what Bethesda's really best at - what makes a game a Bethesda game, what their strengths are:

1. Amazing modding communities and mod support
2. Player freedom
3. Indirect story-telling

In each of these three cases there have been very troubling signs.

1. Mods

The brief foray into paid mods with Skyrim in the Steam workshop is very, very worrying. Hearing Gabe talk about trying to incentive mod makers through pay is just painful since it ignores really basic notions about human psychology and motivation. Study after study has shown that when someone is doing something they love, they're intrinsically motivated and that paying them to do that exact same thing actually reduces their effort and the quality of their work.

Mods to FO and TES are labors of love and done for fun. That ethos shines through and turning it into a business will dump a giant turd into the punchbowl and I worry a lot about what it will do to the modding community. And, has been said before, bringing mods to consoles could carry a whole lot of baggage with it. I don't know what that baggage may or may not be, but its worrying.

2. Player freedom.

The thing I love about TES/FO is that tabula rasa main character. ""This time I'm going to play as a bosmer hunter who doesn't even know he's the Dragonborn. He gets out of Helgen by the skin of his teeth and spends his days hunting game across Skyrim until eventually he bites off more than he can chew and dies to several rampaging giants.""

""This time I'm a caravan master who was doing side-work as a Courier until some prick in a checkered coat showed up and shot me in the head. I'm just so happy to have survived that there's no shot in hell I'm going to chase after him. Instead, I just do my circuit of the Mojave, trading and scavving until I've built up my personal goal of one million caps and then retire in Goodsprings.""

and so on.

A voice protagonist sounds like it's going down a path that would make this kind of self-story-telling difficult.

3. Indirect story-telling.

Look, Bethesda's games have a long history of having problems with their main story. It's almost always one of the weakest parts of their games. But who cares? That's not what makes them great.

Instead of recognizing that and focusing on their strengths, it sounds like they're trying to turn FO4 into like Last of Us or something. In that panel interview Todd Howard went on about trying to make a really emotionally compelling main story line. Now I'm all for emotionally compelling narrative in games.

I'll never complain about ""cinematic"" games as crappy ""on-rails interactive movies"". I think that's a style of game that can be done well and Naughty Dog certainly shows us that you can create phenomenal player experiences with that.

But that kind of experience just doesn't gel **at all** with the free-roaming Bethesda experience. Narrative relies on pacing, tone, structure - the story has to hit the right beats at the right time. And when your PC can just randomly wander off in the middle, you have to give up on the notion of pacing.

As I see the two single most brilliant bits of storytelling I've ever seen in a Bethesda game were the computer entries you'd find in Honest Hearts (yes I know Obsidian, but they were working in Bethesda's template) - when I finally had everything click with those computer entries and the tribal society/religion it was a moment of pure revelation. It was sad and funny and just plain beautiful.

The other really stand-out bit of brilliance is the plungers climbing up the wall guy in FO3. It's such a weird, stupid, mind-boggling, sad little throwaway visual gag that just invites you to image what the hell was going on in the room, what happened, and what could have created the desperation that lead to what you see when you walk in. It's this amazing piece of indirect storytelling - like a video game equivalent of Hemingway's six word novel.

I'm not really a minecraft fan and the whole build-your-own settlement thing leaves me feeling kind of flat, but I will say this: I'd rather have a Bethesda game with NO main plot at all that just lets you go on side missions and work to build up your little settlements.

Anyway, this got way longer and rant-ier than I'd meant.",2,0,1443981259,1444719232

An hour of nonstop sprinting after little lizards and my two guys are completely tuckered out. That is, until I start eating breakfast at my standing desk. Then this little inattentive stubborn turd suddenly gets very focused:

cvnqpen,1,t3_3ng5lc,BryGuyYup,"I staunchly opposed Obamacare because it is simply the early 90's Republican plan - a giveaway to big insurance businesses. The required medical loss ratios, banning recissions, and preventing denial due to pre-existing conditions are all well and good, but those are barely nibbling at the edges of the problem.

Had they maintained the ""public option"" - basically anyone could buy into Medicare - that would've been a little better, but what we need to do is simply expand Medicare to every single citizen, not just those over 65 and disabled people.

The real problem with Obamacare is that it set back the health debate in this country by a century. We only seem to be able to have a real debate and get real change in health care policy once or twice a century, and now any chance for real, universal public health coverage is shut down until my grandkids are grown up, because the right will scream ""YOU GOT OBAMACARE WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT!!!""",59,0,1443966269,1444719232
