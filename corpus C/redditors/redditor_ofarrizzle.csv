cvxwrgf,0,t1_cvxogvf,ofarrizzle,"How well Hezbollah operates with modern close air support will be interesting to watch. Hezbollah infantry are generally thought to be comparable in quality as regional state militaries, but proper CAS is something they've not done before.",1,1,1444719161,1444728136
cvxva2s,1,t3_3oh7uv,ofarrizzle,"The Iraqi government [announced that Diyala province was cleared back in January](http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2015/01/26/Iraq-forces-liberate-Diyala-province-from-ISIS-officer-.html), and the tactics in this video are closer to IS's insurgency tactics before its summer 2014 offensives than the tactics it uses in conventional battles on the frontlines.  This would indicate that IS can easily revert to a high-intensity insurgency after it loses the conventional fight and the security forces re-enter areas it holds.  This does not bode well for Iraq.",2,0,1444714521,1444728136
cvxsyr5,1,t3_3ogu3b,ofarrizzle,"Pretty awesome that some of it looks shot with infrared film, shown around 1:08.

[An Irish artist named Richard Mosse did a project called ""The Enclave"" using 16mm Aerochrome infrared film, which made for some *really* cool footage and photos.](https://vimeo.com/67115692)  The film was originally developed for the military in order to spot camouflaged positions, as only plants would appear bright pink.  Moses's intention was to similarly bring new light to the long-simmering humanitarian disaster in DR Congo, where the film was shot.",1,0,1444709140,1444728136

cvxrn21,0,t1_cvxr9gk,ofarrizzle,"The general consensus seems to be that rebel-held areas are quite often depopulated.  Given the massive refugee and IDP flows from them, it would seem that people are relatively able to flee them.",1,0,1444706757,1444728136

cvxpifo,0,t1_cvxpfa7,ofarrizzle,"They would be, but the shooters would have to be too close, putting them at risk from the resulting blast.  It might not reach it's target, but getting close enough to hit them with unguided shoulder-fired AT weapons could very well mean the blast could reach them.",1,0,1444703285,1444728136
cvxpget,1,t3_3oim85,ofarrizzle,"It's interesting and rather unique that they described the CIA's program as much larger than the Pentagon's failed T&E effort.  It's completely true, of course, but the CIA's program is rarely mentioned in Western coverage of the US's Syrian policies, let alone described as larger.",13,0,1444703201,1444728136
cvxo5kg,0,t1_cvxnvua,ofarrizzle,"When that same open road is being fought over by one faction or another, none of whom operate with much discretion, your house - surrounded by walls that might stop the bullets - might look better than being exposed in the middle of the countryside.",1,0,1444701166,1444728136
