cvx77ax,1,t3_3o680d,Grundelwald,"I've always followed the band really closely (except for a period during the SIAS era), so during the recording/producing phase I learned of Homme's involvement which led me to listen to a ton of QOTSA which I think prepared me for the Humbug sound. When it came out, I thought it didn't quite top FWN but I did love it from day one. 

I only really had one other friend who was an avid fan of the band, and he liked the album even more than I did. I had some other friends who I had gotten into AM with WPSIATWIN, but they were always only casual fans, and they had already lost interest from FWN.",2,0,1444675443,1444716841

For AM I'd have scratched Snap Out of It and I Want it All. 

Too lazy to do the others. ",1,0,1444406754,1444716841

The one that sticks out the most in my memory is the time that we decided to all turn our desks 90 degrees at a predetermined time and act like it was normal. She was chill about it and ended up just moving to the other side of the room.",3,0,1444286225,1444716841
