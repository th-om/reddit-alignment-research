fair enough.

>A billionaire having a lot of money does not deprive any body of the ability to vote.

i agree. however, if said billionaire chooses to use their money as a campaign contribution, they will have much more influence than you or i. 

>And the Koch brothers supporting candidates does not change the fact that a candidate still must win the support of normal people in order to be elected.

most citizens don't participate politically and the rest are generally apathetic. furthermore, speaking broadly a lot of people don't apply critical thinking to their political beliefs and are instead motivated by social values or media sound bites.

>Now, you could argue that people like the Kochs have more power than they should. But, as evidenced by Bernie's fundraising and polling success, and the failure of Scott Walker, such power is very limited.

the koch's didn't give a penny to walker.

>Given these realities, one can hardly claim that the Koch's run the elections.

no, but they have a very disproportionate influence due to their capital.",1,0,1444588027,1444729759

secondly. your original comment was more of a series of questions that a claim.

finally, the political issue with concentrated wealth is that one billionaire can disenfranchise millions of regular citizens. economic power becomes political power.",1,0,1444507661,1444729759
