You said it wouldn't happen under Israel but let me pose to you a very real possibility of change that can happen. 

The PA is near collapse and it's only a matter of time until the government in Ramallah abdicates. When that happens, what becomes of law and order? Let's say that Israel takes up the burden of policing the rest of the West Bank. What becomes of the Arabs that are not Israeli citizens? Well, they could apply for membership as Israelis. If they do, that will give the Arabs a massive voting bloc that will see the Knesset change from a Jewish only leadership to one that will be challenged by Arab parties. 

That is, if Israel allows these Arabs to apply for citizenship. So let's say they deny them citizenship for fear of what might happen as I mentioned above. What is the Palestinians recourse? Well, I can see protests demanded equal civil rights. And we all know how western countries love civil rights. 

For me, I can honestly see Israel suppressing a Palestinian movement calling for civil rights and the world turning against Israel, much in the same fashion as apartheid Africa. It's honestly this scenario or Israel wipes put all the Palestinians. ",0,0,1444450404,1444726356
