But should we honestly accuse the person mugged of being at fault? I'm not arguing that there aren't variables to every situation but that no matter what the only reason a mugging occurred was because of the mugger. Thus the mugger is the one legally and morally at fault.",-2,0,1444708623,1444722699
cvxsfn6,0,t1_cvxs71i,Omen12,"I guess, in my view, holding ourselves to a ""normal"" is a never ending chase. No ones completely normal and the more we advocate this normal the more harm it does. Look at the 1950's and the impact the nuclear family has had. And you're right, reality sucks. But I don't think we shouldn't try making it a little bit better.

It really is. Committing a negative action against another makes you entirely responsible. Me walking down a street does not make me in any way at fault for a mugging. The only reason the mugging took place was the muggers actions, not mine.",-3,0,1444706879,1444722699

I think it can harm anyone, which is why there are *some* restrictions.

>But he should realize that while it may be physically comfortable, if he finds getting made fun of uncomfortable, maybe he should think twice about it.

He shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable though. There's no reasonable reason why. And when we just accept the treatment at face value we ultimately allow it to continue.

I do enjoy that though. Maybe not specifically investing but financial markets in general.

Yeah, honestly I get it. My most recent posts may make it seem that way lol.
