And there it is. Until you understand that there is a difference between biological sex and gender, the conversation is moot. Granted, it's been moot at long as people (see also: you) decide to be huge assholes about it but that's always been the case with assholes.",-4,0,1444704210,1444720949
cvxpz4r,0,t1_cvxppwv,R3miel7,"Ok, here's some life advice: don't be an asshole. That's literally it. If someone see's themselves a certain way, just be cool. You don't need to find them attractive or even necessarily agree but going along with how they identify is just a polite and kind thing to do. Just accept people for who they are and don't be a huge dick about it. With this advice, you will be able to navigate any social situation without coming off as an ignorant, bigoted asshole. Good luck.",-5,0,1444704012,1444720949
