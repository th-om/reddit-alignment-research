In fact it is difficult to find a plausible mechanism by which current GM crops could be harmful.

I suspect that you have your settings set to hide posts with less than -4 votes and you assumed that there was some censorship.  

If you think you have a legitimate point of view you should bring facts and evidence to science subs and not run to advice animals and spread conspiracy theories about censorship.",3,0,1444688801,1444726018

That is incoherent.  Farming is a business, farmers are free to choose what they plant and the overwhelmingly (in certain crops) choose to plant GM.  If they are not interested in having a viable business, they wouldn't be farmers.

Go to an agriculture sub and ask them yourself/

2.  The decades old scientific consensus is that there is no difference in health or safety between GM and non-GM crops.  http://i.imgur.com/Dj0MLX1.jpg

3.  'Non-GMO' and 'USDA Organic' labels already exist.  

4.  There is no compelling reason to mandate a 'life-style label'.  Consider religious groups mandating all non-halal or non-kosher foods be labeled instead of the other way around.

5.  Given there is no compelling scientific reason for a mandatory label, such laws run afoul (ironically) of free speech.  This is the primary reason the law will be struck down in court.  

6.  Labeling laws (as stated so far) would cause serious logistical issues, because it would require completely separate handling and storage of different varietals, a chain of custody would be required from farmer to processing plant.  A state passing such a law would be in effect legislating across state boundaries and be struck down under the commerce clause.  This is a secondary reason the law it will be struck down in court.

7.  Adding to the expense of food with no compelling reason is dumb.

8.  There is no well defined definition of what constitutes a GMO.  Everything from artificial selection to transgentics are genetically modified in one sense and only activists seem to confuse Genetically Engineered with Genetically modified.  This is another reason the law will be struck down in court.

9.  Most GM crops are animal feed or are processed to the point that there is nothing ""GM"" about the product.  Maybe you can point to the ""GM"" part of a sugar molecule.  How can such a thing be meaningfully labeled or enforced?  This is another reason the law will be struck down in court.
