And the historical documents, what makes them special? They ultimately come from experience, correct? It falls on the same pitfalls as before. There are many historical documents based on the variety of experiences.

You could throw out the entirety of scientific discovery with this paragraph, not just religious beliefs.

>How can one determine who and why from the giant pile of contradictory sources?

Which contradictory sources?

>Also, historical documents? Where did those originate?

They were written down.

>Science would describe how a deity would not do something, not how it was done.

That would assume that the deity didn't design what you would call ""the natural order of things"". For example, you could say that the process of natural selection disproves God, but that would assume that God didn't design the process of natural selection.",1,0,1444223358,1444731744

FTFY. Truth is truth. Our perception of how ""extreme"" a certain truth is doesn't change that truth.

Think about how you would react to the following statements:

>What people say about ISIS and their horrible actions is so extreme and so against what I feel is right that I don't believe ISIS exists.

.

>What people say about Guns, about how many people they kill each year, is so horrible and so against what I feel is right, that I don't believe guns exist.

People stating this would be dismissed, because their opinion doesn't change truth. In no other area of life is it acceptable to say ""I don't like a stated truth, it therefore isn't truth"". When it comes to God, however, it is somehow totally acceptable to say ""I don't like that truth, it doesn't match with my worldview, therefore it isn't true"", like somehow they believe ""my opinion changes truth"".",1,0,1444144511,1444731744

It may be frowned upon by those who don't want to spend the time looking for answers (which IMHO applies to way to many of the leadership of the church), but it isn't frowned upon by Biblical Christianity. Wisdom, knowledge, and the pursuit of them are all over the Bible:

>1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: 2 for attaining wisdom and discipline; for understanding words of insight; 3 for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life, doing what is right and just and fair; 4 for giving prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young-- 5 let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance-- 6 for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise. 7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline. - Proverbs 1

.

>Warning Against Rejecting Wisdom
20 Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares; 21 at the head of the noisy streets she cries out, in the gateways of the city she makes her speech: 22 ""How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? 23 If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you. 24 But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand, 25 since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke, 26 I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you-- 27 when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. 28 ""Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me. 29 Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD, 30 since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke, 31 they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes. 32 For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them; 33 but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm."" - Psalm 1
