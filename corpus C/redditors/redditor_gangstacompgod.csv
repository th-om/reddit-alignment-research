cvwzrq4,1,t3_3ogl1e,gangstacompgod,"In short, yes. If I say ""Continued inaction on the front of climate policy is just a slippery slope to Earth's temperature rising by 4 degrees celsius, massive flooding, displacement, and unprecedented humanitarian crisis,"" one might choose to depict this as a ""slippery slope,"" in that I go from what appear to be mundane premises to catastrophic conclusions. Someone who found this implausible might consider this a problematic slippery slope, but of course it's a perfectly reasonable chain of causation. So whether something is a slippery slope in an objectionable sense is going to depend on the claim in question, since typically the charge of ""slippery slope"" turns on how realistic the claim is.

cvwzinu,1,t3_3oglx3,gangstacompgod,"Right, so this is actually a common point of misunderstanding when it comes to anti-realism. Relativists, like Gilbert Harman, defend the claim that there are multiple true moralities. The sort of ""classical"" 101 relativism would say that these moralities are determined relative to cultures. But notice: on this picture, there are *actually true moral propositions*, even though they are relative to culture. I can say ""murder is wrong"" and be right, I'm just right for different reasons than the realist would say. 

Error theory, on the other hand, says that judgments like ""Murder is wrong"" are categorically false. Typically when people deny that moral facts exist and then posit that morality is ""relative,"" what they mean is that morality is *merely* people's opinions, which are a result of their culture and upbringing, and hold no more force than that (whereas the relativist would hold, for instance, that these opinions constitute the moral truth).
