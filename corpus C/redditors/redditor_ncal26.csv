Position players aren't very deep in this upcoming class. Besides Heyward....there's not much I want. 

I think we can resign Parra at a reasonable deal. Maybe someone like Samardzija can be had cheap after struggling this past year. Pitchers are deeper than position players. Leake interests me a little.

It just depends on whether Angelos wants to loosen up a little and spend some dough. ",4,0,1444005383,1444722039

Who replaces his production? Christian Walker? Hah okay.

cvivwvv,1,t3_3mvp1m,ncal26,"Climate Change.

Boggles my mind how they legitimately believe humans aren't doing any damage to the Earth and that this isn't a pressing issue. 

At least Rand Paul is smart enough to not side on the Republican side of this one. Also the war on drugs. That's why Paul is my favorite Republican right now. He's a fresh voice for the party we desperately need. Guys like Cruz and Trump I can't take seriously. ",11,0,1443581713,1444722039

Federally funding for PP is insanely high. Why not just cut spending for PP in half and put the rest towards community healthcare centers? ",-31,0,1443480573,1444722039

cusy9nf,0,t1_cusvlzd,ncal26,"Good write up man. Also a Towson alum and can definitely vouch for his skills seeing him run on a daily basis.

There's no doubt he could have gone to a D1 school. But he had a kid at a young age and wanted to stay local.

I hope he gets a chance in Tennessee in my opinion he's a better back than Sankey. ",4,0,1441583863,1444722039

Knew he was going to be good. Actually glad we dealt him because Os can't develop pitchers worth shit.
