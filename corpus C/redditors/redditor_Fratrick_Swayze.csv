cvhtf88,1,t3_3msj3w,Fratrick_Swayze,"1. Going to a liberal university.

In high school and my freshman year of college I was an extremely cringy, outspoken atheist left winger. The area I grew up in was relatively conservative/moderate. When I went to college, and was surrounded by classmates and professors who I agreed with,  I realized how I came off to people.

 I found that the left was not good at explaining or defending their positions, so much as silencing any opposition. All of the things that you see on /r/tumblrinaction *are* actually occurring on campuses throughout America. Trigger warnings, white privilege, socialist professors that propagandize to a captive audience due to mandated liberal arts courses; these things are really quite frightening. The left wing professors seemed to come off as mean spirited and angry.

I had one conservative Christian professor and he was the most amazing dude. Let anyone  who disagreed with him speak up and debate with a kindly smile on his face. Would grade papers  fairly even if they disagreed with his own worldview.

 2 My Middle Eastern fiance.

My fiance is an apostate from Islam who grew up in a conservative Middle Eastern country, who I met while studying abroad. A liberal feminist in her own country, it is amazing to see her reaction to the sort of white liberal identity politics that we have in the West. 

It would be the *death penalty* for her to date me in her country, let alone be an apostate from Islam. Yet she sees white liberals in the west kowtow to Islam, and defend hijab wearing ""Muslim Feminists"". She thinks that the current Muslim immigration to Europe will be a disaster and she has even confronted do-gooder liberals on this.
