A miscarriage (that's natural) isn't anyone's fault. Even someone who believes it's a person at conception isn't going to want to charge someone for a natural death. 

Saying we're suddently going to charge women with manslaughter for miscarriages is like saying you're going to charge people's kids because their parents died of natural causes while they were visiting the kids for the holidays. It's absurd. ",1,1,1444705192,1444721930

The plan for lots of teams now is develop lots of good in house cheap young talent (we're getting that) and supplement with free agents and trades when you're at the point ot put you over the hump. 

We're probably a year away from that at best, wait until all the big names are off, get a smarter big name who's younger and go from there. ",1,0,1444668806,1444721930

It's just simple economics. Imagine you signed a contract to provide healthy snacks to a small business. And then the next day they just planted bunch of fruit trees on the property for employees to use.

Now imagine you had to pay for that. How happy are you?",1,0,1444667365,1444721930

But can you imagine being a network that shelled out the money necessary to get the rights to the World Series only to find half the people watching it used MLB.TV and you got nothing from them?",2,0,1444606670,1444721930
cvvxswq,0,t1_cvvwwfd,PyreDruid,"I hated Sherlock. It's bland characters set up to appeal to a certain demographic and far from what I'd call ""great"". Sherlock himself is just bland, there are other versions of Holmes I prefer, and other British detective shows I find better (like Broadchurch, the first season of that was great).

And I've seen every episode of the new Doctor Who as well as a bunch of the old. The seasons he's done are among my least favorite for a few reasons. The Doctor's are more one dimensional, god *knows* what they're doing with supporting actors. And it's just bland television more often than not. Since he's been doing the showrunning it's just meh.

Edit: Don't assume someone ""just hasn't seen their stuff"" when they have an opinion that disagrees with yours. ",1,0,1444582759,1444721930
