cvx20cs,1,t3_3ogczu,howardcord,"An important step in the evolution of the Abrahamic religions is very visible in the Old Testament. Many verses seem to talk about multiple gods and other gods besides Elohim as actually existing. This step between polytheism, the worship and belief of many gods, and monotheism, the worship and belief in only one God, is [monolatrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolatrism).  A great book on the topic is [The Evolution of God](http://www.amazon.com/The-Evolution-Back-Readers-Pick/dp/031606744X) by Robert Wright. ",4,0,1444667821,1444731060

cvvhw30,0,t1_cvvgaqm,howardcord,"It allows vote brigading, even with non-participant links. It also allows for an environment where posts and comments are openly mocked. Even if we disagree with all aspects of the comment and the poster, there is no reason to link to it simply to mock it and to feel holier than them.  We are better than that. We don't need to laugh at people that disagree with us. ",7,0,1444535978,1444731060
cvvh439,0,t1_cvvgw09,howardcord,"Direct links allowed are either scientific peer reviewed publications or a press release on the journal, as long as it isn't an opinionated blog. All other climate related posts will be regulated to self posts. ",1,0,1444534532,1444731060
cvvgri3,0,t1_cvvfksb,howardcord,"This is admittedly a half measure that is meant to dissuade the posting of specific political motivated climate content, from both sides, where scientific evidence is lacking.  There are two other subreddits that already exist that focus solely on climate, one for climate skeptics exclusively, the other ran by climate skeptics with a broader posting base. The reason this subreddit is used by contrarians and AGW believers alike is the subscriber base is larger.  However, it is the same subscriber base that participates in climate dialogue, so a complete ban wouldn't be fair.  We will try this method to see how the following few weeks go.",1,0,1444533835,1444731060

cvveoaq,0,t1_cvvbkp5,howardcord,"This is not an out right ban, just a direct link ban on unscientific sources. Self posts can still link to any blog or article, denier or antagonist, biased either way.  ",3,0,1444529801,1444731060
cvveafr,0,t1_cvva01l,howardcord,"Blogs and other articles can still be posted in self posts with discussion of politics regulated there. We feel this will limit the number of duplicated posts on a breaking news articles of a politician giving their remarks on the topic.  

We also realize that the back and forth bickering from both sides of the climate debate are unlikely to sway anyone's opinion that regularly post here. The arguments get repetitive and we believe limiting the direct linked posts to meaningful scientific articles will improve the content.  

If anything, this move is a better deal for AGW believers than its contrarians. Since scientific articles rarely agree with deniers it will limit those articles direct posts. 

A direct ban of contrarian articles wouldn't be a fair choice (who judges what counts as a denier site or article?) so the other option would be a complete ban on climate articles all together. We don't want to take that step. ",1,0,1444529072,1444731060

CO2 is a radiative gas that emits LWIR in all directions, including upwards into space....if you increase the atmospheric CO2, you obviously increase upward emissions into space â€“ which are lost forever. This means, ... the planet as a whole is COOLED by increasing atmospheric CO2, not warmed!
