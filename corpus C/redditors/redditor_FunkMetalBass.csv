cvxpu4f,1,t3_3oj6fc,FunkMetalBass,"It sounds silly, but one of the best things you can do for yourself is read the book for your course beyond just the assigned exercises. Authors usually do a pretty decent job of motivating the material and trying to give you some intuition for where it comes from. This intuition should help you internalize the concepts. If you get stuck, there are plenty of great resources (khan academy, MIT OCW, etc).

Another suggested technique is to study more often (even if the amount of time per week is the same). The more you see the material, the longer you'll have to mentally digest it, and this will help solidify it more long-term.",3,0,1444703794,1444718516

cvtnp9i,0,t1_cvtljkb,FunkMetalBass,"Since the triangle formed by the cone's height and radius is a right triangle, you could have applied some trig. (The angle x stays fixed, so r/h = tan(x) for all time.)

Also, it's assumed you've seen similar triangles at this stage in your math career (and your book probably uses it for an example too), so you should be able to freely use it.",1,0,1444397671,1444718516

Inductive hypothesis: Suppose 2k-3≤2^(k-2) for all 1≤k≤n. We want to show that this inequality holds for the case where k=n+1. So

2(n+1)-3 = (2n-3)+2 ≤ 2^(n-2)+2 ≤ 2(2^(n-2)) = 2^(n-1) = 2^(n+1-2)",1,0,1444328726,1444718516
cvsnd5l,1,t3_3nzfir,FunkMetalBass,"By a similar triangles argument, you have that h/3=r at all levels of the water tank.

The height of the cone and the radius of the cone are both functions of time, so

dV/dt = π/3 (r^(2) dh/dt + 2hr dr/dt)

Since r=h/3, dr/dt = (1/3)dh/dt, hence

dV/dt = π/3 (h^(2)/3 dh/dt + (2/9)h^(2) dh/dt) = (5π/27)h^(2) dh/dt.

Now, when h=2m, you are given that dV/dt = 0.05m^(3)/s = 1/20 m^(3)/s, so, if I didn't screw up on any of these calculations,

1/20 = (5π/27)(2)^(2) dh/dt  => dh/dt = 27/(400π) m/s",3,0,1444322920,1444718516
