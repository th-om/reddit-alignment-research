Economists think that free trade is beneficial in principle on a macroeconomic scale, they don't think that every agreement with ""free trade"" in the name is beneficial no matter what.

You're right, bad example.  Canada were definitely on the wrong side of that issue.  But the larger point remains: people will give up different things to get access to different markets.

And the even larger point, is so what?  There hasn't been any pressing argument made for the necessity of the TPP.  We've already heard all the benefits, and there's just not that much tangible to get excited about for the average Canadian.",1,0,1444420866,1444719321
