Why does it need to be a picture ID?  Are you worried about people en masse stealing ID's from registered voters and using them to vote on their behalf?",1,1,1444697746,1444716921

Not particularly, actually it was more of a ""well you did it first!"" than it is a rebuttal of it being partisan or racist.",1,1,1444697661,1444716921
cvxj9ia,0,t1_cvx4u9q,cenosillicaphobiac,"> Give me one reason why every American should not be issued an ID card when it only benefits them.

That would be a nice concept.  How many republicans that are pushing for voter suppression laws are also recommending free ID for anybody that needs one?

I think it says something in the constitution about how only people with the means to obtain ID, namely money, time and transportation, should be allowed to vote.  Oh wait, no it doesn't",1,1,1444693555,1444716921

cvxihmz,0,t1_cvxa2eq,cenosillicaphobiac,"All you need to ask yourself is ""why is one party so inclined to want voter ID despite the fact that in-person voter fraud happens so infrequently as to be statistically non-existant""  

It's pretty simple really, it disproportionately affects one segment of the population, with no merit, and simply because that segment of the population is likely to vote against the people that are instituting such laws.

Nowhere in the constitution does it say I need to have a job to vote, or that I need to pay for an ID to vote, or any such nonsense.

It's a solution that wishes it had a problem so that it could appear to be justifiable.

Alabama has thrown DMV closures in all of the poorest states into the mix right after requiring valid ID to vote.  Sound fishy?  It does to me.",1,1,1444692283,1444716921

As more and more of the essays are published on lds.com you will find that all of those ""anti-Mormon"" lies are simply inconvenient truths that the church chose not to address, letting people think that it was just ""anti"" materiel.  Read through all of the essays.  If that one is giving you trouble, make sure you are comfortable with the essays on BoA, how the plates were actually translated, and some of the more sordid details of Brother Joseph's polygamy.  If LDS.com isn't a safe place to dig in, then nothing is.

Best wishes on your journey, as humans we are resilient, so I'm confident in telling you that everything will turn out alright, even if it doesn't turn out the way you thought it would.",1,1,1444686676,1444716921
