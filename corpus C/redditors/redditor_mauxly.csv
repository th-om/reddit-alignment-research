And sometimes that mudbog is Debbie do Nothing (that we can work around), and sometimes that mudbog is our own exuberance causing us to look before we leap into a bog, causing spinning wheels and wasted time backtracking. 

I'm a giant supporter of lostgen, you guys got screwed hard on education and the economy. And most of you are amazing workers. Intelligence and fire abound.

I thought everyone just hung up on that shit. Nope. I heard and watched the whole thing go down. Fucking parasites.
