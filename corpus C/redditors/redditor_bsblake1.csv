With wages non rising any where close to inflation, sorry, but they are all shit jobs.  But with 150k in loans as the other option...id take the shit job soon.

I think McCarthy beat it to death, and with the ease of information, we've all seen the Scandinavian versions of socialism that Sander's suggests and like it.

And after 30 years of trickle down, I doubt most gen x'ers are scared of it anymore either.",0,0,1444366842,1444728902

Let's take a person like me, who already has it, and add prolonged unemployment. I have no family to help me and moved for work, so no real ties to the city. How long does that person let his kids starve or go without, idk, epilepsy meds. 

How long do you expect people to starve or be sick before violence? That's the point.",1,0,1443659283,1444728902
cvjkx20,0,t1_cvjesws,bsblake1,"You avoid, completely, the point of welfare.  


People lose jobs, hard times happen, health fails, mental health as well, and people need help.  Without help people WILL result to crime,  3-5 days without food.


Social welfare is first and foremost and policing strategy for the wealthy.


If my sick mother or CHILD needs meds and I just lost my job am I gonna let her die? You're out of your fucking mind. I'll kill anyone and everyone to protect my child, and that's the point, so will everyone else.


Life is suffering, we either help those suffering or we'll catch theirs.  You WILL lose your health, you WILL need help, you WILL suffer lose of others and eventually yourself.  People without compassion are called sociopathic and psychotic.  Just cuz you haven't needed help, or won't acknowledge the help you got, doesn't make you right, it makes you naive and uninformed.  Welfare is about safety, and in America where you can buy a gun and 1000 rounds of ammo for less than a cow you should be ON THE SIDE of welfare.",1,0,1443638268,1444728902
