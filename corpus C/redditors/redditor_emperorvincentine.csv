cvsg3os,1,t3_3nyrne,emperorvincentine,This article stinks of a Clinton proxy attack.  The author fails to research Sanders's earlier work and positions on gay rights.  He has always been a staunch supporter. This article also lacks any historical perspective on the marriage equality struggle.  It is only recently that the Democratic Party has become so pro-gay rights.  Sanders has always been more liberal than the party.,11,0,1444311507,1444718694
cvqbjb7,0,t1_cvqaee5,emperorvincentine,Al Jazeera and Al Jazeera America do some very awesome reporting from a more global perspective.  Their Op-Eds are pretty interesting and they tend to go more in depth on stories that tend to not penetrate the US media with significance.  ,1,0,1444153914,1444718694

cuz63l7,0,t1_cuz5pvd,emperorvincentine,It is formulaic almost too much like the x-files until you realize the greater story arc that it is part of.  Anna Torv and John Noble do some of the best acting in sci-fi.  It will become your favorite show.,3,0,1442080624,1444718694
cuodx1j,1,t3_3jcgjj,emperorvincentine,You should try to pickup weekend work at a farmer's market.  Usually the real early start means getting out early afternoon.  I worked for a bakery for cash under the table and bread (damn tasty bread).   *Bonus free and discounted veggies from other sellers promotes better eating and lowers your food bills.  ,1,0,1441217592,1444718694
