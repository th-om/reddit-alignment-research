cvxwxh0,0,t1_cvxwoio,Ben_Afflock,"Saban is huge about his assistant coaches leaving for promotions. He hates to see his coaches take lateral jobs and you can see that pattern when coaches like Nussmier became Brady Hokes OC and *bombed*, or when Major Applewhite had a single year before taking a huge demotion. OC at Bama to WR coach at Texas(?).


Anyways the point is that Saban Assistants that take lateral jobs *may* be radioactive until proven otherwise and that Kirby may just kinda like the work/pay/stress/time off balance of ""just"" being a major Defensive coordinator.",2,0,1444719756,1444724662
cvxvo4e,0,t1_cvxu4zv,Ben_Afflock,"I love what Kirby Smart has done but if he even considers leaving the ""equity"" he built at Bama then that's fine.

He's really good but Bama doesn't need unhappy coordinators.",2,0,1444715648,1444724662

It seems to be a very different situation. Best of wishes to those who had their situation work out better. I just feel a bit aggrieved when I see colleges implying they're a family, or ""that they care"" when my experiences were simply too personal and negative to handle that kind of sunshine pumping.",4,0,1444696546,1444724662
