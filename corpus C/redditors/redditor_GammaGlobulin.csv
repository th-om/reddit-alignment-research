I think you have been spending too much time in Amsterdam coffee houses. Firstly in Florida there is a lot of inexperienced holiday making cyclists, lot of drunk holiday making cyclists, lot of drunk holiday making drivers and and a whole lot of Floridians. (That state isn't shaped like a dick for nothing) Here is a simple statistic, approximately 80% of cyclist injuries requiring hospital attention did not involve a second vehicle. In other words, they fell off their bike for one reason or another. The faster you go, the more severe the injury, including head injuries. 

p.s. I assume the deviation from the mean for injuries in Louisiana is due to gators and cannibal cajuns while in  Arizona it's due to cyclists getting caught in the crossfire between drug cartels and the DEA.",-3,0,1444689117,1444719845
cvww3pf,1,t3_3ofwai,GammaGlobulin,"I am so sick and tired of people arguing against helmet laws using Amsterdam and Copenhagen as examples of cities that are perfectly safe without helmet laws. There is one very good reason why these cities are safer to ride in and it has nothing to do with driving culture, bicycle infrastructure or general good vibes - it's topography. Look at the topography of [Amsterdam](http://en-au.topographic-map.com/places/Amsterdam-4067434/) and [Copenhagen](http://en-au.topographic-map.com/places/Copenhagen-3512096/). Amsterdam is flat and Copenhagen has one hill (not a very steep one at that, but still they installed a cable lift) This restricts the top speed of cyclists to between 20 and 25kph (the top speed of a single speed dutchie bike on the flat) Now look at [Seattle](http://en-au.topographic-map.com/places/Seattle-6623967/) There is a nice strip of flat ground that is surrounded by hills rising to 200 meters (and further out moutains that go much higher). This means your top speeds are higher. In my home town of [Brisbane](http://en-au.topographic-map.com/places/Brisbane-8667/) (where we have to wear helmets) I am reagularly going down hills at speeds in excess of 50kph and that is on a hybred, not a raceing bike. There is also the fact that with a hilly topography you ride to conserve momentum, so you tend to take more risks to use the momentum gathered to help get up the next hill.

Yes, we need better bicycle infrastructure, and greater understanding between all road users (In Australia a pogrom against certain newspapers and talkback hosts would help) but that is not going to stop people falling off their bikes, and if you are going faster, then any head injury will be serious and these injuries can be mitigated by ... helmets.",-2,0,1444657510,1444719845
