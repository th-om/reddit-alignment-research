cvvtag4,0,t1_cvugepo,neveroddoreven,"Yeah, I wasn't even able to get into the overflow room for Michio Kaku. Difference is that I believe Kaku's talk was held in the University Center (RIP UC) auditorium which probably only held maybe 300 people. Cox, where Bill will be speaking, has a capacity of roughly 900. So, I think some people still may not be able to get in, but it may not be as bad.",2,0,1444573899,1444722611
