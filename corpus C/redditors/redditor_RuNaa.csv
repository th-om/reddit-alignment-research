cvspgvd,0,t1_cvso8mw,RuNaa,I've noticed that in the beginning of games the defense is really solid. I think what is happening is after three and out after three and out by the offense they are getting tired and beat. ,4,0,1444325962,1444728610

cvrj3cd,0,t1_cvrhi4b,RuNaa,"The issue with him being a creationist to me is as a renowned neurosurgeon it would take a huge level of cognitive dissonance to stay a creationist in spite of the massive amounts of contrary evidence he would have had to have been exposed to. It really calls into question some of his reasoning skills, what else is he believing so adamantly dispite overwhelming evidence to the contrary? Of course it's also possible, maybe even probable, that he is not a creationist and is lying to gain support, but wouldn't that be worse?",4,0,1444241294,1444728610

cvloxzl,1,t3_3n7yxd,RuNaa,You don't have to do distance-based intervals. Time-based intervals work just as well and we did them a lot when I ran cross country. I would estimate how long the distance would take you and use that as the interval to run. And yes I have done time-based intervals running up and down a street. It's really not as bad as you think because you are so focused on the interval you don't really mind that there is no change in scenery. ,3,0,1443796630,1444728610
cvklhfn,0,t1_cvkklju,RuNaa,Also when at Memorial Park try crossing Memorial Drive to run on the trails across the street. Be careful to watch out for bicycles if you do this. ,3,0,1443714821,1444728610
