The Soviets lost *tens of millions* of people in the second world war. Literally uncountable deaths. Somewhere between twenty and forty million. Just the Soviet Union.

In World War I, France lost 60% of their fighting age men. Six million killed or wounded. A generation wiped out.

We're talking about completely different orders of magnitude here. Now try to imagine World War I or World War II happening today, with modern military technology. I say ""try to,"" because you can't. God forbid it ever happens again.",10,0,1444487633,1444716649
