Do you understand that this is inevitable? I don't think companies that pay humans to drive for them will be viable in 15-20 years, regardless of what people think about it, its going to be cheaper to buy a self-driving truck than it will be to hire a human in the near future.

Why would you possibly pay a human to do what a machine can do cheaper?",1,0,1444629005,1444728898

cvwja4p,1,t3_3oe63q,wompt,"Something needs to be done about college textbooks.

The practice of making minor changes to textbooks, and selling them as new editions is one that not only costs students who cannot afford the books in the first place more money, it has the very real cost of cutting down trees while climate remains a serious issue.

Free textbooks would make this practice obsolete, as its only done for monetary reasons in the first place. (though I would take it a step further and require colleges to use e-books, instead of paper ones, but thats just me)",18,0,1444618554,1444728898

It should be as simple as 

""Shit is breaking, we need to fix it, how should we go about doing this, replacing it with the old model, or does someone have a better idea?""

We're living in the 21st century, many major advances have been made in human technologies, this is an incredible opportunity to rebuild our infrastructure in a way that takes advantage of technological gains.

Roads that facilitate the transition to driverless cars, publicly owned internet infrastructure, high speed mass-transit, things like this that will get people excited about the investment.",775,0,1444590693,1444728898
