Just like the Amazing Atheist, people have criticized him for the lack of Atheist content lately but like he said... you can only talk about atheism for so long before repeating yourself.",1,0,1444640591,1444721730
cvwq8fw,0,t1_cvweio2,HiHorror,"I love comments like this.  It really shows the ignorance of the Right. You have absolutely no clue on how much Hillary has fueled the Woman vote, they are literally waiting to vote.  Oh and since you are probably a dumbass, more Women have voted than Men in the last 3-4 elections.

But, please, continue in believing that us in the Left are not going to turnout. We love it. You think we don't see the daily attacks against our groups within the Democratic Party? The Right attacks Muslims, Latinos, Gays, students, Millennials, Women, teachers, Blacks, Liberals, immigrants, etc.  

haha do you honestly think that we are just here sitting and ignoring these attacks?  You seriously have no clue. We are letting you GOP idiots do our PR work.  The more you idiots have the microphone, the more voters you push to the Left.  You are literally doing the Democratic Party's PR work for free.",-4,0,1444636341,1444721730

cvwq39a,0,t1_cvwimpo,HiHorror,"When he says majority of American people, he really means people in the Left who are for making proper changes in modern times. We don't really recognize you right-wing extremists as American people with common sense.

As Thomas Jefferson said, he is not an advocate for frequent changes in laws or the Constitution, but he understand that laws and institutions go hand in hand with progress. And as we progress as a society and change laws, we will eventually see our ancestors as barbarous ancestors... which is fine and what makes the Constitution great.

And as an example, Slavery was outlawed in the Constitution since it's inception.  We now look back at the first 10 or so Presidents who owned slaves as barbarous ancestors. Unfortunately, we have a lot of your right-wing extremists who love ignoring Thomas Jefferson and the idea that the Constitution is supposed to change as we progress as a Nation.",-69,0,1444635769,1444721730

Have fun getting the American people to support you, but I guess that's why everyone is laughing at Rand Paul and the Libertarian Party eh? What's Rand Paul polling at again? 0.5%? or did he finally hit 1%?",-11,0,1444635535,1444721730
