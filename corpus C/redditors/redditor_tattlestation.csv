cvx643d,1,t3_3ofaac,tattlestation,"Taking your GTA example, I think a large reason for the setting may be US architecture and city planning. Cities are composed of square blocks and the minimalist [International Style](http://hereelsewhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/seagram3-403x500.jpg) of architecture dominates. This translates into more easily made and reusable assets. 

That said, I'd play the shit out a GTA Paris. I love when games take me to a setting I'm not familiar with. Shenmue and Max Payne 3 come to mind as great examples of a fully realized world. ",3,0,1444673878,1444717826
cvw50bh,0,t1_cvw41af,tattlestation,"The TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) is a free trade agreement between the EU and the US. It's intended to standardize laws between the two nations so that trade can be conducted more easily. The document is still secret, so there's no way of making a final judgement as to how it will help or harm our quality of life.

The protesters here fear that the document will lower the EU's standards for environmental, agricultural and labor protections. Given the precedent of prior trade agreements, chances are this will be true.

Again though, don't pass judgement on the deal until the final draft is released to the public.",9,0,1444593895,1444717826

I don't remember Japan collapsing as soon as manufacturing left.

I don't remember Korea collapsing as soon as manufacturing left.

I don't see China collapsing as manufacturing leaves.

I got two weeks of paid vacation a year though, which easily made up for the low wage. The best part of the job was that I could essentially choose my own schedule with 3 weeks of notice in advance. It wasn't superb, but it was better than what my friends were getting at Subway and Dairy Queen.",3,0,1444248920,1444717826
