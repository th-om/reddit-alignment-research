cvvxyuc,1,t3_3oc5zj,srasmus4,"Before the story even broke the sisters had fled their home in Baghpat to Delhi. They appealed to India's supreme court and Human Right's organization in India. The supreme court has given the family police protection though I do not know if they have returned to their home in Baghpat yet. 

The council that ""sentenced"" the sisters is not actually a legal institution but an unelected all-male village council. While its decrees don't carry legal weight the sisters clearly feared that the sentence would be carried out. The council has since denied that it ever made such a ruling, which is easy to do since they don't keep written records of such affairs.

cvvxjf3,1,t3_3oc5zj,srasmus4,"It should be noted that the council that ""sentenced"" them is not actually a legal institution but an unelected male-only village council. I am not from India and cannot claim to fully understand the role of these institutions but it seems that while they may not be able to issue decrees with legal authority they hold enough local power that the sisters feared the sentence would be carried out. 

Before the story broke they had already fled from Baghpat (their home) to Delhi. The prominence of this issue and the family's appeals to human rights organizations meant that India's Supreme Court has ordered police protection for their family, though I do not think they have returned to their home in Baghpat. 

The village council is now denying that they ever passed such a decree, which is hard to prove since they don't keep written records.

cvpdnqd,0,t1_cvoxiv7,srasmus4,"Victoria II is just enormously limited in what you can do in hugely frustrating ways. The way the two-roll promotion and immigration systems are set up means you can't make pop-specific reasons for emigrating or promoting, but you can make pop-specific reasons for deciding what or where they would migrate or promote to.

I don't think there is a good reason for why this is the case, the second part of the two-roll system is pop type specific, so there doesn't seem to be a reason why the first one shouldn't be, but they've hardcoded it that way.",5,0,1444080920,1444730012
