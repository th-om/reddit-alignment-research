Oh, by the way, I *love* the books. I've been reading sci-fi for nigh on 25 years and the characters portrayed are some of the most fully-fleshed out I have come across. Quite often characterization takes a backseat with sci-fi authors, but here people are front and center. The humanity screams out from the pages, and I love it.

cvjo2it,0,t1_cvjnphs,SupaFurry,"You meant *that*? You really need better writing skills. That was not clear whatsoever. I read it quite carefully too. Perhaps I can suggest an improved version: ""*NASA fanfic* is an accurate description"". That would suffice. Or even using quotes to highlight what I said to let the reader know they weren't your words: '""NASA fanfic"", that's extremely accurate', for example. Punctuation matters. 

I assume you realise that ""fanfic"" is derogatory, right? Amateurish and pandering and generally packed full bad writing and little editing. I'm glad you're on board there, though. It's nice to agree sometimes.

I have to admit, this book is so shit it's worth getting a bit feisty over. You have me there. :)",0,0,1443642667,1444731056
cvjnaau,0,t1_cvjlxha,SupaFurry,">> NASA fanfic is extremely accurate.

> I made no claim of the book's scientific accuracy

You literally said this. Just up there. Go on. Look up a few lines. You may have to scroll a bit. Not far though.

I'm not picking a fight, I'm just pointing out that it is held up as a paragon of scientific accuracy when the entire reason he's stranded there can't happen. Poof! No book.

I'm ""competent to talk about this book"" (hah!) because I'm a relatively intelligent human being that has read sci-fi solidly for 25 years. Seriously, I don't read anything else (I must branch out). Oh, I'm also a scientist.

This book is to sci-fi what the ""I fucking love science"" facebook page is to actual science.",0,0,1443641571,1444731056
