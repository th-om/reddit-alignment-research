cvsuoxh,0,t1_cvssoto,broKenMetrics,"Gowdy is not stupid I'll give you that, but Mccarthy hung him out to dry with what he said. The whole point of appointing Gowdy as the head of this committee was to lend it some legitimacy. Gowdy was supposedly a straight shooter. 

But things are different now and I think its only a matter of time before  this thing comes back to haunt the GOP. Hillary looked real good the last time she testified. They have nothing new on her and she has fresh ammunition to fight back with given Mccarthy's comments. On top of that, if this thing is dragged out much longer (a matter of a few months), it will have been in session longer than the 9/11 commission. I just cant see how that reflects well on Gowdy or republicans. I think it will come back to bite them that they have dogged this issue so long and obviously politicized the deaths of 4 Americans for political gain. Hillary is playing the long game here, and I think she is in better position than most think. ",9,0,1444333568,1444718454

cvsowaa,0,t1_cvso8vs,broKenMetrics,"It was a mistake that you cant make as speaker of the house. It made him look amateurish. And politically, I think it was actually a huge mistake. Now every time Hillary Clinton is asked about her emails, she can pivot to how the committee that discovered this is clearly political and go on the attack (something she hasnt been able to do at all since she got into the race). On top of that, if she is able to say that the speaker of the house himself admitted that the committee was all political - thats a great talking point and a huge distraction from what the GOP wants her to be talking about, which is the emails.

He didnt even write a concession speech. (Obama on the other hand, did, and most candidates do just in case) Romney drafted it an hour before he went on stage. 

They ignored months of consistent polling data and lost by over 125 electoral votes. They misread the situation. ",1,0,1444162862,1444718454

cvqh6c6,1,t3_3no03m,broKenMetrics,"Depends on how he does in the early primary states. I think hes surprised out how well he is doing, but if he can maintain this 20-25% of the electorate and there are still 7 or 8 other candidates in the race, hes an opportunist, and he would see a path to victory in that scenario. 

That being said, I think he'll get bored, off message (whatever that is for him anyways) and start to fade before then. Its unclear whether his supporters will stay with him. He seems to have drummed up some passionate support. 

Also worth noting that Romney 's team thought very surely that they were going to win heading into election night, even. I'm not sure thats the greatest track record to be making predictions on. ",1,0,1444162118,1444718454
