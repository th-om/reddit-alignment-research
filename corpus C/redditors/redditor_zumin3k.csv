cvu2vpr,0,t1_cvtzxa9,zumin3k,"I personally think we should focus on the causes of violence and crime in general. Obviously that's a big challenge, but some of the more violent places like Richmond CA and Chicago, IL have been experimenting with behavioral psychology to deal with inner city youth violence, which is where a majority of homicides occur. I don't think a one size fits all ban on certain features of weapons that are rarely used in crimes (the assault weapons ban) is appropriate, nor are most one size fits all solutions. 

What works in a densely populated urban area isn't necessarily appropriate for rural states that don't see the same type of problems.",3,0,1444421120,1444717452

cvtzf0k,0,t1_cvtwwzd,zumin3k,"Yes,  I absolutely have an agenda. But my problem with the ""we need gun control""  reaction,  is that it's from people who don't know that we already have tons of gun control,  and they don't have any thoughts on what to do,  just ""gun control"". 

After the latest shooting,  you have Hillary talking about background checks and assault weapon bans. We'll guess what,  the guy passed a background check and didn't use an assault weapon. It's just the agenda she has,  and uses anything she can to try to pass it. Most gun control pushes are the same thing. ",3,0,1444415905,1444717452
cvtxqnd,0,t1_cvtwjkw,zumin3k,Most guns have different uses so most gun owners have multiple guns. And most gun owners commit no crime. It isn't it legal to own 13 guns in California either so what are you talking about? Give me a specific on California law that would have prevented this shooting.,2,0,1444413414,1444717452
cvtwim8,0,t1_cvtw4ho,zumin3k,"Unfortunately, when counting ""gun violence"", even justified violence involving a gun is lumped together. I think we do need better data, and maybe some more specific categories so we can see what's actually happening.

If someone breaks into my home with a knife, and I shoot them in defense of my family, I don't want to be lumped in with ""gun violence"" and used as a statistic to take guns away from people like me, know what I mean?

Are all of the recent police shootings lumped in with ""gun violence"" stats? 

The problem with reporting is that it's so biased as to be almost useless. That's part of the reason the CDC was banned from doing this research, because they went into it initially with an agenda, and reported things to support that agenda. And when the push is coming from an administration that says ""WE NEED MORE GUN CONTROL"", and the next day ""I'm pushing for a closer study on gun violence"", you can understand why people would be skeptical.

cvtw3fo,0,t1_cvtvyds,zumin3k,"When did he carry an assault rifle around? He only used one or maybe two(?) handguns during the shooting. Why should it be illegal to own 13 guns? Shooting up one's college is already illegal, so I'm not sure what you're proposing there.",3,0,1444410984,1444717452
cvtveho,0,t1_cvtuzho,zumin3k,"We care about our rights, and short of subverting or changing the constitution, in a nation of 300m people, and an overall pretty violent culture, you just can't stop shit like this from happening. 

Gun proponents don't trust politicians to talk about the issue, because they have an agenda. Even people like you, who, not knowing exactly what happened, what was used, how it was acquired, etc, immediately call for ""common sense gun control"" which is just double-speak for ""take their guns away"" because you have no actual ideas, just an agenda.

As far as research, after newtown, Obama did direct the CDC to conduct a study. It didn't get an media attention, because it didn't support the administration or the media's narrative. It found that most (60%) of ""gun violence"" is suicide, and that self defense uses of a firearm outweigh homicide by a HUGE margin. Here's a link to the info. If you don't like the source, I think they have a link to the actual study.
