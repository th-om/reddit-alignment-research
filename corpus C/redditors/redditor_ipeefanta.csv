cvc7tqn,0,t1_cvc37ng,ipeefanta,"While I agree with you, corporations that build such housing aren't jumping to construct the projects that you see as ideal to Oakland. The city council is so uncoordinated ( wanting to sell public land for upscale apartments, tons of space for parking etc) . So my point: what you say is nice but putting the responsibility on the city is an awful proposal. Uber gets it's way bc it's paying, doing the heavy lifting NOT the council.
