It may be a requirement now but I'm sure it wasn't then, and I'm sure dozens of other high government officials have done the same.  On the issue of whether there was classified material or not is up for debate, and it only counts if it was classified at the time it was sent to her, not classified after the fact.",2,0,1444715275,1444731778

When we shoot someone, that is to stop the threat and most of the time that means it is a kill shot.  Shooting is the last option we are told to use.  Medically speaking, a shot to the leg could be a kill shot if you hit an artery or the bullet gets lodged in the leg (Band of Brothers).  Your career will be short and your prison sentence long if you have to explain why you shot someone in the leg to stop them from running.",3,0,1444285229,1444731778
