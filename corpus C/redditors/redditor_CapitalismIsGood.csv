In your case, the standard deviation is 5.7 minutes, so 1sigma = 5.7 minutes.

cvv96sy,1,t3_3o8gv3,CapitalismIsGood,"To add on to the answers here, I worked in China for a little while and the pollution, especially in big cities like Beijing, is just unbelievable.  Part of it is to try to filter the air a bit, but another potential reason is cultural.  You often see big hats and especially women covering themselves with sheets over their necks in China.   You are seen as ""lower class"" if you have a tan because it means that you have to work outside.  So, you try to cover from the sun.

It's ironic:

In America, a tan is a high class status symbol because you have time and wealth for leisure.

In China, a tan is a lower class status symbol because it means you have to work outside.",21,0,1444519411,1444719391
cvv8pps,1,t3_3o8dpb,CapitalismIsGood,"I'm assuming that you have to be 21 to carry in Texas?  Make sure you point that out when people start saying that the dorms (usually populated by people under 21) are going to be full of guns.

Edit:  Another strong point to make is how ridiculous it is that you can carry concealed on one side of the street (the side without the university) but not the other side of the street (the side with the university).  The ban makes no difference.

Finally, when people say they wouldn't feel safe, ask them if they feel safe in a grocery store, or on a regular road, or at a restaurant?  All of these are places that you can conceal carry that you haven't ever thought about it, and when it passes, you won't think about it in the future either.

The conceal carry ban guarantees would-be attackers that their victims will not be able to defend themselves.  The bans only effect people who follow the law, and these are the people you would want to defend you if somebody attacked.",13,0,1444518543,1444719391
