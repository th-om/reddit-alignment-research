1. It benefits this country by expanding our markets and keeping Canadians competitive in the global marketplace.

2. It lowers the price of cheese and diary by removing tariffs and elements of supply management away from the producers.

3. It causes a normalization of wages, yes. However, you have it wrong. What it does it is significantly rise the wages of developing countries, while wages in the developed world rise, albeit at a slightly higher rate.

4. Slave labour? Name one country on the list of TPP members that use slave labour... Just one! 11 out of the 12 signatories have a GDP of over $10,000, that's saying something.

5. China? Really? China?! Where the hell do people keep getting China from?! Canada does not have a FTA with China nor is China part of the TPP! Where does China keep coming from! Gah! It's driving me crazy!

6. No! That's not how ISDS's work. Foreign companies can only successfully sue Canada, IF, Canada passes regulation which discriminately affects the foreign company! That's a great deal for increased FDI which INCREASES our economic output and rises the wages of Canadians!

7. It's not secret, the negotiation was because if it wasn't, it'd be holed up for 15 years by lobbyists, corporate or public! You will have PLENTY of time to read the document before there is even discussion on TPP by the federal government and what it contains!

PLENTY! Where's talking at least 3 months here!",1,0,1444716526,1444728420

I'll be sure to ring up the US, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Chile, Brunei, Peru, Malaysia, Mexico and Japan and tell them that they're ""poor.""

Great agrument, champ! Wanna try that again?! Next time try using a little research to debate with! That's 11/12 countries with GDPs of over $10,000!",1,0,1444715517,1444728420

I can't faithfully debate with someone like you, so why try? 

I'm waiting too, do you know for what? The same thing I said to you over 5 times!

I'm waiting for the ACTUAL document to be released. Holy shit, man. How hard is that to comprehend?",0,0,1444679638,1444728420
cvx5rop,0,t1_cvx18n7,CanadianDemon,"Yea, totally. Way to use hyperbole. How can you prove that WikiLeaks is totally legit, especially now?

It doesn't prove me wrong, because the actual document wasn't releases. Until the actual document is available for public viewing, then WikiLeaks is just another site with another agenda.

It has nothing to with being wrong, because until the document is released by the federal government, then everything is speculation to me.",-1,0,1444673385,1444728420
