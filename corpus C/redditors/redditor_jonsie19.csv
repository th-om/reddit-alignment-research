**Economic Policy**

Dem - Believes in controlling the invisible hand, guiding the economy through fiscal and monetary policies - at all times.

Rep - Believes in laissez faire Government (to an extent). In severe recessions, most of everyone agrees in interference here.

My input - Since we abandoned the gold standard (which was a great move) Government intervention has become impossible to avoid, but should only be used to avoid hyperinflation and deflation - not to control the natural business cycles.

**Social**

Dems - Believes in Government defining public morality.

Reps - Believes in allowing public define morality (again, to an extent).

Input - Since Civil Rights Act of 1964 Americans have lost the right to act in self-interest when it comes to protected classes (for better or for worse). There are undoubtedly positives and negatives to these policies. Some extremely devout Christians reject the idea of separation of church and state because they believe social issue policies should be prescribed by the Bible (which is unconstitutional). Whereas, many Dems believe in order protect certain classes we need implement laws to protect them - even if that means restricting the liberties of religious Americans.",1,0,1442179196,1444729254

cuzz4ws,1,t3_3k6p5p,jonsie19,"I am extremely supportive of Dr. Carson. I think the media does a very compelling job to dissuade people from supporting him - but that makes sense for them. He isn't accepting money from lobbyists, so their prosperity isn't guaranteed if he wins.


Many of the questionable stances that he has (according to brainwashed individuals and the media) are things that won't change regardless of who is President (primarily - gay marriage).

**Economy**

I am extremely alert to the state of our economy. And I really appreciate his simplistic approach to simple and efficient ways to decrease our deficit. He has proposed a 10% **decrease** in every line item on the budget. I like this for multiple reasons.

* First, it's fair. We won't hear as many people complain about X agency getting cut too much or Y agency getting preferential treatment.

* **Most** agencies can afford a 10% cut - there are extreme inefficiencies in our Government. While some productivity will be lost - output definitely won't decrease by 10+%, but rather a 3-5% decrease. Undoubtedly, some of the cuts will cut past the fat and into the muscle - this can be rectified in subsequent legislation. Our 2015 budget allows $3.9 trillion with a $600 billion deficit - this cut would cut spending to roughly $3.5 trillion with a deficit of only $200 billion.

* Alternatively - if the 10% cut doesn't pass - he has a back-up plan (unlike most politicians). He has mentioned numerous times about a freeze on all employment at US agencies - this way we don't cause individuals to lose jobs (such as a 10% cut may cause) but allows the jobs to decrease as people retire. After 3-4 years, about 50,000 federal employees will have retired. Of course, movement within different agencies would certainly be allowed (and almost necessary). 

The only proposal of his that I'm not fully supportive of is the flat tax. But - something worth mentioning.

* A flat tax would certainly be a step in the right direction from where we are. It's not perfect, but it eliminates loopholes for the rich, makes the tax code simple (total of like 10 pages versus 74,000+ pages). 

* While a consumption tax is the most efficient and my preferred tax structure - it will be easier to transition to a consumption tax from a flat-tax than from the progressive tax structure we have now.

* While many shy away from the flat tax because of its ""regressive"" nature - many economists suggest the best for a flat tax would allow for a tax-free period. So, say there is no tax on wages less than $30,000 (just picked a number - no logic behind 30k) a year. So, individuals in poverty would pay no or close to no taxes. Whereas everybody who is outside of poverty pays an equal percentage. 

Last note-worthy economic policy he has supported - stimulus package. Our economy is still in the recovery period from the recession. While we are growing at a normal rate now - we still have the residual damage from the recession. This can be fixed with an economic boom (aka, stimulus package). In the past - stimulus packages have cost extreme numbers. For instance, Obama's 2009 stimulus cost over [$800 billion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009) 
There is an estimated [$21 trillion](http://www.forbes.com/sites/frederickallen/2012/07/23/super-rich-hide-21-trillion-offshore-study-says/) being held in off-shore accounts to evade taxes. And, there is little that our country can do to force those countries to pay. Dr. Carson has proposed a 6-month tax-holiday for money brought back into the country from off-shore accounts. While many think that this is unfair - the stimulus would be **at least** 10 times larger than the previous stimulus package.

* With all the money being held by American banks - interest rates for middle class loans would be much lower. Lower mortgage rates, car loan rates, college loan rates, etc. Supply and demand - more money equals lower cost to borrow it.

* This money would then be circulated throughout the economy.

* The interest lenders receive would be taxed - meaning the Government would be much better off allowing them to come in and tax later than they are now.




**Drugs**

* He has said that he is definitely Pro-marijuana for medical purposes. Hesitant to allow marijuana for recreational purposes - but hasn't given definitive statement.


**Education** - Another thing that is personally important to me.

* Dr. Carson is perhaps one of the most experienced of all the candidates running to deal with the broken education system in our country. [See his extremely successful non-profit](https://carsonscholars.org). 

* Unlike the previous politicians that have largely ignored how bad Common Core is and provided little work to fix the system - he is also super passionate about this.


**Immigration** - This is being talked about a lot and I think this system is the best way for everyone to compromise.

* He wants to create a guest worker program. Immigrants interested in coming can prove that they have a job waiting and come.

* Current immigrants can be given legal status if they show themselves and agree to a payment plan of a certain amount in missed tax payments. (This is important, because if they then drop off the grid or quit paying taxes - we know that they are here.)


**Abortion** - Obviously a lot of talk about his Sanger comments

* Something he has said that hasn't gotten as much attention is the fact that many of the services that are provided by PP are also covered for free by Obamacare. So why are we, as taxpayers, paying for much of these services twice? I looked into it - and over 80% of the services provided by PP are completely funded with no co-payment or deductible under Obamacare. So at nothing else - the federal funding needs to be severely decreased.


* Also supports a constitutional ban of abortion after 20 weeks (when viable life begins).


**Gay Rights** - A popular social rights issue - and I think he gets a bad rep for this because of the media again. 

* Dr. Carson supports equal rights for the LGBT community - however, wasn't supportive of redefining *marriage* - but since the SCOTUS decision - he has supported their decisions and mentioned no interest in changing it.

* I'm sure you've heard about the clip about prisons and gay people (which was extremely misinterpreted - he later gave a statement about what he meant and apologized for misunderstanding) - but even if it were true - how does that change what a President would do as President?


**Gun Rights** - For some reason people think he is anti-gun? 

* Extremely pro-2nd Amendment. Only supports restriction for mentally ill and felons with violent crimes. He had mentioned years ago that he was afraid of assault rifles in heavily populated areas - but never wanted or suggested restricting people's rights.


**Health Care** - Another severely broken system in our country. I would seriously oppose any candidate that doesn't have any plans to fix the major issues with ACA. 

* Being in the health field for significant periods of time - and traveling and practicing in over 50 countries, he has seen what works and what doesn't. He wants to replace Obamacare with HSAs - which would save money and give Americans the power to oversee their medical options.

TL;DR - He has a serious, well thought out plan for virtually every problem facing our country that the next President will need to make a serious stance on. He is a staunch **constitutionalist** that is able to separate his religious feeling/influences from what is protected under the Constitution - something very few candidates can do.
