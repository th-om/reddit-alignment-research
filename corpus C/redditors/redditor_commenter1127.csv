cvxipvt,0,t1_cvx23ah,commenter1127,"> I don't think anyone on the right is making this argument. I think the argument is that human life trumps all and they see the fetus as a human life. That's it. If you see it as a human life, it's murder, and I don't know many people that are okay with murder for convenience.

Murder is part of our existence. We send soldiers off to die, we kill people globally with drones, we let big corporations poison the world... and traffic accidents kill millions all the time.

But we have to make such a big freaking deal about fetuses that don't even have conscious thought! Jesus christ! And then once they're born, SCREW EM, they're on their own.

These ideologies make no sense. It's just hatred and judgement. Guarantee you resistance to abortions would disappear if pregnancy stopped being a result of sex conservatives don't approve of.",-3,0,1444692645,1444721460
