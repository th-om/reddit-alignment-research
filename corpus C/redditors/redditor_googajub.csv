Bernie Sanders just became legit with grandmas. Thank you, CTH. ",6,0,1444689719,1444716250
cvx002c,0,t1_cvwxly9,googajub,"I agree with you on Reagan. [Reaganomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics) has defined and constrained America's economic policy for 5 administrations (36 years). James Carville said it in four words. 

Presidents Obama and Reagan would disagree on social issues but had almost the same economic policy as well as their political approach. Presidents Bush and Clinton were also variations on the Reagan theme, and Hillary and O'Malley would offer nothing revolutionary. I think tomorrow Bernie can 1) make the comparison between the same tired old way of doing business in Washington and the way the rest of the world has evolved and 2) bury Reagan along with Bush, Clinton, Obama, and everyone on the Democratic and Republican stage except Trump, with one shovel.

cvwnqny,1,t3_3of1ma,googajub,">If all goes according to plan, Sanders will have won enough delegates by mid-March to be a serious contender for the nomination. That would signal a shift for Sanders; it would be time to court the Establishment. “Then we have to offer fundamental assurances to party leaders who say he’s a socialist. He’s been in the Congress 25 years and his program is not to replace the current system with socialism, it’s to revive the middle class.” ",9,0,1444628125,1444716250
cvulrao,1,t3_3o71le,googajub,"It's not wrong. Something to keep aware of is the more you socialize the better you get at it. If you shelter yourself you'll find it more and more difficult in social situations. On the other hand, socializing can take away from our self-awareness. Somewhere is a happy medium.

cvuiyl4,0,t1_cvuikua,googajub,"Bernie's ideas are not radical in any other part of the world except America. It's our religious faith in the free market. Bernie just wants to restore some accountability and fairness similar to how government did things in the booming 20th century before Reaganomics and the right wing Christian/corporate coalition took hold of Washington. 

All of his plans are rational, and it's not like he can snap his fingers (a dictator) but we know whatever he can accomplish as President will be intended to benefit the working majority of Americans.
