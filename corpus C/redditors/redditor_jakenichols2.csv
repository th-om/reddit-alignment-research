Let's put it this way, we can't all be equally rich, but we can all be equally poor.  Say goodbye to jobs and investment in the US because taxing people based on success is a really good way to disincentivize successful people to stick around.  He is pandering to the young people who have no concept of high taxes or that ""free"" shit isn't actually free and quality drops when institutions are free from competition.

The vocal parts consolidated etc, instead of a mass of unlabeled unorganized raw takes without any kind of rhyme or reason behind them.",2,0,1444510602,1444728388

Got a source on that claim?  He was in the process of nationalizing the oil fields to make Libya the most prosperous country in Africa.  You must have eaten up that Obumma propaganda in large spoonfuls.  

I also HATE Sanders.  ",1,0,1444510337,1444728388
cvunu69,0,t1_cvunnqw,jakenichols2,"Wow, actually that's exactly what's happening here, he begged this band to pay him to mix it.  The band knows that I know my shit and have mixed some of the most well known regional bands and they booked me before they booked the guy who was going to record them.  He had been even reluctant to finish recording with them because he knew someone else was going to mix it...  Maybe he's just trying to prolong the whole process because no one can be that ignorant of the process, like did he seriously think I was going to mix with just raw takes?",12,0,1444471440,1444728388
cvunf3q,0,t1_cvumzm2,jakenichols2,"Yeah, they had a lot of problems with the guy he like left town for 3 weeks without letting them know and had their tracks just sitting, and now when they ask him for the bounces gives them the raw takes.  Unprofessional is an understatement.  Plus the takes aren't even labeled... I've emailed the band and am waiting for a reply on how to get ahold of the guy.  

Hopefully word spreads that this guy is a douche and people start recording with me as well, ha.",12,0,1444469303,1444728388

Yeah Agenda 2030, but the ""Agenda 21"" moniker still applies since its the plan for the entire 21st century, the 2030 agenda is just an update of the goals and setting a more specific timeline.  

If you have netflix look up the show *Black Mirror*, there's an episode on there where the entire society is powered by people in bikes, their entire job and point of living is just to sit and pedal bikes to power their living spaces, and they all live in tiny one room apartments with screens on every wall that they cannot look away from.  It is Agenda 21 to a T, its fucking insane!!  Whoever wrote that episode is well aware of the plan, or at least sees where the trends are heading...",2,0,1444448957,1444728388
