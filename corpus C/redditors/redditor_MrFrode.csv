cvx86iv,0,t1_cvx7wz5,MrFrode,"To show competency she'd need a track record or competency. Her problem is she has a great resume but few, if any, accomplishments of significance.

She's been running for President from the day she beat Rick Lazio for the NY Senate seat and because of this has been afraid to stake out positions on tough issues or show leadership on big issues. She's been avoiding pissing off people so long she wasted the opportunities she had. 

Kerry as Secretary of State tried and failed with Israel-Palestine but the guy tried and you can point to the decisions you agree with and disagree with. What has Hillary tried that succeeded or failed that was significant?

[Edit] Anyone down voting me please feel free to list her accomplishments as Secretary of State or examples of her leadership in the Senate.",-2,0,1444676861,1444722605
cvx3h47,0,t1_cvx2hbx,MrFrode,"You're making the assumption that a significant reason young people haven't voted is that older people don't think they will. 

Do you have any evidence for this? 

Does your evidence jive with a significant surge in youth voting for the BushvKerry election of 2004 and smaller but notable increase in the ObamavMcCain 2008 election. Does it also account for the drop in youth voter participation in 2012?

cvx02jj,0,t1_cvwzkg8,MrFrode,Hillary has significant negatives and hasn't displayed any reason to believe she's a likeable candidate. I doubt the young voter participation rate will be up from 2008.,4,0,1444664753,1444722605

cvuakvt,0,t1_cvu7t0v,MrFrode,"The part where you understand the options are limited. Social Security has been a massively successful program. You can means test benefits and lift the income tax cap but that has social and political risks down the line.

Perhaps when boomers begin passing away spending can plateau but the reality is SS and Medicare are important parts of governmental services.

These are services that taxpayers want and value ",5,0,1444434137,1444722605
