cvv41ko,0,t1_cvusllt,hegemonistic,"People make this argument all the time, but Brady is worth $120m without her. When you're already a hundred millionaire (or close to, considering they married before he was), you have the freedom to do pretty much whatever the hell you want financially. Her money is a bonus, sure, but I'm just saying $340m or whatever it is she's worth isn't as big of a deal to a guy worth $120m as it is to you and me. I mean yeah, it's basically 3x his networth, but money has a diminishing value the higher you go -- $10m would completely change my life, it would barely alter his, you know?

I just don't think it's had as big of an impact as everyone makes it out to have had. Because if you're going to prioritize winning over maximizing salary, you're going to do that whether you have $120m or $400 something mil to draw from imo. The quality of life difference between those numbers is minuscule.",3,0,1444509822,1444718294

I really didn't like the way he looked because he seemed so unhealthily overweight, and his wrinkles are really starting to show, and I want John Goodman to live forever. Wrinkles are easier to defy so I'm really happy he's lost so much weight (assuming he isn't sick).",3,0,1444451913,1444718294

>Generally, in a healthy relationship, the two people will have discussed the idea of marriage enough that when the question is asked, they already know it will be a yes. *But that doesn't always have to be the case. For my parents, for example, ...*
