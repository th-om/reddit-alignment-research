No hearing teenagers discuss who they wanna fuck or calling eachother names while blaring music? no random person who wants to bark orders at everyone and insist theyre doing it wrong? No random angry asshole blaring every obscenity and slur he can think of who didnt realize he left Push-to-talk off? No drunk randoms?

cvxqmai,0,t1_cvxdnef,Xdeser2,"*It was a stormy night when I walked into the tavern, I entered and sat down in the nearest seat, caring not for who sat next to me. Quickly fishing out a copper from my pocket for a pint of ale, I relished the chance to relax, for I had been riding hard for two days now, no town in sight. Sipping from the mug, I looked to my left and saw him, anger in his eyes, fishing the filth out from under his fingernails with a dull knife. His scarred face told of hardships that he had long endured. Transfixed, in a sudden outburst of curiosity, I asked him what his hardships were.*

*He told me the story of his people, peaceful village folk farming along the riverside in the valley below the mountains. Until, one day, when the man was but a small child, riders in black armor were spotted along the horizon. The thunder of hooves could be heard for miles around, the speed of their frightening charge outrunning even the fastest animals attempting to flee the oncoming storm. The villagers rallied in the village square, pitchforks and hoes in hand, but were cut down by the menacing figures. Homes and crops were burned, children slaughtered. His father ran back to the house to defend his wife and child. Scythe in hand, he swung it at one of the marauders, but his arc was too wide, and the attacker simply grabbed his arm, stopped the swing, and stabbed him in the gut, killing the father mere feet from the child's eyes. As the black figures approached the child, they were stopped by a low growl. They stepped aside, and the leader of the attack knelt before the child, looking him directly in the eyes. Removing his helmet, he revealed himself to the child.* **Milton Friedman** *cracked a smile and, while never removing his gaze from the child, said ""No, this one lives. He is to spread word of the atrocities here. All will know, all will fear us"". With that, the savage horde left, the child was now alone amongst the ashes and ruins of his home.*

*His rage was palpable, at this point, the veins in his forehead swelling, his jaw tightening up.  I decided this man had been through enough, reliving his story for a random man in the local tavern. Walking away, I heard him whisper ""They will pay for the destruction they wrought...""*

Edit: I now want to play a Bioware RPG where Ben Bernanke and Milton Friedman are the big bads.  ",1,1,1444705059,1444719006
