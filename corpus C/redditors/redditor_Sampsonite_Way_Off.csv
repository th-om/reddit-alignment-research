When Spice and Bubba parted it's rumored that spice copied files from the house surveillance bubba had stored at work. Bubba started pulling strings to cut his airtime on The Spice Show and Spice released the tape. The Spice show ended soon after and the Bubba show just kept getting shittier.

I loved the show on Sirius and used to listen at work when the moved back to radio. After Brent Hatley and Spice left the show just doesn't do it for me anymore.    ",1,0,1444331220,1444723962

cvspmzg,0,t1_cvsp69i,Sampsonite_Way_Off,I don't understand that perspective. I can understand there is a  temptation to use the federal money as a bargaining tool to provide other services cheaper. You remodel our water treatment for a loss and we'll award you fat demo contracts. But you have to understand that the government is going to want to make sure the money was not misappropriated. They will turn off the tap and Detroit will get worse than before. ,3,0,1444326206,1444723962
cvsp4ev,0,t1_cvsno4z,Sampsonite_Way_Off,"Why can you understand wasting federal money? $100 million at $10k per house is most likely 9000 houses with 10% for waste and government losses. $100 mil at $16k per house is only 5625 houses. There are 70,000 abandoned buildings in detroit. If the governing body of Detroit can't used the first $100mil efficiently, why would the government give them another billion+ to finish the job?",3,0,1444325454,1444723962
cvsi1oe,0,t1_cvsfzxq,Sampsonite_Way_Off,"There are a ton of things that can throw out a low bid. Inadequate  insurance liability, size of the company, safety record, past performance, lack of past performance, and a score of other things. 

This is not a multi-million highway project. It's cheap demo work that one guy can do. Rent a hoe, pay for a few loads to be taken to the dump and minimal utility work. If you are refusing bids 60% lower on shit work paid for by federal monies, there better a very good reason.     ",10,0,1444314887,1444723962

""Things worth sharing"" -Viral Marketing Hack 

'I couldn't fit the tooth brush into the plastic bag so I cut off the end, but it still works!' Obviously he could have. He even draws the lines skewed to rationalize his train of thought. Throw in some fuzzy math. Add ""we could save"" clickbait into the headline

We would obviously save more plastic if he stopped using disposable plastic bags and picked up an organic hemp fabric travel bag. Oh, why stop there. Switch to a recycled metal toothbrush or wood. Or even just stop brushing and traveling. The one true problem is overpopulation so, be a friend to the earth - off yourself. Things worth sharing. 

Don't buy into this fishing for views trash.

My grandma had no blood to our side of the family and my grandpa had no kids with her. Grandpa died four years ago. Everything passed to her including all my great-grandmother's belongings. 

Our side of the family is pretty successful so no one pressured her for anything. She moved last year and downsized. She gave each member of our family things from his childhood and all my great-grandma's belongings. It's the right thing to do.
