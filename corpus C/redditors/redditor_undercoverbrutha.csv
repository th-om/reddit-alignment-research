cvwjt63,0,t1_cvw2etq,undercoverbrutha,"Only laker and rocket fans can understand this. I think until he plays for every fucking team in the NBA, people will never stop making excuses for him. He's a role player who isn't even a top 15 point guard. If he's your starting guard you're probably in need of an upgrade, or you better hope the rest of the team is stacked.
