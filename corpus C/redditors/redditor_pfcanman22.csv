cvb263m,0,t1_cvam2n6,pfcanman22,i don't understand.. why is this combination of numbers less likely?,2,0,1442984231,1444725342
cvawjd5,0,t1_cvaqzi7,pfcanman22,"since it's a publicly traded company, can't you do this even if you're not a shareholder yet? i.e. you're considering investing but want to see the books first",2,0,1442972775,1444725342
cvajomq,0,t1_cvaiodr,pfcanman22,"i think the idea was to get more funds out of insurance companies (which might result in higher premiums for patients, but i'm not sure about that, since it's a pretty low prescription rate...), and so by making it profitable for pharma, generate interest and funding for more treatments",3,0,1442951401,1444725342
cvahq40,0,t1_cvagwdb,pfcanman22,"good point. i assume this is already the case with most orphan drugs. I'm not sure what the impact would be exactly, since drugs like this have a low prescription rate. i guess then the question is whether this possible rate increase is worth the alleged increase in available R&D funds and interest to find better treatments",2,0,1442948607,1444725342

cvafpwv,0,t1_cv8hbrm,pfcanman22,"honest question: if the company is committed to making the drug free and accessible for anyone who doesn't have insurance (even paying the copay for those who do have insurance but cant afford it), isn't the price increase just bad news for the insurance companies who have to pay?",1,0,1442945664,1444725342
