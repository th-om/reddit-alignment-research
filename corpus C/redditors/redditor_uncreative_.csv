And I also feel that he would be a really weak leader internationally. He's to much of an idealist, the president needs to be realist. I think it's best if he stays in congress and tries to promote his ideals there.",8,0,1443888516,1444719619

The phone I used in the example is an iPhone 6.


If you have one of their new 3GB plans with one line on a 2 year contract it will be $85 a month(no taxes). 85*24=2040, add in the what you paid for the 2 year contract($200) and it comes out to $2240 for 24 months.

Now if you do a 3GB plan with a phone that's paid outright, it's $65 a month. 65*24=1560, add in the cost of the phone($)650 and it comes out to $2210 over 24 months. 

So $2210 vs $2240, and I'm pretty sure it gets evened out with taxes paid upfront or something.

I could be wrong, but it seems like they come out to about the same price. I'm on ATT and am used to their pricing so I just threw this all together with a quick glance so I may be wrong, but I had the same thought ATT ended, or strongly discouraged 2 year contracts and it turned out it was actually a better deal buying it upfront vs a 2 year contract.",6,0,1439320969,1444719619

You should be able to open up your iPhone in Windows Explorer and inside one of the folders will be the pictures, though it may not be labeled pictures. Just copy and paste them out.

Also, to be safe just check all of the folders you have access to to make sure you don't leave any behind.",8,0,1438386296,1444719619
cta4m0u,0,t1_ct9oy3o,uncreative_,"While I agree with your point, I think the guy up top was making a generalization about 16GB users. Anyone who browses this sub and has a 16GB(or even 8) phone probably knows how to manage it and knew going in that it would be that way. If you browse this sub you also probably had a good idea of what your usage might be before you got the phone. But the vast majority of people don't browse this sub or have much an idea about their storage needs. The comment was directed more towards general consumers who don't much about tech, not the people in this sub.
