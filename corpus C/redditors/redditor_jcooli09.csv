cvxpxpa,0,t1_cvwm5ku,jcooli09,"> I also don't agree that things are worsening. I think that is a bias being substantiated by the media. If a cop shoots an unarmed person ANYWHERE in the USA, it will be on my local news that same night

How do you know it's not worse?  Police departments have almost universally failed to report civilian deaths.  

What we do know is that the number of civilian deaths far outnumbers police deaths.  We don't know how many of those deaths are innocent of any crime,  because they never get a trial.

 >Sure, there is a chance that the cop in question is a ""bad"" cop, but there's a much better chance that the guy who picked a profession serving others isn't the once being an asshole, more likely the person breaking the law in the first place.

Cops protect their own, and value other cops more than the general public.  This isn't even something that they pretend isn't true.  

If we're only seeing this pattern now because the media is over reporting it, then shame on them.  They should have been reporting it all along,",1,0,1444703949,1444723471

cvwjnun,1,t3_3nzzw5,jcooli09,"Personally, I consider religious belief as just another attribute that a person has that contributes to his overall character.  All of us are collections of attributes, some are funny, some honest, some cruel, some greedy.  Each of us exist as a collection, and this is what we call personality.

In my mind, religious belief is a negative character trait, and YEC is a little worse, but it is not neccessarily the overriding attribute of person.  I personally know and respect some religious people, and even a couple of YEC, but it's inspite of their belief systems.  They posses other traits which outweigh their negative traits.

There are many devoutly religious people in my family, too.  When I was transitioning from my own religious faith I had a lot of trouble reconciling the fact that so many people that I knew and respected could remain blind to the fact that they were wasting so much energy of such blatant falsehoods.  Perhaps this is a rationalization, but it works for me.

We do not agree about a lot of things, and I don't expect to change your mind in this or anything else.  I believe that police officers are not properly accountable for their errors, that it is not appropriate for individual departments to investigate themselves, that there is a reason why they generally do not properly report incidents, that the situation is worsening, and that they recieve far too much blind support.",2,0,1444616332,1444723471

I understand that being a police officer is a dangerous job.  I get that it's stressful and you might not come home.  But all of us can say we might not come home, and that's what they signed on for.  Cops should be held to a higher standard than the rest of us, but they aren't.",9,0,1444600656,1444723471
