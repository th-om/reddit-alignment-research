cv7pnvn,0,t1_cv7p0sz,its_oliver,Basically we allowed the Ba'ath party to take root in both Iran and Syria which have led to crackdowns on opposition (the Sunnis). When a sect feels unrepresented and disregarded it lashes out and creates terrorist organizations. The power of Assad's family is a direct cause of the uprising of rebel groups and the civil war as a whole. ,2,0,1442733059,1444727081
cv754uu,0,t1_cv74e86,its_oliver,"I guess I have to admit it's my top issue partly because I was weighing recent events more heavily than things farther in the past. The other half of the reason is that the other issues are extremely important from a best for society standpoint but no one is really dying from them of it at least on a large scale. The migrants from Syria are dying in large quantities and children are enduring things no human should go through. In my view this is due in part to how the U.S. has acted in the past so we should play a large role in creating a solution. If it wasn't for the CIA led coup in 1953 Iran wouldn't have had the revolution and the theocracy wouldn't have come to power so easily, we've also allowed the Saudis form of extremist Sunni Islam to persist and even made them critical allies, lastly our ""nation building"" in Iraq has led to more tension between Sunnis and Shias not less. I've oversimplified here but in essence we shouldn't allow hundreds of thousands of human beings regardless of nationality to die and live the way they are living. I realize describing a problem is much harder than solving it but I hope that someone running can figure something out.

Edit: I haven't describes the causal mechanism between creating extremism and the civil war of Al Assad at all after re-reading this. I don't have time but will update later. ",6,0,1442688643,1444727081
cv74i2l,0,t1_cv6wtpx,its_oliver,I hate this viewpoint. People rise to the occasion. We need to create an education system that teaches critical thinking first and foremost not just rewarding the ability to regurgitate the most amount of information. If we just assume people are too dumb then what point is any of this?,3,0,1442687474,1444727081
cv7485m,1,t3_3lkozf,its_oliver,"Good question, it's always good to revisit this every so often. For me the top 5 issues are in order of importance: foreign policy (specifically in respect to the Middle East, coherent plans for Syria and Iranian influence), campaign finance reform, income inequality, decreasing political partisanship, and criminal justice reform.

cv73qcu,1,t3_3lgicv,its_oliver,"ITT (and on most of reddit): people only talking about social issues to determine one's place on the political spectrum and creating stereotypes of the other side. People need to get through their heads that voters can be socially liberal and economically conservative or vice versa. I realize there is overlap here but we put forth this idea on reddit that all conservatives are religious nuts and or all liberals are naive and unaware of reality. When we fabricate this ingrained picture of the ""others"" it really stops any useful discussion. Maybe my head is in the clouds on this but I think we'd be much better off a nation if we could learn to debate and think critically. ",1,0,1442686038,1444727081

ctbixcz,0,t1_ctbhpyd,its_oliver,No I said that if it caused the mothers life to be in danger it would be allowed. In a normal case though yes the rights of a clump of cells who had no choice in the matter gets more weight than do the woman who chose to have sex does.
