cutyho2,0,t1_cutq5us,nogodsorkings1,">Let's face it, how many people are going to have 500 apps on their device?

Sure, but it speaks to a larger problem. A search index (presumably) that totally breaks under a circumstance that, while rare numerically, is nonetheless using the program as intended? That hints at poor software design and quality control. iOS 6 had a similar bug (albeit a progressive slowdown, not instant crash) for several hundred apps, which was embarrassing as well.

There's a lot of little bits of Win 10 that just feel half-baked. Some problems are to be expected, but they start to add up.",11,0,1441674376,1444731958
cutvz9w,1,t3_3k0hqr,nogodsorkings1,">I was thinking about Cisco Meraki... I would prefer something that is not Micky Mouse to setup, but something that I don't have to spend months to build and configure.

Meraki definitely wins out on ease-of-use, but there's a cost - if you don't pay the annual subscription fee, it just locks down your entire network. Had a few of those ticking time bombs installed in client offices under my previous employer; When I left the job I knew it was only a matter of time before they got the emergency call.",2,0,1441669323,1444731958

No, they haven't been socialist. The most that can be said is they have more generous social programs, but they come out on par with the US in general economic regulation.",3,0,1441662573,1444731958

What if the inferior quality of American automobiles prior to foreign competition caused increased travel fatalities? Am I still morally obligated to purchase an American vehicle if it is 10% more likely to kill me? 20%?

Your economic nationalism is at odds with the opinions of educated survey respondents. Opposition to free trade is highest among low-IQ, low-education populations.",5,0,1441662331,1444731958
cutmuno,0,t1_cutjpmy,nogodsorkings1,"A frequent conversation among tech industry workers is employers using their application process as a front for regulatory compliance. In practice, they only hire the people who know the right guy, and outsource as much as they can as cheap as they can.

Federal law requires that companies demonstrate that insufficient native workers exist for a position before they import foreign labor. Thus, they post a half-hearted job listing with impossible requirements, to disqualify everyone. They then hire the people they actually wanted from the cheaper contract-labor firm, who falsely represents his temps as meeting the impossible requirements, when in fact they only meet the minimal ""real"" requirements that were never listed anywhere.",132,0,1441648997,1444731958

cutkl6w,1,t3_3jyv7f,nogodsorkings1,">all indications are that Mr. Bush’s attacks on Mr. Trump are falling flat, because the Republican base doesn’t actually share the Republican establishment’s economic delusions.

That's probably true, but [the general public always has divergent views with elite, educated opinion](http://i.imgur.com/MfeEa3S.png), which is why party leadership has to massage the message to appeal to them. The party base is overly frightened of just about anything, and Trump plays to the views of uninformed Americans.",2,0,1441644792,1444731958
