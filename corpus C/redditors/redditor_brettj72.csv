Look at some of the [favorability ratings.](https://twitter.com/alec_h_tyson/status/581447170756358144/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  Among their own party Pelosi is at 46% favorable, Reid is at 28%, Boehner is at 41%, and McConnell is at 37%. Congress as a whole is unpopular and each side views their leaders as ""too soft"" because they don't get everything passed that their constituents want. ",15,0,1444412771,1444731964
cvts214,0,t1_cvtq4tq,brettj72,"Probably not as many but yeah I think some would be happy. Pelosi and Reid are not incredibly popular even among liberals. (pretty much everyone hates congress and they have both been there a long time) You also have to understand the kind of people at the Values Voter summit are not exactly mainstream Republicans.   

I think my Hillary v Bernie analogy is a good one. People see Hillary as a centrist who is not really going to advance their agenda. Liberals support Sanders just like Conservatives support Ted Cruz. ",27,0,1444404922,1444731964

What is your reason for believing this? [The US is in the top 10 in GDP per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_per_capita) and most of the countries above them are either very small, have a lot of oil revenue, or both.",4,0,1442889143,1444731964
