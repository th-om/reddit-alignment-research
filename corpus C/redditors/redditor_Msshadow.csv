cvr68ek,1,t3_3ntx9g,Msshadow,"Not really.  Transgender people are not necessarily empowered. Jenner is ""empowered"" because of preexisting fame and fortune. Her experience is different as a result.  Also, there's bias in the coverage.  Transgender is still referred to as he-she in my home town and those people would be very poorly received. Lizard guy would be better off because he's just weird and not ""gay."" ",2,0,1444219591,1444723315

cviatjv,1,t3_3mucya,Msshadow,"Yes, I've found multiple pieces of gold jewelry. My old goodwill in Texas used to do giant bags or vases full of jewelry. It was rare that they were just junk.  I found considerable my sterling, but three rings w/ stone and several pairs of earrings (two pairs with diamonds) 

The only ladies allowed to sort jewelry at that store were too old to see markings. They also felt that every bag/jar should match the price.  I miss that store ðŸ˜¢",3,0,1443548334,1444723315
cvgk7m6,1,t3_3mm4kr,Msshadow,"Advanced is going to be really dependent on one's perspective. I would think categories like ""shipping,"" ""sourcing, """" marketing"" etc...might be better. Instead of levels, just focus on topics.  ",6,0,1443412806,1444723315
cvgk0os,1,t3_3mmhuc,Msshadow,"I haven't used valet, but selling eBay lots of clothing was a pain for me. I sell a lot on poshmark(women's stuff only) , but I don't know how well that brand sells there and you can't sell the children's clothes there. 

Garage sale or flea markets are another good option. I used to set up twice a month in college and I did quite well.  ",1,0,1443412405,1444723315

cvgenfa,1,t3_3mma1p,Msshadow,"I saw this movie too on Netflix instant view (some time between 2010-2012 I think.) I absolutely cannot remember the title. The main character is a woman but she really odd looking, an adult playing a teen and they didn't really try to hide it. I think the main crush is Billy? And he gets some other girl pregnant.
