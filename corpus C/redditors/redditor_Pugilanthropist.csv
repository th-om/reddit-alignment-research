cvollyt,1,t3_3ni32w,Pugilanthropist,"Funny story: I just went kayaking in Santa Cruz with my girlfriend, and we were very sternly warned that coming within 25 M of a sea otter is illegal. It disturbs them in their natural habitat, could stop them from mating, etc.

So, in short, dude in the video broke the law and is a bit of a dick. But he did get a good selfie.

Sign of the times, I suppose.",2,0,1444018210,1444729753
cvawmib,0,t1_cv0tyzq,Pugilanthropist,"I doubt anyone will see this, but I predicted he was a a victim to extremism exactly a week before he made such a vile statement regarding Muslims in America.",1,0,1442972930,1444729753
cvawkrd,0,t1_cva0xil,Pugilanthropist,"Check in with me in about thirty years when we've got a drastically changed planet thanks to the cool McFly family you're describing here. I'd love to see if you still think that was the right call.

Jesus, I hope I'm wrong. I'd love it if I were just a Cassandra and we weren't about to witness a global extinction die off that may catastrophically affect all life on this planet (including us) but the science certainly seems to back me up.",1,0,1442972844,1444729753

""Extended Bush taxcuts.""

Because I personally worked on the campaign to end those cuts in 2012 (which was successful for the record), I take tremendous umbrage to this claim and call ""bullshit"" very loudly.

The rest are sort of tired uberliberal tropes.",2,0,1442893436,1444729753
cv9u6gb,0,t1_cv9eun7,Pugilanthropist,"On two sole issues: consumption run amok and the drug war, he ranks up there as one of my least favorite Presidents ever.

If you don't understand why people think he was abhorrent for the world, then start by looking into his roles there.",2,0,1442893174,1444729753
cv0tyzq,0,t1_cuzfi53,Pugilanthropist,"I like Ben in a lot of ways, but I've also seen him fall victim to the extremism that really corrodes civil discourse.

Either he really believes the borderline insane things I've [seen him say](http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/12/dr-ben-carson-america-very-much-like-nazi-germany-video/), or he's being intentionally inflammatory because he thinks it will get him votes.

Both of those options make me lose a lot of respect for the guy.",1,0,1442204400,1444729753
cv0tnl5,0,t1_cuzdg0c,Pugilanthropist,"I forgot about Goldwater. A lot of people i respect have referred to him pretty frequently.

Definitely an ideologically consistent guy.",1,0,1442203715,1444729753
