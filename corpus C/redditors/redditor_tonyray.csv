Would that recharge the ground water?  And enough to make a difference?  Would decent amounts of ground water do anything?

This is assuming that the salt would be effectively filtered out by the soil.",1,0,1444705735,1444731676

cvwibiq,0,t1_cvwdnxo,tonyray,"I feel like everything about the military is:  you give me what I want and I'll give you what you want.
I need national security; you need a job
I need you to deploy; you need that sweet deployment cash
I need leaders; you need to promote for a raise

I need student ""leaders;"" you want BTZ

It may not be a jobs program by design, but it's a mutual benefit and it never gets talked about in regards to defense budgets.  It kills me when the want to trim the budget and they trim money spent on the people instead of unneeded gear/weapons/capabilities.  Spending on the people is where the value is, as an employer and national security organization.",2,0,1444616821,1444731676
