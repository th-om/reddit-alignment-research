cvxp0s3,1,t3_3og8l9,BaronWombat,"While I believe history has proven there is nothing certain kinds of humans won't do to others in pursuit of money, there is the matter of a very large tear in the Titanic that was proven by the dive on the site by Cameron's deep submersible. Unless you are suggesting that James Cameron is in on the hoax, that would seem to be the end of this theory. Or is there some sense that the captain (who went down with the ship) took payment to drive the ship into the ice berg? Seems a very odd way to kill off ones rivals when bomb tossing Bolsheviks were trying to exterminate the oligarchs all the time. Would have been much easier to rig something like that, or so it seems to me. ",1,0,1444702553,1444725006

If we are dealing in hypotheticals, why not consider having some kind of universal contraceptive, like fluoridated water, that requires a specific counter agent to allow pregnancy. THAT would end all question of abortion. Until we reach that point, as a society we have to deal with the reality of termination of unwanted pregnancies. ",1,0,1444269496,1444725006
