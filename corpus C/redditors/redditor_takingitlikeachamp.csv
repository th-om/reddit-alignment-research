cvsjp2p,0,t1_cvs4i7w,takingitlikeachamp,"> You're right you and I have very similar leanings on these subjects. But let me ask this... wouldn't removing many of the gen Ed requirements, effectively reducing the amount credits required, actually assist in freeing up both class sizes, student body, and proffesors because of the added free time. With out the need for as many hours we could lower the hours requirement for full time students giving the students more time to study and maybe even work. Thereby freeing empowering them to be able to offset the cost of tutution themselves with out the need for government aid?
   
I'm not sure of your political leanings, but you are talking about what colleges should be doing with their own curriculum. That isn't really a decision that should be up to anyone other than the college leadership and faculty. I'm not interested in micro-managing college affairs, which is what you are proposing we do. I've already put forward to you that the actual federal funding provided to higher education is 75 billion between what is provided by the Department of Education, and what is provided through research grants.
  
http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/06/federal-and-state-funding-of-higher-education
   
Notice that very little federal money actually goes to schools directly. It goes to students who use it on school. So if you are unhappy with the Gen Ed requirements of your state school, go to a tech school where you can get a Certificate in some career field and never take a course on something you don't want to. I think you are overlooking that colleges are autonomous organizations of academic faculty and professionals. They don't just tack on classes willy-nilly. They decide how much they want their students to know about Writing, Math, Science, Languages, and Cultural study, in addition to the specific area of concentrated study the student is interested in. The University of Michigan has an interest in knowing that every graduate can read and write to a certain standard, has a base knowledge of Statistics or Calculus, and has spent at least some time thinking about the world in a global sense. If they decide those things are important, than they decide that every UMich student will have that set of skills and take the appropriate coursework.
   
Once you actually get into the weeds in most industries, you find out that ""holding ________ accountable"" is often a lot harder than it seems. 
  
>What I would want is a detailed accounting all the money a university spends. I would want to see what the ""real"" reason is for these coast increases
   
You put the word real in quotes as if there is a nefarious motive to increases in the cost of education. Even if that were true, an accounting of expenses wouldn't reveal nefarious motives for spending. Look up the Delta Cost Project for instance. That is a great attempt to account for spending trends in higher education institutions, but it still doesn't really tell you ""what works"".
   
> But imagine if the U.S. Government demaded the raw data of an accounting of every pay grade, tenured professor, administrator, every ""effeciency experts"" inputs into educational programs, and compared them to what actually went into the actual act of a student learning a how well they taught those student and how prepared those students were for a real job?
   
Two points here. You realize that every public college in the nation publishes pretty much all the data you've asked for right?
https://www.suny.edu/govtrelations/state/new-york-state-budget/
   
Public colleges have public budgets that break down expenses to a per office level.
  
I hope you also realize that ""measuring student learning"" is an entire academic field. Many authors have made it their life's work to try and examine the connection between spending in academic areas and student learning outcomes, but it is an incredibly complex field. Even if you wanted to start aggregating all of this information to a federal level. Who sets the target for what is learning? Who evaluates the 6,000 institutional reports? Who decides what institutions get less aid and how that will happen? This is a massive undertaking. Not to mention there are Thinktanks and state-level groups trying to do exactly what you are suggesting.

> Can you imagine the data anaysis that could be gained if every school in the country had to turn in what worked and didn't work for students.
   
I work in the field of education data analysis. The problem is that a lot of the data you are asking to be collected won't tell us about what ""works for students"", since that is an incredibly ambiguous term. I'm not even sure if you are talking about satisfaction, actual learning metrics. Is that compared to a per dollar of spending? What about other outputs for the University balanced against those learning metrics?
   
>But this would likely only be a small amount of schools. Think of the very worst of the stereotypical ""for profit"" schools. (Given your level of research you likely know better than I and one probably immediately came to mind). Now imagine the U.S. Government saying, ""you know what? That place sucks, we will not enable them to rip off more people and will deney tuition assistance to anyone foolish enough to be coerced by them. And instead recommend they go to a place better suited for them that will get them on a truely solid career path""
   
For profit schools are cancer. That's pretty much my view on the matter. Has ITT tech helped some people get a good education, sure. However, we already have a lot more control over public colleges offering similar technology study for A LOT cheaper. There have been endless studies about the downsides of for-profit colleges, mostly related to very poor graduation rates and huge debt (far beyond public colleges) on a per student basis where in a lot of cases the student doesn't even leave with a degree. I feel this is due a lot to the fact that public colleges have no incentive to keep you there if you are not performing. Private schools on the other hand profit off of continued enrollment, especially if you are failing some courses and will need to stay even longer. You could argue that public colleges also want to keep high enrollment, but on an administrator or faculty level, no one in the public service is worried about school level retention to the point of trying to keep failing students in school long after their expected graduation date.
   
I'm honestly commenting at this point to try and make a little common ground. There are actually a fair amount of groups trying to get accountability in Education. Look at the Texas link I shared above. States are (and have been) taking a keen interest in holding higher ed accountable. They are using some of the data you have suggested. However, at the federal level, I don't think this is going to bear a lot of fruit. 
  
1. You would have to invest more money in this layer of accountability. Auditors, Education Scientists, Congressional Committees, etc. More bureaucracy. More reporting. If you don't fund it (unfunded mandate), then schools will all be adding layers of bureaucracy which will increase their budgets and likely drive tuition up.
   
All of this to shave a few billion from the 75 we spend. Even if you took 25% of all this funding away, you would save maybe 10 or 20 billion. This would take years of study, 100s of millions if not over a billion in federal spending (maybe more). All to cover ground that is being covered by Thinktanks and states which have more invested in pretty much every sense in the higher education game.
  
2. Asking the question of what is learning and what is a good education, is like asking what is security, and what is being safe. It's an incredibly complex question that people have been trying to answer for centuries. Even a ""win"" like you're talking about won't make much a difference in the federal budget, and will likely not make much of a difference in the education students receive.
   
I'm all for accountability in education, but if you are trying to make a national campaign on it, you should really put the focus on the areas in which the federal government spends a lot AND is directly responsible for the results. I want to see this fervor put towards Medicaid and Medicare fraud, Defense related waste, HHS service provision. We spend so much more in these areas and are so much more deeply involved in them, that saving 5% through accountability schemes might actually yield a fair chunk of change.

cvr8wze,0,t1_cvqgpnq,takingitlikeachamp,"I want to start out by saying that I don't want to be combative. There are some legitimate things to be mad about. Certainly the rise in non-tenured positions, part-time faculty, and grad student teachers in higher ed over full-time tenured positions is a bad one for students. That is my opinion but I think it is one we share. It was also done as a cost-cutting move, but it has had the effect of hurting the profession by making academic jobs less secure and attractive.
  
However, I want to challenge a bunch of what you've thrown out there in hopes that you will think about a few things:
   
>>A lot of my opinion is shaped by articles like this that state
   
That article is terribad. It says that education has become ""a minor player in higher education"", and it points only to the CoE reports from NCES. That's a great source, but if you actually visit the CoE reporting system and learn what that 28% represents, you'll realize it is a shitty measure for looking at what portion of higher ed is ""about educating"". That 28% is purely salaries and benefits for professors (which was still the single largest expense of Universities). That's it. How can you say that's all that goes into educating. Do you want a building to teach in? How about a projector? Blackboard? Chalk? Handouts? None of that is accounted for. What about a library? That's over in the dreaded ""support"" column, which takes up another 20%. The article doesn't take any of this into account, and uses that one measure to try and make a point. The article also discusses research, but somehow puts it into a bad light. Research makes up another 13% of school budgets, but it is a major output of Universities. It is part of what makes a great Professor great, that they know intricately and first hand about a subject they work with. It also boosts the prestige of the University and is what makes students want to attend a flag ship school.
  
>>This article paints the case pretty well
   
This article is also disingenuous. It tries to make a point by presenting the chart showing percentage change in faculty and staff from 1975 to 2011. It does this without even a mention of the biggest factor that might affect a rise in staff and faculty. More Students. http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_303.70.asp
   
Full time enrollment at 4 years has doubled, part-time enrollment doubled. The same thing at 2 year institutions. Schools are also simply being asked to do more for students at their school nowadays. Liability has also played a role in the fact that schools are expected to watch and care for students, and are in danger of law suits if they aren't controlling their environment. That's really just the state of the times in our society. It sucks. I'm not even saying the growth in staff is ""right"". However, the articles you've picked out (and the others I've read), have done a shitty job of pointing out how it is wrong.
   
>>but ask any college professor if they see that rise in tuition result in a bigger paycheck for them and they will likely laugh in your face.
   
Certainly if I ask part-time or non-tenured faculty and we were behind closed doors I completely agree. They have gotten fucked. Colleges have decided tenured prestigious faculty should teach less and research more, while we hire contract faculty that basically have to do more teaching while trying to prove themselves good enough on the research side to become tenured. It sucks. This change in the last 40 years has been a lot about the pressures of increased enrollment, and increased research. Schools want both from their faculty now, and this comes along with all the other pressures on schools to provide services they weren't expected to provide before.
  
I do want to throw out there that I've studied aid to colleges a fair amount, and it's a very mixed bag of results with regard to support. States are still nominally increasing support to colleges (in most years), but that amount has not kept up with enrollment over the long term. Higher Education is also a first order state budget item for cuts, since they are viewed as capable of raising their own revenues which other areas such as Medicaid and Corrections have not. So when a recession hits, higher education is cut first. This happens at the same time as enrollment surges, since in a recession people start valuing education and retraining more than work (that might not exist). So institutions raise tuition to compensate for sagging aid, and are then hit over the head by politicians and journalists for doing so.

Part of the reason schools need to bring on executives from hedge funds and big companies, is because they need money from those people. Schools aren't sitting on piles of money. A few might be (Harvard and others with 40 billion in endowments), but not your average 4 year public institution.
   
I'm not sure if I see a way to fix the problem through regulation, and I don't think simply defunding schools will fix things. To regulate your way out of it, you would have to dangle larger financial strings, while using experts in the field from ACE and other groups to set targets for full-time tenured faculty per enrollment load. You would have to put hard caps on sports spending (because I agree that ha been an area of largess completely separate from any educative goal). The only other thing you can do is try to make people aware of what schools pay and hire full-time tenured faculty and use them to actually teach. This is similar to the score card idea that I believe many groups have tried to implement (the president might have even spoken to that recently).

cvqauz6,0,t1_cv6hbbw,takingitlikeachamp,">> I'd ask colleges and universities to explain in full detail why they're paying their staff so much and yet still need the U.S. Government to help ""pay for tuition"". When that money just gets turned around and put back into a sports programs. I think the cost of tuition is absurd and clearly the government throwing money at it hasn't worked because it continues to rise. I also think that for specialized degrees, you shouldn't have to take 60 hours of gen Ed requirements to complete it when most of those aren't even related to your field of study and would like to see that limited to only 15-20 hours. Because requiring all those hours is nothing short of extorting the students into paying for courses they don't need.
   
You seem to be very critical of higher ed. It leaves me wondering how knowledgeable you are about some of the assumptions you've made.
  
You are talking about the increase in administrators. Have you been following studies to this effect? Does it even outpace administration at other educational levels? One reasoning I've learned (albeit in a classroom), is that the opening up of mass education since the 1960s has brought higher ed from something only available to the most highly prepared (almost only rich and highly prepared) individuals in the first half of the 20th century, to something available to a much needier group (less rich, less prepared, less cared for). This has required more infrastructure within schools to cope with the additional needs that faculty are untrained or unwilling to deal with.
   
The total spending on Education at the federal level is around 75 billion. That includes K12 and higher ed, as well as some random stuff like grants for teachers and children of soldiers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, Institute of Sciences, etc.. Compared to other budget items you fly over almost completely, you seem to have a lot of hostility towards colleges.
  
Not to mention I don't think you know what extort means. Students go to college willingly. They sign a contract. If you don't like that schools expect you to learn about different subjects than simply don't go to those schools.",1,0,1444152939,1444717838
