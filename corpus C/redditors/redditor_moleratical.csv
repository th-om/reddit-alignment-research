cvxp4kj,0,t1_cvx85c9,moleratical,"back when I waited tables and a costumer said something lame like that I would also reply 

""ha, you got jokes""  pretty jovially (if that's a word)

I would wait for the customer to nod or smile or otherwise acknowledge my comment, the, completely straight faced I would ask

""you got any good ones?""

It worked about 90% of the time, the other 10 % or so the customer would start talking, usually another bad joke.",2,0,1444702714,1444719885

A cop abusing his power is a very real issue that needs to be dealt with,  but that is not what this story is about and it in no way justifies what happened to the officer in the story.  So drawing any kind of parallel is fallacious. ",11,0,1444650838,1444719885

Now that good craft brews are coming in cans I don't bring glass anymore unless my date wants wine.  You can also just bring a plastic cup to pour into if your beverage of choice only comes in glass,  but I don't know that is really necessary. ",1,0,1444603309,1444719885
cvwap9b,1,t3_3oc5td,moleratical,"If you bring you bike you can ride in from the hieghts/Northside etc. 

But be careful,  pedestrians at Buffalo bayou Park like to stop suddenly with out looking,  step to the left when you call out ""on your left"" take up the whole Lane and not move even when they see you coming,  and where headphones so they can't hear you. 

I don't generally have these problems at white oak trail or terry Hershey,  but a lot of people that go to Buffalo bayou Park  probably don't spend a lot of time on mixed use trails so they are kind of oblivious to others,  particularly if you are on a bike. ",1,0,1444602986,1444719885

There are 7 someodd billion people on this planet,  highly unlikely things are bound to happen to a few of them so unless you have concrete evidence of the contrary,  don't call out the OP as a liar.
