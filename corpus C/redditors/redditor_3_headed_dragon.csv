cvuud7d,0,t1_cvupu4z,3_headed_dragon,I love it when the enemy team leaves me alone of Naz.  Build the stacks use Zombie wall to soak up tower attacks.  IF we went by OP item that we get left alone then I wouldn't go with DR but instead take the one to get rid of tower ammo.  At level 20 the giant zombie just wrecks buildings and his stomp is good AE when facing a minion wave.  ,1,0,1444491932,1444717476

2.  Increase tax income
3.  Hopefully 1 & 2 yield a budget where we are paying down debt.
4.  Immigration reform that includes a) greater enforcement b) increased visa and citizenship granted.  
5.  I would make several government departments self funded.  The FCC, FDA, and other would not be funded from the general fund but from fee's from the areas the govern.

I am looking at you 13th amendment.  If the constitution had it right from the start #13 would not exist.  

I also understand that sometimes amending the constitution is a dumb idea.  I am looking at amendment #18.  ",1,0,1444414356,1444717476

If the MM in QM creates a match where Team A MMR > Team B MMR by let's say 20% then Team B gets 100 Gold regardless of outcome.

Playing a game on kindle.  I think it was transformers.   So you play battles of teams against other players teams.  Strictly 100% PvP.  So I have starting Transformers and they queue me up to 3 games for ranking.  My bots all have about 25hp each 4 bots each team.    First 3 games are against guys with bots who have 100 HP each.  First game the other guy goes first and his first attack kills 2 of my bots.  When its my turn I have 1 bot left with half his hp gone.

After 3 games of noob stomp where I was the noob I deleted the game off my kindle.  ",1,0,1444411571,1444717476

I said that is what I believe.  It's ok for you to disagree with me.  

*sigh* some people don't get that this is America and you can have your OWN opinion and not the opinion of the rest of the country or of the rule of law.   You don't have to even obey the rule of law....just suffer the consquences if you go against it.  

Stop being a conformist and have your own opinion.  I will give you credit that other than a few snide comments you are civil.  Most of the time on reddit you disagree with someone and its down vote central followed by as many F-bombs as someone can.  ",1,0,1444403237,1444717476
