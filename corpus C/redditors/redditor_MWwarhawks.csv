The problem was that the judge was a hanging judge (was already convinced witchcraft was the problem before the trails even began) and could not see that the accusers were lying about being harmed by witches.",11,0,1443583700,1444724274

cvg13uw,0,t1_cvg0715,MWwarhawks,Prestige techs have more priority as not being a GP means that Prussia and Austria have huge head starts on the sphering game. Education techs and adm effiecieny are less important due to high starting literacy and cultural homogeneity. Navy can be pretty much ignored until you form the cultural union. Techs that increase diplomatic influence are very important in order to wrestle control of nations from other GP's spheres.,12,0,1443379655,1444724274
cvdeqtb,1,t3_3ma6uo,MWwarhawks,"OP, don't play PPM unless you really want commiemod (idk why you would though) merged with some HPM and /gsg/ stuff. HPM is so much better because updates never ship with game breaking bugs, The creator is really active on /gsg/, and the mod has far more flavor than the other NNM derivatives (map reworks, flavor being made for almost all nations, and an eventual army rework to name a few).",7,0,1443153111,1444724274

While it is true that Bernie supports a large amount of Nordic policies his disagreement on some key ones should still be noted.

I don't mean to start a no true Scotsman involving Sanders and his ideas. I just want to make sure that it is known that Sanders does not follow the Nordics in lockstep.",1,0,1442980709,1444724274

Note that I'm not talking a country with expansive social safety nets and a market economy (Sweden or Denmark), but one with large wealth redistribution and a command economy with protectionist policies. I we were to become a Socialist country for a time we would be able to provide nice social benefits for our poorest we would see a very large decline in productivity due to the lack of incentives for working hard as the wealth will be redistibuted anyways. Eventually the social net falls apart as there is no way to pay for it.",6,0,1442980248,1444724274
