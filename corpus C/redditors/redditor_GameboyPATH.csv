I'm confused about what you're saying. The point I was making is that you can't just get anyone to hold a gun in a school. Not everyone's trained in that, and training requires money and resources.",3,0,1444686848,1444724978

I think that most people with a lack of empathy don't realize that they're different at first, but they certainly would get the impression over time with prolonged social interaction and cultural exposure. But like I said, they could acknowledge that they're different without considering it a problem - if you had no care about other people, would you see it as a problem for you?",2,0,1444681627,1444724978
