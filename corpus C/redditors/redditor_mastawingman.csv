cvvlxay,0,t1_cvvlucx,mastawingman,You sir are an idiot.  I'm done with this.  ,1,0,1444546360,1444721303
cvvlovw,0,t1_cvvl9h5,mastawingman,"That was clearly sarcasm I made multiple references with it making claims that clearly weren't true (who goes hunting with a .45 anyways?).  My attitude is probably shit because you are calling me a liar when you are the one who has been wrong multiple times.  You are laughable.  I'm not aggressive, I'm making fun of you. It is humorous. You don't even know simple sentence structure but you try to argue with me over gun regulation and try to insult me with name calling.  Should we go back to how difficult it would be for someone who knows nothing about guns to claim they hunt with a 30-30 bolt action (first off matching hunting with 30-30 and then making it even more rare with the bolt action, you'd have to see the gun to know it existed).  You yourself didn't even believe they existed when a simple google search would have proved you wrong.  Even if I uploaded my pistol right now, you'd call me a Fudd, a term that is ignorant and also impossible to prove.  Your trump card is a cop out.  You've been beat, slandered, and made to look like a fool in this conversation and you should probably just give up. 

EDIT: also what should I work with you on?  You came at me. We disagree on nothing, the only difference is you are a gun elitist who looks down on ""Fudds"" and makes claims about guns that aren't true.  You also insult other gun owners because you don't believe they have guns. Why would I want to work with you on anything?",1,0,1444545532,1444721303
cvvkwaf,0,t1_cvvkrnc,mastawingman,"I know dumb ass!  I don't use hollow points for hunting.  I have them in my pistol, which I also don't use for hunting.  Since you are so dense, should I go back and mark everything wig a /s for you?   Also I'm pretty sure a murderer is the WORST thing to be as a gun owner.  You can't even put together a sentence yet you want me to trust you can take a part a gun and put it back together (see to be a gun owner, you should know how to clean and properly assemble your weapon) ",1,0,1444542964,1444721303
cvvkonb,0,t1_cvve2g1,mastawingman,Haha maybe I pulled it because I do in fact hunt with it.  Wow.  And I love how you use Fudd like an insult.  You are an ignorant kid on the playground trying to act like he knows what he is talking about.  Sorry all your points have been completely idiotic and wrong.  Also sorry you had to result to name calling to feel superior.  But congrats on really supporting the second amendment.  Me and my pistol thank you.  But it's strictly for hunting deer!   Hollow points really tenderize the meat and make nice cuts without a knife.  ,0,0,1444542338,1444721303
cvvdxca,0,t1_cvv4qbe,mastawingman,"Yeah considering most of my friends have at least one pistol filled with hollow points, I'm sure they all only hunt for sport.  They also got their concealed weapons permit in case a deer pops up in town too.  Then again you already ruined your credibility by stating a gun didn't exist when it clearly does so congrats.

cvv2g7p,0,t1_cvuybs5,mastawingman,"But you said those don't exist?!? My god I must of went and built one then posted it online to sell. Keep thinking whatever you want but in Louisiana, just about every male has a gun.  ",0,0,1444506901,1444721303
cvv2dyb,0,t1_cvv1cy1,mastawingman,Or like my first comment suggested that fox keeps going overboard twisting his words and scaring people into buying guns and ammo so they can all make more money. ,0,0,1444506785,1444721303

cvuwklb,0,t1_cvud5k3,mastawingman,Oh yeah considering bush passed more gun ref than Obama before the second terms.  HES GONNA TAKE OUR GUNS AND ER JOBS!  ,0,0,1444496145,1444721303
cvubrea,0,t1_cvu922w,mastawingman,"With that response, you've answered everything I need to know about you. You and Donald trump keep fighting for that birth certificate from Obama!  ",0,0,1444436407,1444721303
