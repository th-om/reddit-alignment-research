cvv7140,0,t1_cvv6p4g,Elder_Yautja,Well...how about an increasing trend of chronic unemployment due to automation? The very thing you were concerned about in your original post.,1,0,1444515381,1444724946
cvv5zgn,1,t3_3o93kk,Elder_Yautja,"Jeffery Tucker. When you say ""anarchist"" people immediately think black balaclavas and flaming molotovs. I think having someone like Jeffery Tucker on your side would totally destroy their arguments (which would all have been concocted in advance) because he is totally not what they expect. He would be instantly disarming because of some Aryan Brotherhood lookin skinhead you're presented with the mild mannered slightly eccentric professor.

I've noticed that most arguments statists make are usually, either explicitly or implicitly, ad hominem. Like asking ""but what if someone needs healthcare?"" in a tone that is a mix of incredulity and disgust; its implying that you don't care. I think someone like Tucker would be a harder target than someone (like myself) who would come off as more abrasive.",1,0,1444513453,1444724946
cvv5uih,0,t1_cvv5r7x,Elder_Yautja,And in my very first response I said that if someone holds that to be case the burden of proof is on them to prove it. Not on everyone else to prove that it will not have an adverse effect on jobs.,2,0,1444513193,1444724946
cvv5r1n,1,t3_3o7xzi,Elder_Yautja,"What is feminism, at its core? Pathological accountability avoidance. Notice the underlying themes of feminist rhetoric; men are always at fault, and women are *never* at fault. Ever. You'll notice that feminists, SJW's, and leftists in general, are utopians.

I think that is the ultimate end game (not that it will ever get that far, this is and always will be a fantasy) is a female utopia where women are never made to be responsible for their actions.",4,0,1444513017,1444724946
cvv5hur,0,t1_cvv5c9m,Elder_Yautja,"If you bothered to read it you would see that my *entire* point is that industrialisation does not destroy jobs. Anyone who suggests it does is simply wrong on the facts because if that *were* true, such a trend would have been evident not only now but for the past 100 years or more.",2,0,1444512538,1444724946
cvv597j,0,t1_cvv53ke,Elder_Yautja,"If I present you with a murder scene, and say we have no idea who the killer was, that does not make the hypothesis that the killer is a vampire more likely than no vampires.",8,0,1444512077,1444724946

cvv521h,1,t3_3o8xs5,Elder_Yautja,"""Until this is scientifically verifiable, the fact there is some sort of god or force is more viable than the fact that there isn't.""

Just...no. On so many levels no.",4,0,1444511694,1444724946
cvur6a6,1,t3_3nm3v8,Elder_Yautja,"There is absolutely no evidence other than the gospels to suggest Jesus ever existed. Josephus is the common go to example Christians like to bring up, but that is a 4th century forgery. Seriously the oldest versions of Josephus' writing (who dates to about 55A.D) do not contain any reference to Jesus. Then copies 4th century or later have this verse stuck in. The next oldest is 100 years after Jesus, so that is already commentary on a *historical* event, not evidence of the event itself.

There are events in the gospels that would have attracted attention. The feeding of the 5,000 anyone? Five *thousand* people turned up to hear Jesus speak? That's probably more than would turn up to see the Roman Emperor if he visited Judea. Yet not a single historical reference to this event. I'm not saying absence of evidence is evidence of absence, but given that this guy was apparently the first century Judean equivalent of a rock star the complete lack of extra-biblical evidence is suspicious.

But I'll grant it all lets say Jesus of Nazareth was a real person. So what? Who cares? L. Ron Hubbard was a real person, we have him on video. There are people alive today who met Hubbard in person. Doesn't make Scientology any less batshit crazy.",0,0,1444484608,1444724946
cvuqujq,1,t3_3naeru,Elder_Yautja,"1. Einstein did *not* believe in deism. When Einstein said ""God"" he means Spinoza's god, which is not a god at all its a metaphor. Not a literal deity in the sense that Christians worship a god.

2. To pose the question suggests that a universe with humans is somehow better than one without. Better for us yes, but universe doesn't care.

3. It explains nothing its a bare assertion based on nothing more than mysticism. Atheists deal in logic, not magic. Saying the universe experiences itself through us is poetic license, not a scientific argument.
5. Appeal to authority fallacy. A person's IQ has no bearing on the validity of their beliefs. The belief must stand or fall on its own merit, not the credibility of the person that believes it.

6. I think the legends probably are (loosely) based on real people. So what? There probably was a real Helen of Troy, doesn't make the Greek gods real.

7. Again, so what? Imagine everyone in the world who believed the Earth was round was a junkie, and everyone who believed the Earth was flat was an upstanding citizen. Does that make the Earth flat? A belief is either true, or it is not true. The qualities of individual atheists, or Christians, are irrelevant to the truth or falsehood of the proposition. This is like saying God must exist because all atheists have bad breath.

8. Plants do not display conscious behaviour. You have a very strange understanding of what constitutes a null hypothesis.

9. Well your atoms will still exist after your death. Its not like you vanish in a puff of smoke when you die, your body is still there. ",1,0,1444483667,1444724946
