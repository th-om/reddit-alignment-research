cvxz34f,0,t1_cvxv9f2,onwardtowaffles,"Seriously. My cousin works at a high-end restaurant serving celebrities in New York City. Pulls in a grand or more every night. He absolutely loves it - said multiple times that he'd work for minimum wage if people didn't tip him. His parents think he's ""wasting opportunity."" I say ""The man loves his job, he's better off than most people will ever be. Be happy for him.""",1,0,1444728792,1444728846
cvxz1rv,0,t1_cvxuy76,onwardtowaffles,"Sorry man. My last retail job was just the opposite. ""The customer is usually wrong. Educate them. Be so polite when you do so that they thank you for the experience before they leave."" Did stare down a couple of finger-snappers, but overall that advice served me well.",1,0,1444728622,1444728846
cvxyzru,0,t1_cvxksqi,onwardtowaffles,"As far as I know it doesn't violate Reddit's rules, and TECHNICALLY a username doesn't violate the sub's. But since it definitely violates the spirit of the rules, I'd say OP should make another alt. ",1,0,1444728366,1444728846
cvxyyfi,0,t1_cvx7yza,onwardtowaffles,"Dunno why you're getting downvoted. Worked at a place that did a ""bartender's choice."" You got what you got, but usually at a pretty significant discount. I'd always try to make sure that I knew your preferred flavor profile before putting in a Choice order.",1,0,1444728198,1444728846
cvxyx80,0,t1_cvxsv7r,onwardtowaffles,"Also since different meals take widely different amounts of time to prepare, it doesn't really matter if you get 5 orders simultaneously or 1-2-3-4-5.",1,0,1444728040,1444728846
cvxyf20,0,t1_cvxhw72,onwardtowaffles,"Hell, a friend of mine worked at a place that literally would not allow you to eat their pizza if you worked for them. You couldn't even come in on break and pay for it - they'd fire your ass.",1,1,1444725787,1444728846
cvxy0wl,0,t1_cvxhdjp,onwardtowaffles,"Depends. When I worked in a pet store, I would absolutely open for people I knew. Sometimes it didn't amount to anything, other times we'd make a grand or more on a new aquarium setup. Hobbyists, man. =)",1,0,1444724085,1444728846
cvxxwvu,0,t1_cvxw3kt,onwardtowaffles,"Think about it. We have half as many people in America as you do on your whole continent. More people == more dumb people == more absolute incidents. That said, I have family in New Jersey and they all think it's silly too.",2,0,1444723611,1444728846
cvxxvpc,0,t1_cvxx4oh,onwardtowaffles,"Saw a guy start a small fire once. Dropped what looked like a hunk of metal when he went to pull out his wallet. Huge flash, luckily no kaboom.",3,0,1444723471,1444728846
