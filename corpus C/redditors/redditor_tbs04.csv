In this day and age of advanced metrics and nationwide coverage of virtually every game though, the ancient concept of the previous champions remaining #1 until they lose is ridiculous. FSU was #1 most of last year but they obviously didn't deserve it. To show that I'm not a homer, UF in '09 probably shouldn't have been #1 most of the year since they struggled against several opponents. 

My point is these polls are bullshit. ",1,0,1444598398,1444730452
