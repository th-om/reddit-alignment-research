cvm8rgx,1,t3_3na6uo,truss84,"Personally I think people have an irrational fear of firearms.  I know some people and family that can't even look at firearms because they are scary and might hurt them.  We have reps in congress arguing for gun control that don't even know how they work(firearms).  I feel like the gun control crowd is like the blind leading the blind.  

That being said I agree with background checks, but I also know that not all evil/potential criminal/bad people have records that prevent their legal ownership.  I support concealed carry with the person required to get a license but I don't think that it should cost more than $35 dollars and all states should be ""shall issue"".  I think everyone should be able to open carry and I don't think that there should be any restrictions to where I can carry.  My biggest argument for all of my views are there are criminals/evil people out there don't follow the laws.  Why should I disarm myself?",4,0,1443827624,1444720807

ctp47u1,0,t1_ctp23hw,truss84,"To me though food should be cheap.  To meet demand we keep innovating our food production is through the roof. We grow more on less land.  We have spillover though were our technology and consolidation is causing increases.  The smaller farms keep getting bought out because they can't afford that new JD combine which can basically operate itself. Technology spillover from other areas of regulation have hit the farming industry.  According to John Deere even though you bought the tractor its not yours, they own the software that runs it and we are not permitted to change that.  Cool I can understand that but when they also say all maintenance/repairs has to go through licensed dealers where they can set their own labor rates, I can not accept.  It is amazing that there is really no more single issue,  they are all interconnected it is just harder to get that 20000 ft picture.  ",0,0,1438543348,1444720807
