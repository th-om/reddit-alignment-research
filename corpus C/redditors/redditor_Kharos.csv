> * John M. Olin Foundation, Inc.
* Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation
* Scaife Foundations (Sarah Mellon Scaife)
* Smith Richardson Foundation""

> All four of these are characterized (by SourceWatch, at least, in their own descriptions) as very conservative, small-government/low-regulation foundations.  Olin is well known as a conservative foundation. SourceWatch says the Olin Foundation gave $20.5 million to ""right-wing think tanks"" in 2001.

> the bureau, headed by Martin S. Feldstein, guru to Bush-economics

> For his part, Mr. Feldstein has shown little taste since the 1980's for straying from the Republican Party line. In 1992, he predicted that the Clinton administration's tax increase would stifle economic growth and do little to erase the deficit...In 2001, when President Bush was forming his cabinet, Mr. Feldstein and his wife began a Boston Globe article by writing, 'Paul O'Neill was an inspired choice for secretary of the Treasury.' Mr. Feldstein is also on the board of Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company with strong Republican ties.

No. My point is that there is, at best, tenuous link between purchasing in secondary markets where most stock transactions occur with actual job creations.

E.g., if I purchase $1 million worth of Chevron stocks, how many jobs will be created in the US?
