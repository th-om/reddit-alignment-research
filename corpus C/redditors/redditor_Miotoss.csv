These arent imaginary issues in his district and have gotten worse while hes bee there. The only nice parts of minneapolis are really the campus and houses in nicer areas of minneapolis.

cvx9513,0,t1_cvx5hdc,Miotoss,"Like I said if you only ever focus on 1 part of the slavery while ignoring that it still going on in the world today (which it is) and all the peoples it happened too, You dont really care. Its only about black victims 200 years ago never about the victims of differnt color or victims of today. The slave trade is bigger than ever today, but its ignored completely.

Forget about those teen girls just sold, as sex slaves these black peoples ancestors had it bad 200 years ago. We need to focus all our energy there sorry ladies. Forget the Irish, the Slavs, the middle eastern women, the africans still sold in africa today, the white women sold into the sex slave in russia. 

30 million slaves exist in the world today you people dont give 2 fucking shits about that though because thats not part of your agenda.

at the height of legal american slavery there were estimated to be about 2 million in north about america. there are about 5-10 million now as sex workers, or servants. Where is bernie on this?
