cvr7e0i,0,t1_cvquo8b,englishmuff,Hmm. Seems like you might have an anger issue. Think you should give up that gun. ,3,0,1444222536,1444717684

cvqww5e,1,t3_3nr946,englishmuff,"How can one possibly know how many times something ""didn't"" happen because of something. That's impossible to know. It can be estimated if there is enough data, but in this case we don't. ",6,0,1444188471,1444717684
cvqwqep,0,t1_cvqv12p,englishmuff,"That's like saying ladder safety rules never work, because we've never seen a situation where a ladder prevented an injury. 

How the F is anyone going to ever know how many situations *didn't* happen because a gun was present? Most of those situations are never reported, and if they are, they never make it into the media. 

Just the mere presence of a gun in my possession stopped a potentially very bad situation for me. It de-escalated very quickly. I think all the time is closer to the truth. ",7,0,1444188156,1444717684

I just gave a 30-06 Springfield to my son (18) that I inherited from my Dad. I told him that as long as he lives with me, the gun would be locked in my safe, without his access. Those are *my* house rules. He does not pay rent. When he moves out I will give him the gun. That's just the way I am. I still remember when I was 18.

If you were around me and guns (say we were at the range), and you were unfamiliar with guns, you might see me turn into an ""asshole"". I take firearms safety seriously. These adults did not. There are no accidents. Only negligent discharges. Let that be clear. ",7,0,1444187213,1444717684

cvqtxyq,1,t3_3nq8ug,englishmuff,"I have a friend. Let's call him Jim. He wasn't a friend at the time *it* happened. He's the brother of a close friend of mine whom let's call Robert. Jim only recently became a friend because our profession brought us together purely by chance. If I didn't know his brother Robert, I would have never known what happened to Jim. 

Once upon a time Robert called his little brother Jim and asked him if he wanted to go shooting the following day. Jim was making dinner at the time for his kids. Jim agreed on going shooting and (apparently) started getting his guns together, while cooking dinner, while the kids were running around, and mom was out. Long story short, he accidentally shot his 18 month old with his AR-15. Killed him.

I was ruled an accident, and he was acquitted. He no longer owns guns (his own choice) and no longer goes hunting. I've never brought it up. But fuck man, like the prosecutor said, ""at some point he jacked a round into the chamber and pulled the trigger"". 

I don't necessarily feel that prison time would do anyone any good in this situation, but damn man, how can someone be so friggin careless? Same with these men at the picnic table. There is no excuse.

cvqt9fb,1,t3_3nq8ug,englishmuff,"If you are shooting with others especially if anyone is around that you don't know, or kids at all trained or not, the only gun that should be loaded is the one in the shooters hand. All others will be unloaded unless it's in your holster on your hip. When a gun is loaded it should be under the control of the shooter (or if it's a child under close adult supervision).
To have three loaded firearms on a table an not be paying attention to what is going on around them, IMO is irresponsible.",1,0,1444181953,1444717684
