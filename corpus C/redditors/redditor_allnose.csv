cvxh14i,0,t1_cvxg51u,allnose,"Sorry, I just used the Tex injury because I had looked it up previously. I'm not trying to say it was just him. 

Gardner played poorly, Ellsbury played poorly, A-Rod wasn't the same player he was in the first half. McCann was fine, but not spectacular. Headley didn't do much. The bullpen, which was probably the team's greatest strength in the first half, wasn't playing at the same level in the second, and even though it was great to see Sabathia progressively get better, the rotation was nothing to write home about. 

On top of that, you had the Blue Jays winning 40 games in the second half of the season. 

I'm not saying it would have been easy, but New York had a six game lead at the end of July. We had 12 games against the Jays. You know what would have helped in the division race? Not going 4-8 in those games. I don't think it takes a homer to believe that a team that's playing well would win a couple more games over the Jays, and a bunch more games over teams that aren't the Jays.
