Plus the ass is much deeper then the vagina- it just goes on and on once you straighten it out with the first thrust or two.

Or at least that's the issue in Canada right now- we have huge shortages of skilled, high paying jobs yet also high joblessness in people trained in the wrong fields. Too many teachers, not enough nurses, too many poli sci students, not enough welders. 

It's an issue of mobility cause I have 40k in student debt and very few jobs in my fiend- yeah I fucked up, but now it's going to take me a decade to pay off debt and ""retool""- 

We give billions of dollars of public money to subsidize corporations retooling plants but we don't consider that for people.  ",8,0,1444497132,1444717648
cvueof0,0,t1_cvuelyl,King-in-Council,"> The role of the Crown is both legal and practical; it functions in Ontario in the same way it does in all of Canada's other provinces, being the centre of a constitutional construct in which the institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority share the power of the whole.[6] It is thus the foundation of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the province's government.[7]  

Every province has it's own Crown that is not the same as the Federal Crown.

> In a constitutional monarchy such as Canada’s, power does not rest with any one person. Rather, power lies within an institution that functions to safeguard it on behalf of all its citizens. That
institution is the Crown. In political terms, Canada is both a federal state and a parliamentary democracy. It is also a constitutional monarchy with a responsible system of government. Responsible governments are elected by
the people and are accountable to their duly elected representatives.
A cornerstone of our system lies in the principle that *governments use power but never possess it*; power remains vested in the Crown and is only “entrusted” to governments to use on behalf of the people. In this way, power resides with a non-partisan institution that is above the political give and take inherent in the daily operations of government in every democracy.
Simply stated, in Canada as a constitutional monarchy, the government rules while the Crown reigns. 

Oddly it's at times almost contradictory- Canada, it's a silly place. 

> Why is it necessary to deal with power in this way and, in the process, make this distinction between ruling and reigning? How does the Crown, by having power placed in it, serve to safeguard our rights
and freedoms in a democratic system of government?
Part of the answer lies in the fact that governments are often tempted to view themselves as the very embodiment of the state: their long- term goal, after all, is to remain in office. However, the institution of the Crown reminds them that the source of power rests elsewhere and is only entrusted to them for a limited period of time. The Crown and its representatives remain vigilant in reinforcing the fact that our governments are the servants of the people and not the reverse.
As an institution, the Crown is a cohesive force for the three functions of government: legislative, executive and judicial. The legislative function (Parliament/Legislature) is “The Queen in Parliament”
and enacts the laws. The executive (cabinet/governments) is Queen in Cabinet, “The Queen in Council” and executes the laws. The judicial (courts) is “The Queen on the Bench” and interprets the laws. Beyond these important functions of government, the Crown also links federal and provincial governments in a federal state. 

There are actually 11 Crowns of Canada, as each province has a ""Crown"" and there is the Federal Crown. 

I can envision a future where QEII's descendants are not on the Canadian $20, or the back of our coins- but the Crown will be. 

Or there is a massive civil war over the 11 Crowns of Canada in the 2030s....",3,0,1444441033,1444717648

> The body of the reigning sovereign thus holds two distinct personas in constant coexistence: that of a natural-born human being and that of the state as accorded to him or her through law; the Crown and the monarch are ""conceptually divisible but legally indivisible ... [t]he office cannot exist without the office-holder"",[n 13][30] so, even in private, the monarch is always ""on duty"".[98] The terms the state, the Crown,[99] the Crown in Right of Canada, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada (French: Sa Majesté la Reine du chef du Canada),[100] and similar are all synonymous and the monarch's legal personality is sometimes referred to simply as Canada.[94][101]

> As such, the king or queen of Canada is the employer of all government officials and staff (including the viceroys, judges, members of the Canadian Forces, police officers, and parliamentarians),[n 14] the guardian of foster children (Crown wards), as well as the owner of all state lands (Crown land), buildings and equipment (Crown held property),[103] state owned companies (Crown corporations), and the copyright for all government publications (Crown copyright).[104] This is all in his or her position as sovereign, and not as an individual; all such property is held by the Crown in perpetuity and cannot be sold by the sovereign without the proper advice and consent of his or her ministers.
