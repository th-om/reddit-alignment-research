cvtj1pf,1,t3_3o11ii,JeepGuy316,"From what I've personally witnessed with friends I think some of it has to do with blocking out psychological issues that cause extreme stress on the mind. People drink and do drugs to block out those memories. sometimes that leads to trying harder and harder substances to continue that block those stress inducing memories.  eventually it leads to addiction, destruction and in some cases death. Other times I think that some drugs are gateway drugs that lead someone to try meth or heroin. I'm not talking about weed but something simple as a painkiller. Example; I have a good friend who I would never believe in a million years would try heroin but I was wrong. He got in a car wreck, hurt his back, doctor gave him pain killers, he became addicted and once his prescription ran out he turned to heroin. It took us by surprise and we're trying to get him help. I don't think there is one particular reason why people try hard drugs but I think most of it comes from other addictions, mental issues, the urge to explore different drugs, the environment/people in which they surround themselves with, etc",4,0,1444383286,1444731462

Just a warning there is graphic images of murdered Assyrians in this gallery, NSFW http://m.imgur.com/a/zPbDi. Breaks my heart to see what's happening almost 100 years to the date of the Assyrian genocide by the Turks. Fuck isis and fuck turkey, fucking dirty cunts ",5,0,1444352940,1444731462
