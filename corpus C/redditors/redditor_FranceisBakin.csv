Ted was not president, nor running, everyone was pissed about it then, then we forgot about it. All you're saying is that both Ted and Donald are wrong here. Two wrongs don't make a right. Show me a democrat doing this shit now and I'll put him on the rack just like Trump.",3,0,1444332528,1444718070

If you don't understand why it's selfish for someone to deny a neighborhood a clean source of renewable energy so they and their billionaire friends can enjoy golf with an immaculate view unspoiled by turbines a mile away then I don't know what to say.",1,0,1444331333,1444718070

cvrf5js,0,t1_cvre3ou,FranceisBakin,"Honestly, I don't even listen to Hopsin. I've heard his name. I think i watched some of his shit on youtube but it wasn't for me. It doesn't really matter what i think of him because he still has a point. I don't think being honest about lack of substance is appealing. It's not that I think trap is whack because it lacks substance. I love plenty of songs that lack substance. I think it's whack because the lyrics are lazy and I'm tired of hearing people imitate it. I listened to plenty of rappers rap about the same shit but i would prefer a song like In da club which is just as vapid as any other party song instead of some bum shit without any lyrics in it.

cvrex1p,0,t1_cvrbkm2,FranceisBakin,"Nah man, in my opinion, rap should emphasize flow over content. What separates a good rapper from a poor one is his use of metaphor and his ability to provide new insights into common situations. Not all music needs to be lyrical in the sense of style multi-syllabic poetry shit but they should be attempting to be interesting, provocative, and unique. Yeezus has low-lyrical quality but the attempt to merge industrial-rock and rap into a pseudo civil rights album that takes aim at himself is fucking dope, it takes artistry and effort. You can make a party song that fucking sucks or you can make a banger like ""party and bullshit"" which is at least funny because it pokes fun at its own inanity even the title ""party and bullshit"" gives you an idea what the song will be like.  The problem with these new tracks is that they're lazy, easily imitated, have sloppy lyrics (when the have them at all) and provide almost no insight or innovation. Is it still fun to listen to sometimes? Yeah, sure. I'm guilty as charged, when hot nigga came on in the club i was doing the shmurda dance.But when every whack, cornball ass fuck nigga get a # 1 single off this shit i start to really regret the direction hip hop is going. Ain't really matter though because this trend will pass anyway. Just don't get mad at me for agreeing with Hopsin that the shit is garbage. ",0,0,1444235256,1444718070
