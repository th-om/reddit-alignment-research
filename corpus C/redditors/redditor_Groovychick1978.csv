cvwdv23,0,t1_cvwdp2m,Groovychick1978,"Pesticides are not GMOs and I agree that we need way less of it, not plants engineered to be resistant to it. I hate seed patents and I hate round up ready bullshit. I do not think you should be able to own multiple generations of product. All of those points are outside the science of engineering plants. Can we make more strains drought tolerant without waiting through generation after generation of cross breeding? Awesome. Do it. But the fish gene in the tomato still makes me nervous. That's not natural at all. ",1,0,1444608734,1444719809
