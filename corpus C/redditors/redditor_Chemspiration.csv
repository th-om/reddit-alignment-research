You seem to think Americans should give a half shit about Irans economic situation. When they allow continued IAEA inspections for a decade without issue, then maybe I will give a shit. At this point, Iran doesnt even deserve a handshake.

Sorry you lack basic intelligence and knowledge of the Iranian history that has led to the sanctions. Its a good thing congress isnt full of morons like yourself.",0,0,1444701900,1444718478
cvxnik3,0,t1_cvxl8ut,Chemspiration,">You definitely know how diplomacy works. Why hasn't the state department hired you yet? your infinite tact with knowing how to bargain with a foreign power is truly incomprehensible.

Coming from someone who is concerned with why they got doenvoted, this statement is a vacuum of substance. 

>If you think opening trade, but more importantly, shutting down thousands of centrifuges and non-civilian reactors is a bad deal, you should make sure to go to class tomorrow.

We have plenty of trade partners and sanctions on Iran have had negligible effect on our economy, if at all. If you think Iran is going to be a trade bolstering nation you lack basic understanding of world economics. They will fuck shit up. Not help us. They have no intent to help us. None. I think it is you who needs to graduate kindergarten economics.

>And do tell what wise sources you use for your news. I'm always looking for new ones.

Here is a hint; I read the article. Not just the headline.

>as an aside, you don't think that using the Arak generator to support Baghdad is a good idea?

Nope. ",0,0,1444700187,1444718478

First of all, this is not a treaty. Might be wise to know the difference between a treaty and an agreement. Second, it does not deal with only nuclear facilities. It has an economic aspect that is much more important than the nuclear arrangement. Sadly, people like you only read headlines and mistakenly think it is just a deal over nuclear stuff. 

Iran should have to allow IAEA inspectors without anything nice in return. The economic aspects should be separated from the agreement. 

You should really pull your head out your ass.
