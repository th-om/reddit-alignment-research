cu16kce,1,t3_3gqdti,ComradeCartman,"I will never support equality of outcome as a goal, but I will support programs to expand opportunity to those who are disadvantaged. By their very nature, these programs will disproportionately benefit historically oppressed/disadvantaged groups, and I have no problem with that because I want everyone to have the opportunity to succeed. But programs like affirmative action (or any type of quota system designed to create equality of results) are simply a way of pretending the problem doesn't exist, instead of actually fixing it. As a result, they do more to perpetuate the opportunity gap than to close it. We need to give people the same chances, and equality of outcome is not the way to do that.",7,0,1439434845,1444730941
