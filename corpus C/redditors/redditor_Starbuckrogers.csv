I had to literally commit online piracy to be able to study the recipe cards on my own time.

The attitude that you can only learn bar on bar is why we have 3-4 month partners who still don't push XHot for mochas, put 2 shots in a venti iced, etc.

I agree there will always be a trial by fire moment with regards to the stress, overwork and multitasking. But they don't have to be thrown into the sea on *drink recipes*. ",1,0,1444425018,1444720993

cvnit9e,0,t1_cvnht5z,Starbuckrogers,"SuperPAC ads have two big problems though. Mitt Romney - of all people! - pointed them out in an interview recently.

1. Can't coordinate with candidate. Could be putting out ads counter to candidate's strategy or that they would not approve.

2. Can't really air positive ads about candidate - only negative hit pieces about other candidates.

It seems like SuperPACs are actually pretty good if you're an insurgent candidate who's starved of traditional fundraising and media time, and you're trying to take down a presumptive winner with huge name recognition - like say, Newt Gingrich trying to bring down Mitt Romney. In this case the Super PAC ad achieves the dual purpose of raising the frontrunner's negatives and getting the media talking about your candidacy instead (any publicity is good publicity).

I'm not sure they achieve the same effect in a close race.... Mitt Romney vs Barack Obama, Karl Rove's Super PACs spent hundreds of millions, and yet the election was essentially a replay of '08.",2,0,1443936389,1444720993

cvnf97l,0,t1_cvnev5p,Starbuckrogers,"I don't at all concede that PSH is viable, it's highly terrain dependent. That's the whole problem with trying to scale it. You use up the good real estate fast. Your suggestion that we can scale as needed, is like saying ""The US coastline is thousands of miles long so if we need more deepwater ports, why don't we build a few dozen where they're needed?"" We would never do that because it's vastly uneconomical. The busiest ports on that coast have been built along the most ideal stretches of coastline featuring the best natural harbors - places like Norfolk, Baltimore, Manhattan, Savannah, Seattle and so on.

By the way **we already do**  supplement the renewables - with natural gas - because we HAVE to have steady baseload power, so every time a windmill shuts off a natural gas plant has to come online. This is why Germany has grown its ""green energy"" hugely yet not actually seen much of a reduction in CO2 emissions!",1,0,1443928186,1444720993

Like if you listen to some of the Greens (not all, of course) they always talk about reducing our ""consumerist lifestyles."" Except when you ask what in the current American's ""electricity budget"" they would slash, you have to start talking about things like washing machines.

***""People washed their clothes by hand for thousands of years!""*** Yup and there are countries where people *still* do that and as a result, girls don't go to school or learn to read. But hey at least they're ""in tune with nature.""",2,0,1443927268,1444720993
