cvxe6ly,0,t1_cvxcff2,bakuninsbart,"Well, that was an interesting read. But it is a bit frivolous to say I would use ""weasely words"" when this rational republican calls everyone with more than a bachelors degree ""over-educated"" and ""ivory-tower intelligentsia"". 

I never suggested it had anything to do with IQ, but as your source proves, people with very high education tend to have liberal and/or leftist positions. 

One of the reasons for the divide between grads and post-grads i would image, is that voters who lean republican prefer college education that leads to a job without the need for a master's or even a doctor's degree. 

Needless to say, suggesting that a bachelor's degree makes someone an expert in any of the sciences or social studies would be ludicrous.",-1,0,1444685436,1444728404
cvx5gz5,0,t1_cvx3cyf,bakuninsbart,"I get your frustration, but marketing and bureaucracy is more than 5% of the work, especially if the webside is supposed to become successful. Maybe you live in a libertarian paradise, but bureaucracy alone can cost 100s of hours depending on what you want to do. 

Ideas can be a lot of work, too. Even if it feels like it came out of the blue, there was probably something nagging in your mind for weeks before it became palpable. And even if you have a pretty good idea of what you want to do, you have to/can obsess over the details for another hundred hours.",5,0,1444672951,1444728404

cvwvm5i,0,t1_cvunm6s,bakuninsbart,"Fair enough. What I meant to say was the following: With every extension of Schengen and the subsequent flow of workers coming to western Europe, there was a backlash by right-wingers and xenophobes. The workers that came didn't speak our language, they were pretty poor, they lived behind the iron curtain so their cultural experiences were very different. Sure, you could bond in church or on festivals, but that is only a tiny bit of everyday life. 

Poor natives were scared that they would have more competition for their jobs. Cultural purists were scared that their language and or culture would be replaced, at least in parts of the country. Some nutjobs even talked about them being invaders.

I'll admit there are differences when we compare this to the situation of Syrians, Iraqis or Somalis. But the differences are smaller than the similarities. We have come so far in the last two decades: I see international marriages left and right, these people then learn the others language. My sister learned estonian because she studied there, I learn french and dutch thanks to Erasmus. 

While the assimilation of hundreds of thousands of refugees certainly bears a lot of risks, it also offers the chance to cement the multiculturalism that makes modern Europe so appealing and powerful.",1,0,1444656411,1444728404
