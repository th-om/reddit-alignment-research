Additionally, Pope Francis' messages are not confused, I think you might be confused though. Who is better at interpreting and expressing Church doctrine, and theology, you or the pope? Finally, to convert your friends, I usually wait for a moment where they feel open to new ideas. Everyone, *everyone* has moments of doubt, where they look into new things just to re-assure what they believe. If they come to you, and talk to you about it, or they are willing to let you express your ideas, you should slowly try to convince them. It usually works, and they will become interested and look into it more on their own.",4,0,1444610901,1444725098

The only time where we're allowed to, as far as I know, is if the child is going to die, and is cancerous to the mother. ",-2,0,1444594276,1444725098
