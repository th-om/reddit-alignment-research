I'm sure there was some small print somewhere that said I wouldn't be receiving the play-offs, but fuck off MLB.

2.)Somehow continued to perform at extremely high levels despite advancing age and prior career regression.

Look around baseball and 8-10 names are going to leap out at you.  ",7,0,1444454332,1444725441
