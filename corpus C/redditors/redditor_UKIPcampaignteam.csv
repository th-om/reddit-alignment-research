cvn39wt,0,t1_cvn2wlc,UKIPcampaignteam,">for Britain's left it doesn't try to maintain any semblance of military hegemony anymore. And it costs them money they think could be used elsewhere. The SNP thinks the world ends with Scotland, and the left of Labour is pretty much opposed to anything Blairite and would rather use the money to fund some social policy or send money to Brussels.

Tony Blair states in his memoirs that he was conflicted about renewing Trident and only did it because he felt to not do so would degrade Britain's status in the world not because Britain needed them.

It's not just the left, Michael Portillo is against renewing Trident and he was Thatcher's political child.",1,0,1443905039,1444719575

Heightism is the only acceptable form of discrimination these days, and it's just sickening. This oppression must come to an end.",1,0,1433005860,1444719575
cqxc3tt,1,t3_34rdyc,UKIPcampaignteam,"This is mainly about the Northern Ireland parties, but it's relevant here because it shows how little difference there actually is between Labour and the SNP on voting in the House of Commons. It shows that the way both parties actually talk about each other is total shit.

It also shows that the Lib Dems are further to the right economically than the DUP.",0,0,1430691809,1444719575

As for people saying that UKIP would be far more worrying than Labour, UKIP will be irrelevant in a week's time.",-1,0,1430581886,1444719575

I'm starting to get worried. Is Ed too attractive for other parties to get votes? Does a politician's attractiveness make you want to vote for him more? Why doesn't Nigel get screams from stag parties?",1,0,1429440182,1444719575
cqg0vhf,0,t1_cqfvjn8,UKIPcampaignteam,"This isn't fascist, it's just authoritarian and anti-theist. Fascism actually has a very specific definition, despite being used to describe every single political movement since WWII. It means unifying a country behind a charismatic leader with hypernationalism, reinforced hierarchy and a mixed market system with a strong desire for warfare and imperial conquests. Religion and fascism have a pretty complicated relationship. They both share many of the same qualities (unity behind a central figure, support for heirarchy and gender roles, opposition to communism and liberalism) but they often come to compete for control of a country. Franco was a Catholic, Mussolini an atheist, and Hitler had an everchanging view of Christianity.

Antitheism is a relic of communism, to be sure. But the government of Tajikstan isn't dedicated to eradicating religion for ideological purposes like Lenin and Trotsky were, but instead to control the masses and suppress chances of an Wahhabi uprising.",1,0,1429314764,1444719575
