The later in the beta it gets, the rebels win more because people are figuring out what is going on.

He can do things like jump on a vehicle, making the driver freak out, and shoots another vehicle. He starts juggling grenades he found, only to slip and toss them around, doing AOE damage. If we used TCW as canon for Jar Jar feats, he has some decent moves. He can also control aquatic animals. 

You gotta admit it would be hilarious if anything. Everyone on the map just going full auto on Jar Jar because fuck him, only they are doing exactly what is intended by getting distracted.",3,0,1444656922,1444729723

This is my only problem. I honestly don't think you have a proper scale of how large their operation is. This isn't some back woods amateur operation here, it's massive. It's the size of the midwest, and it's protected by insurgents. 

All this bullshit about the CIA is just distracting. I don't think we disagree on too much, I'm sorry if I misrepresented you in any way. I don't want to leave this conversation on a sour foot.",1,0,1444369410,1444729723
cvt9xpa,1,t3_3o15kd,csbob2010,">views on foreign policy are consistent with the teachings of Jesus (particularly His teachings on forgiveness and nonviolence).

This is sort of a gotcha question. The same could be said about some economic questions about wealth, inequality and such. It all depends on how you word the question.

Ask it like what is the relationship between Jesus' teachings and US foreign policy, and/or should they be related?",7,0,1444357962,1444729723
cvt8y69,0,t1_cvmoa1b,csbob2010,"I know this is anecdotal bullshit, but I have a friend on the USSS. He said pretty much the same thing about the Clintons. It is considered by far the worst post in the entire Service.

He said things like she refused to open doors for themselves, Hillary would just walk up to the door and stand there staring at it, like she didn't know how to open it. 

They make the USSS agents that work for them pay ridiculous rent (no one else does this, and they are rich) in some shitty 'house' in the back of their property, and they treat them like shit. 

They hate her, a lot. He went out of his way to point out he would never talk about anyone in his job, but fuck the Clintons. 

From what I gathered they like Obama and Biden a lot though.",1,0,1444356334,1444729723
