Doesn't change the fact Columbus was an asshole.  Like, just because whites suffered too that makes it okay they oppressed before?

Seems petty.  Simpler solution, praise no oppressors with national holiday and folk hero status.  This 'white guilt' plays little part in it.",7,0,1444684512,1444719721
cvtgkq9,0,t1_cvtfxr0,PvtJet07,"So, because they're poor, they should only eat shit food that barely gives you the energy to wake up in the morning and slog to work.  No fruits or veggies for your kids brain growth, just carbs, a little protein, and lots of salt.  Probably candy and junk food too, since walking to the 7-11 is easier than walking 40 minutes to meijer and 40 back with 5 bags of groceries, and your EBT card doesn't buy gas.

Sounds like the land of equal opportunity to me.  That kid's gonna grow up to go to Harvard, I'll tell you what.  

Or are you saying poor people are poor because they deserve it because they're too stupid or made too many poor decisions, and thus thrown away all their (and their kid's) opportunities to progress?  Lemme go call the Knights of Columbus and tell them to cancel the food drive at church tomorrow, poor don't need it, they got plenty of ramen.",5,0,1444373089,1444719721

Take 25 year old Bill Gates, clone hime 20,000 times, and place him in a prebuilt city (thus ignoring any annoyingly complex issues like family educational background, family wealth, societal minority prejudice,etc)

Are they all CEOs?  Who makes the food?  Mops the floors?  Clerks the banks?

Not everyone can be a CEO even if they're all paragons of intelligence.  And in reality different people had different incomes as kids, perhaps, UNEQUAL ones, that provide them different opportunities to go to college, take unpaid internships, pay rent while job hunting, buy nutritious food to stay healthy, etc.

It matters.

The single most telling factor in post secondary school attendance is the education level of your parents.  Income inequality matters.",1,0,1444371836,1444719721

We don't necessarily want to BE europe.  We love guaranteed free speech, a multicultural society, and our economic and political freedom that many take for granted.  

We just want to take their best parts and incorporate them into an already successful system.",14,0,1443903451,1444719721
