cvwn5it,1,t3_3oexp7,Handsomejack94,"Martin Luther King Jr's essay *Letter from a Birmingham Jail* covers this topic pretty thoroughly, although he's talking about illegal public protest rather than jury nullification.

Social contract theory would be a good thing to look over as well, since that will probably be the basis of an argument against jury nullification.

Does that mean that a corporation that acts rationally, with its own autonomous will, has moral obligations? Corporations certainly have a material impact on the lives of other moral agents (ie people), so I think its fundamentally reductive to say they don't have any moral responsibility at all. If GMs car explodes and burns me, they have a moral obligation to redress that wrong. Does that obligation apply to the company collectively, or to each employee individually?

cvmeka8,1,t3_3natdb,Handsomejack94,"I'll try being a devil's advocate.

Are these the same conditions required to be a moral agent? As in, someone who is bound by morality and must make moral decisions? Or is there another qualification, like rationality, that is necessary?

If they're not, why do these things get the privileged status of being treated morally without having to act morally themselves?
