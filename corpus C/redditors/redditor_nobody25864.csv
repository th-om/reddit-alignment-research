So what you gotta do is make sure that if your football team *doesn't* win, then the world would be worse off. I don't know, vow to become the next Hitler or something. This would make the world worse off, making it impossible, guaranteeing that your team will win!

But the trick to this is you *really* gotta mean it. If you go in halfsies, it won't work.",1,0,1444671402,1444722101

Knight of Soul matches Frisk *perfectly*. Exploits his own soul like nobody's business. 

And what's Chara, a Thief or a Rogue of Doom? I don't see it either way.

cvwhuev,1,t3_3od5hy,nobody25864,"Libertarians believe that the use of force is justified when it's defensive. The warlord here would obviously be violating this principle, and defensive force would be justified.

Since every individual has the right to self-defense, this right might be ""hired out"" to a professional defender do the defending for you. This is precisely what governments and the law are meant to be.

Libertarians are not anti-government, in spite of the rhetoric you see here. In fact, we are very much pro-government. We love it when people's rights are defended.

What we are against is the *distortion* of government, which is one of the greatest evils imaginable. A government that violates property rights instead of defending them is like a doctor that makes you sick. It's a perversion of the natural order of things.

I suggest you read [The Law](http://bastiat.org/en/the_law.html) by Frederic Bastiat. It's about as good a statement of our principles as any other. If you want to get more into how libertarians would see security services justly provided, I suggest reading [The Production of Security](http://praxeology.net/GM-PS.htm) by Gustave de Molinari.
