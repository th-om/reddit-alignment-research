cvmhfzx,0,t1_cvmcjal,S_Seaborn,I did thank them in person. I didn't have cash to offer. I couldn't afford an Uber to get to my new place because security deposit and rent. Thus the walking. My phone got snatched out of my hands two weeks ago. Thus the not getting contact info. I offered and asked because I did have a pen and paper. They said it's all good and took off. ,30,0,1443846692,1444727992

cv48jvq,0,t1_cv3s9yx,S_Seaborn,"Incumbent presidents already have campaign apparati in place in those states and arguably all 50 states. Obama, or surrogates (Biden or Michelle) visited NH 6 times in 2012. Point being that they are still actively campaigning, and fundraising, well before February of E-year.

cv48e1q,0,t1_cv3zmqd,S_Seaborn,"Not at all what I was advocating. There are already limits on duration for fundraising and contribution limits (without being a candidate), so outright politicking can be regulated. Political parties are not supposed to host debates, but we allow them to endorse debates - this, too, can be curtailed. 

Sure, you may not be able to stop rallies from occurring - though I think that this could be contested as well - but there are things that can be done in order to shorten, or at least curtail, election season. ",1,0,1442454775,1444727992
cv3rw88,0,t1_cv3ri44,S_Seaborn,"Not necessarily true. Every (federally) elected official begins to campaign for reelection the day after being sworn in to office by fundraising. If they don't have a war chest, they won't be competitive in a general. Fundraising goes on continuously but starts in earnest during the primary season regardless of whether the presumptive nominee is an incumbent. ",3,0,1442428610,1444727992
cv3nqzp,0,t1_cv3n6i0,S_Seaborn,There would likely be a scaling up of the minimum wage. Asking for $15 and adjusting over 10-15 years in smaller intervals would allow them to tie it to inflation and adjust the pay accordingly. ,1,0,1442422540,1444727992
cv3lzyw,0,t1_cv3kbjp,S_Seaborn,"Well, for starters, we could limit the election season. ",3,0,1442419956,1444727992
