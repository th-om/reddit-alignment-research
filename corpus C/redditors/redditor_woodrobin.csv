He then quit them cold turkey, as they were causing mood swings and other erratic behavior.  This was during the campy Justice League International series -- probably not canonical now.  Anything flambe is right out, of course.  Severe pyrophobia.

Flash's Tour of Italy would involve an actual tour of Italy, of course.  When you can run near the speed of light, the whole world is your buffet table.",3,0,1444678053,1444719597
cvwx3k7,1,t3_3og15c,woodrobin,"I expected this to address what the characters typically ate, rather than the actors.  This was fairly informative, and certainly healthier.  The characters would be more like:

1.  Wolverine: Beer, hemp wine (apparently the only beverage that gives him a hangover), chips, brats.  General pub food seems to be his preferred range.

2.  Batman: Alfred tends to fix him easy-to-eat meals and bring them down to the Batcave, but apparently Bruce Wayne finds grilling a steak a relaxing experience.

3.  Thor:  Apparently Jarvis (the comic version butler, not the cinematic AI) does amazing things with roast boar, and his Jarvis Java is unparalleled in the halls of Asgard.

4.  Superman:  Clark Kent is a huge fan of Beef Bourguignon with ketchup.  As a fellow Kansan, I would like to say we do not all desecrate bourguignon in this manner.  Maybe it's a Kryptonian thing.

5.  Captain America:  Apparently a big fan of apple pie (as one would expect) and misses the old Coney Island hot dogs from his youth.

6.  Deadpool:  Heavily into chimichangas.

7.  Star-Lord:  Not noted, although given his dating tendencies, a different alien cuisine each week seems about his speed.

8.  Spider-Man:  Apparently near-addicted to Aunt May's cherry pie recipe, and the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (with the crust removed) she still fixes him.  ",22,0,1444659563,1444719597

Adds crafting recipes for converting bows to scoped bows (basically, the ingredients are the original bow and glass (same stuff used in Hearthfires for the display cases and suchlike)).  It also adds scoped bows to the leveled lists and changes a few unique bows' appearances to make them scoped.

The upper scope lines up for standing archery, and the lower one for sneak-shooting.",12,0,1444420124,1444719597

cvsrehj,0,t1_cvsl5hc,woodrobin,"You might like [Humorous Naked Comments](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52095/?).  It changes out the rude and bossy nude comments for things like ""You should probably put that thing away before you knock something over"" or ""Now that's a real man!"" for males and ""By Ysmir! That's impressive!"" and ""That's . . . that's . . . wow!"" for females.

The voices are fully face-movement animated, since the mod re-purposed comments about unsheathed weapons and impressive landmarks instead of adding new dialogue.

It makes the people of Skyrim seem more earthy and funny, and less prudish and snarky.",239,0,1444328754,1444719597

I'd recommend trying that first, and only breaking out the propane and propane accessories if the self-cleaning cycle doesn't do the job.",3,0,1444261497,1444719597
cvobask,0,t1_cvk7n7m,woodrobin,"1.  As mentioned, the Mandarin is real in the MCU.  Killian hired someone to pretend to be the Mandarin . . . he didn't make the Mandarin up out of whole cloth.

2.  The Red Skull was Hitler's right hand man and his ""ideal Nazi,"" as well as the head of a group that evolved into Hydra after the war, in the comics.  The only thing they changed was having Red Skull name it Hydra instead of Baron Strucker.

3.  In the comics, Peter Quill sees mercenaries kill his mother, then later gets into space as an astronaut, then gets a sentient ship named Ship that used to be a star and sometimes turns into a woman from a mysterious mentor named the Master of the Sun.  His comics origin jumps a whole school of sharks.  I do not blame the MCU folks for streamlining it, and actually like his movie origin better.

Yes, they do change origins sometimes.  One out of three examples pertain to that.  The MCU is not supposed to be the same universe as the main Marvel or Ultimate Marvel comics universes, so a remixing of events is justified in the context of all three canons.",2,0,1443999495,1444719597

His is a difference of restraint and subtlety (inasmuch as he exhibits neither).  He would be a very biting satire of evangelism, if he wasn't completely serious.",1,0,1443996594,1444719597
