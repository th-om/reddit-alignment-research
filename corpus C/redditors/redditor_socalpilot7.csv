cvxr46k,1,t3_3oinxv,socalpilot7,"Tonight I just made saut√©ed yellow squash, zucchini, onion, and tomatoes over wheat penne with a little marinara. I also made a ""parmesean"" using a recipe from the Minimalist Baker, and sprinkled that over the pasta. Super good and easy!

The parmesean is:

3/4 cup cashews

3tbsp nutritional yeast

1/4 tsp garlic powder

3/4 tsp salt

Them grind everything in a food processor.",1,0,1444705861,1444730280

cvrpq70,0,t1_cvrmifl,socalpilot7,"So you care about animals, but it would be okay to drive a Hummer? That's like someone who drives a Nissan Leaf and eats meat. They aren't truly supporting their cause. They're basically saying ""I care about the environment, and will drive a car that is ""green"", but I like meat and even though it's bad for the environment (which I care about), I continue to eat it because it tastes good."" I think by being a vegan, you're also an advocate for the environment. ",1,0,1444250847,1444730280
cvqz5f5,1,t3_3nsvth,socalpilot7,"I'm new to veganism. There really is no need for humans to consume dairy products. So the only reason we do is because it tastes good. That doesn't justify the exploitation of dairy cows and their calves. Plus we are biologically meant to drink milk only for the first couple years of life. Lacoste tolerance is a genetic mutation. Dairy isn't particularly good for you either.
