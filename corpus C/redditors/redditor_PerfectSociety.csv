cvxfoc9,0,t1_cvwnxa0,PerfectSociety,"FDR also forcefully nationalized a major war manufacturer. Despite all this, you think Bernie is to the left of FDR? You've gotta be kidding. ",1,0,1444687761,1444716636
cvxfc31,0,t1_cvwnxa0,PerfectSociety,"Lol FDR would be to the left of Bernie. He wanted a maximum wage, actual socialist programs like a jobs guarantee, creation of GSEs, arguably the most interventionist industrial policy we've ever had, etc.... He'd be labeled a communist by republicans today. FDR was the only true socialist president we ever had. ",1,0,1444687224,1444716636
cvxew47,0,t1_cvx6j9l,PerfectSociety,"Could you please link me some evidence about your pre-1980 inflation/CPI stats? Also, in a gold-backed currency system, how can a country climb out of a recession or depression? Is your approach to just wait it out? ",1,0,1444686540,1444716636
cvxetix,0,t1_cvx6821,PerfectSociety,"I don't see how this would happen unless you created a law which prevents the current business leadership from simply reporting those things and therefore creating an artificial monopoly on this information that only the union can release. What would stop the business leadership from releasing that info themselves to the non-profit? Also, what stops the new investors and shareholders from mandating that the COO comes up with such figures and info on a quarterly basis? This would remove the usefulness of the Union in your scenario right? ",1,0,1444686426,1444716636
cvwsu0w,0,t1_cvwo8dl,PerfectSociety,"I'd like to hear your explanation for why the government is more responsible than the banks, if u don't mind. ",1,0,1444647808,1444716636
cvwpwfg,0,t1_cvwm7tj,PerfectSociety,"This could be addressed by indexing the MW to inflation. In general the charts that compare CPI with wages show that wages have largely kept up. I'd like to see some evidence/charts that show otherwise if you don't mind. I'm honestly interested in what you are saying, but I need to see some evidence. On a larger note, I think the fundamental problems that cause recessions and depressions in U.S. History (if you analyze the worst ones and remove those that were caused by external factors involving wars, etc...) are: interest and speculation. I think we should adopt a monetary system based on Gesell's Freiwirtschaft and we should accompany that monetary system with a tiny land value tax and a Financial Transaction Tax. Furthermore, we should re-instate and modernize Glass-Steagal. That combination should prevent speculative asset bubbles and remove the debt-based pressure that forces companies to continually expand or go under. In addition, this prevents people from losing their savings from bad investments done by banks and also encourages loans to SMEs. Lastly, this would also provide enough monetary flexibility to allow stimulative monetary and fiscal policy. ",1,0,1444635044,1444716636
cvwoby1,0,t1_cvwmbw4,PerfectSociety,"As far as unions evolving, I agree on that - although we probably disagree on how they should have evolved. I think the U.S. should have evolved to become like the current German social market model, in which unions actually benefit the german companies by using connections to vocational schools to train and create a highly specialized workforce that help the companies compete better internationally. In additional the German co-determination policies, kurzarbeit, and horizontal integration are all very helpful in keeping wages high, protecting jobs, while also increasing the competitiveness of the company. This is all a part of the German Social Market model - a product of German Industrial Policy. ",1,0,1444629819,1444716636
cvwo8go,0,t1_cvwmbw4,PerfectSociety,Unskilled labor was only valuable back then because companies had access to a limited labor supply since the technology that enables the modern (1970s to present) global workforce did not exist and trade policies favored domestic employment. Average tariff rates were around 30% on imports during the Gilded Age so the country was indeed very protectionist during this time. I'm not sure why you refute that. ,1,0,1444629525,1444716636
cvwdtgk,0,t1_cvw67ac,PerfectSociety,That's the point about income inequality. It's astounding to me that you do not get this. The poor do NOT have enough to live reasonably. That's why people care about income inequality. I wouldn't care about income inequality if the middle class had enough to live comfortably and the poor had enough to live reasonably. But they don't. ,1,0,1444608646,1444716636
cvwdadp,0,t1_cvw6v10,PerfectSociety,"Libertarians haven't gotten anything because libertarian ideas are not popular with the American people. I don't see libertarianism ever becoming popular. Most people want some amount of security in their lives and want a safety net. That's just how it is. I think such things are important to have. Libertarians disagree and conscious voters aren't going to support ideas that reduce their job security, reduce their retirement security, lower their standard of living, damage their opportunities to move up the economic ladder, destroy democracy, and create an unsustainable system that eventually collapses on its own top-heaviness.
