cvwxtdc,0,t1_cvw35th,N34TXS-BM,"Well here's the thing, both sides are right to an extent. At current mid GE prices, overloads are roughly 15k/dose all on their own. When you make holy overloads, you are getting two additional doses for 9.5k, reducing the cost to 12k/dose. When you make supreme overloads, you are playing 32k, raising the cost to 15.3k/dose.

The problem is that with herb prices still settling from dxpw, what's most cost effective today may not be tomorrow. Since the cost/dose of supremes is comparable to regular overloads, in any situation where you are fighting against something stronger than GWD bosses you should use supreme if you can boost to it. If you are in a slayer task, holy overloads are cost effective and allow you to use prayers to sustain yourself or speed up the task. ",1,0,1444660899,1444720585

cvw0ayx,0,t1_cvvm4qk,N34TXS-BM,"You need a better weapon, sell your Rune 2h on the GE and purchase an abyssal whip and bandos warshield. This will get you through almost all of your initial slayer tasks and will help you make some money quickly to round out your equipment. Once you have those, go see a slayer master, I recommend Chaeldar, in the Lost City (through the fairy ring), or Vannaka, in Edge Dungeon, if you don't have access to it.

Ok so in my opinion, your first priority once the money starts coming in should be raising your ranged level up to at least 70 via slayer/quests. With the adjusted combat triangle, range is the strongest method for many mid to high level bosses (QBD, solo nex, araxxor) and several moneymaking slayer tasks (black dragons, aquanites (farm xp), dark beasts).

After that, I'd set work towards 67 summoning, for war tortoise, and 70 prayer, for the piety prayers (with the range and mage variants). With those skills, you'll be able to go to God Wars Dungeon by yourself and get decent kills. With a bit of camping GWD, it can be a great way to finance your other goals until you have access to better methods.

After that, things are pretty open for you since you've got a mix of stats. If you're looking for a couple long term goal suggestions, here are a couple I see often recommended here:

83 Herblore so you can access QBD, which is an excellent way to make money and take your from mid level (GWD and QBD) to high level (Nex, Araxxor, RotS, Vorago etc).

Complete Plague's End Quest- get access to Prifdinas, the elf city which is home to many of the fastest xp rates in the game as well as the most useful content.

Complete Ritual of the Mahjarrat Quest - get access to the Jas boost for a 5% damage bonus in glacor caves as well GWD and Nex. You'll also have access to bane ore so you can make dragonbane arrows/bolts, which are the best weapons against QBD and can dramatically lower your kill time. There are also a couple other key unlockables along the way (curses, ancient magicks) to make combat easier as well.

99 Slayer, there isn't anything more satisfying in runescape than killing things, and that's what slayer is. It's a great money maker and fast xp because of the slayer helm, which can be upgraded in both damage and accuracy for some of the fastest boss kills in the game (black dragons -> QBD, kalphites -> Kalphite King/Queen, Greater Demons -> Kril (Zam GWD boss), etc).

Complete Brink of Extinction Quest - access to all of the Tzhaar training methods and equipment, such as obsidian armor and kiln capes, which are the strongest bonus in their individual stats for the cape slot. You also can have access to fight kiln, where with a half hour of easy work, you can earn yourself an uncut onyx, currently worth 2m.

Complete Lords of Vampirum Quest - access to good moneymaker and slayer task: vyrelords. They also give access to very strong weapons against them so you can quickly tear through them in 2-3 hits.

I highly recommend checking out a sign of item protection to have a fail safe to save the weapon if you go the warband route.
