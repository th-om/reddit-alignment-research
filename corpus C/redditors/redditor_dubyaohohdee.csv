cvv8nhp,1,t3_3o1z4i,dubyaohohdee,"33y/o.  Diagnosed ~3 months ago.  Went to my primary care doc and said ""I think i have ADD.""  He told me his office doesnt handle that and referred me to a Psychiatrist.  Called their office and they said they dont do diagnosis, only treatment and said go to a Psychologist 1st.  Went there took a bunch of tests (and didnt lie or anything) and they diagnosed me with ADD.  Went to Psychiatrist and they gave me a script.  Kind of a hassle, but nobody gave me any grief.

>'As needed' is how you start an addition

Are you implying ""as needed"" will equate to him taking more than prescribed b/c he ""needs it"" or will intermittent usage somehow reduce the likelihood of developing a dependence?",3,0,1444336859,1444731306

We have 2 of these DIY whiteboards in our house.  One in the kitchen with small corkboard glued over top of one of the corners so we can pin stuff to it and the rest is sectioned off into grids for meal/activity planning.  Shopping lists, notes etc.  ",1,0,1444233864,1444731306

I am undecided.  I dont have a problem with sub per se, I just need to see the terms and the features.  Hopefully it will be less expensive the longer you own or something.  ",5,0,1443895228,1444731306
