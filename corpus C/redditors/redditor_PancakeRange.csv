Therefore, they never needed many slaves (Northerners did have slaves). In the South, the land was great for huge plantations, where the plantation owners needed cheap labor, and got slaves. By the time the North industrialized, and could have used slaves on factories, the Northern states had already abolished slavery for a long time, and therefore wouldn't try to reintroduce it.
