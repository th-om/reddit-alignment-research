cvt6ybm,0,t1_cvt5b6r,mt_weather,"this was actually much worse. after the S&L crisis, a bunch of smart money managers were looking fora new way to make piles of money. they hit upon building a sewer system, with the reasoning that at any time they could halt construction or cause the sewers to malfunction, and then charge Jefferson County (and through the county, several cities which went bankrupt due to levies associated with construction) to ""repair"" their work.

The Wall Streeters involved bribed everyone who would be signing off on the key documents, and then spent 20 years ransoming the sewer system of Birmingham, Alabama (p. 650,00), eventually extracting over $3 Billion dollars.

> The Jefferson County sewer construction scandal encompasses $3.3 billion spent on repairs, upgrades and expansions of the Jefferson County sewer system, made in part to comply with a 1996 consent decree drafted to ensure future compliance with the federal Clean Water Act. A 2003 study found that much of the money was misspent, costing rate payers hundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary expenditures. Due to the project's enormous costs, county-wide sewer rates have increased markedly, from among the lowest in the country to the highest, and are projected to continue indefinitely in order to service outstanding debts.

> Furthermore, several county officials have been prosecuted for corruption in contracts related to sewer projects, and a series of increasingly-complicated interest rate swaps carried out by the County in efforts to reduce overall debt service have backfired, causing the filing of the largest municipal bankruptcy in U. S. history. 

and every time the county tried to fight back, the owners of the sewer bonds threatened to stop sewer service and pull up the sewer. Right wing economics at its best.",1,0,1444325918,1444717680
