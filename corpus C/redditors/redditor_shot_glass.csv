Your argument is like someone saying how good it worked out that Tampa was an ass to Bo Jackson so that they ended up continuing sucking so bad they could sell the team and then get Tony Dungy which allowed them to build a hall of fame defense and then fire Dungy to hire the guy that coached the team they end up playing in the superbowl who then doesn't restock the talent and leads them to get Schiano who gets rid of anything good left and ruin a promising young qb and then get a first round pick for Winston.
