These are supposed to be intelligent human beings and this is their response? Chicken-shit nonsense that only 'covers asses' instead of 'solves anything.'

cvtdyj0,1,t3_3o28v6,mccannta,"Get used to this type of headline. As Obama is ashamed of the leadership role America has in the world, we will, more frequently, be 're-acting' to the provocative actions of rogue nations stepping into the abdication/vacuum-as-foreign-policy, of which he is so proud. 

Too smart and wise for normal humans, Obama is just biding his time until the, of course, inevitable 'arc of history' proves him correct. Never mind that the world looks to America to lead and shape and project its power as a deterrent for invasions and chemical-weapons massacres and country annexing and soft-power invasions, et al. 

The Obama administration: months or years late to the party and always putting in the absolute minimum amount of energy possible. ",-4,0,1444365619,1444718586

cvt0413,1,t3_3o0971,mccannta,"**This is ridiculous and juvenile.** What we are seeing is the re-defining of ignorance and *'being a dick'* into a virtue, and using it to justify running for president. The goal within the arena of politics is not a contest of ideological purity, it is a battle to *govern effectively*. ""Is the point of elected office to get credit for fighting or for reviving the country?"" (WSJ today)

This logic is nihilistic insanity! Here is what you get from an electable conservative: a more economically- and politically-free society, a president that will lead and govern from a conservative standpoint, a government that support the rights of the individual instead of ephemeral group-rights, and hopefully a focus on devolving more power and responsibility to the states instead of the blunt federal government. 

What do you get with your frustration-laced tantrum toward 'the establishment?' The unsullied purity of your unintended but clearly obviously self-destructive consequences of your *anger* that results in a Hillary Clinton presidency.",0,0,1444341541,1444718586
