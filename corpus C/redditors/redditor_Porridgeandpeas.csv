cvv9o92,1,t3_3o9oyt,Porridgeandpeas,"My mother, had polio and a crappy childhood, she raised 11 successful children, was widowed and left with 6 boys at the age of 29. She has dealt with every problem she has, every issue we have all had and just takes it in her stride even when it's really bad. Looks after my CF suffering brother etc.. I'll not go on.

She still goes about her days as if she's the happiest, most giving woman in the world. What a Queen.

Thanks mum!",1,0,1444520302,1444720304
