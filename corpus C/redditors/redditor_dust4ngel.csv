cvx70j2,1,t3_3oe63q,dust4ngel,"I feel like ""what's a good way to explain calculus?"" is a solved question - there is no good reason to have edition 17 of such a text.  likewise, the events of the war of 1812 are probably not going to change much in the future.  there is so much information on these kinds of topics which is freely available - the idea of $400 textbooks to convey the same information is indefensible and only a possibility under a false monopoly.",1,0,1444675171,1444730462

cvw0j10,0,t1_cvvqona,dust4ngel,"> The state's role is to enforce boundaries on private power that prevent this from happening.

this arrangement assumes that the state is somehow independent of private power (especially: not an instrument of it).  but that assumption can only hold if private power does not accumulate to the point where public institutions can be captured - which unfortunately is the case today.

> The general compromise that philosophers like Locke and Rawls come to is that the private power of one person is OK so long as it does not infringe on the private power of another person.

...and that is why this position appears naive to me, because it essentially says, ""the private power of one is OK so long as it does not infringe on that of another - but should that situation arise, there will be nothing you can do and everything will have gone to hell.""  in other words, private power is ok so long as it is not powerful - which is to say, it is not ok.

this is why a mythology has evolved to address the obvious illegitimacy of obscene wealth disparities - e.g. trickle-down economics, ""job creators"", etc.  you don't need this kind of double-speak to dress up situations that are clearly moral and justified - the existence of this kind of false language is an admission that our present arrangement is illegitimate.",1,0,1444587156,1444730462

this also works the other way - as private power increases, expanding the scope of captured government becomes easier and more attractive.

> What is your idea of countering it?

i assume you are asking this question as a way of shutting me down, but the truth of my claim that our current attitudes about private ownership serve power (and were authored by power) is independent of my ability to put forward a compelling alternative system.",1,0,1444526995,1444730462

that being said, i think the dichotomy of ""you can allow unchecked private power to dominate people's lives, or allow an ultra-powerful state tyranny to dominate people's lives"" is a false one - clearly either outcome is unacceptable, and clearly there are other possible arrangements of human society.",1,0,1444526586,1444730462
cvv8inc,0,t1_cvv7zdu,dust4ngel,"> And if a region is in disarray, is people not acting truly voluntarily as big of a problem as the ""might makes right"" one? Also why would a disarray situation shed any light on what constitutes a good stable system if there is none to speak of there?

i am generally not able to make sense of what you have said, but i think what you're asking might be ""how does an analysis of obvious exploitation in cases of obvious power asymmetry shed light on cases of exploitation in the context of lesser power asymmetry?""  and i think the answer is that both scenarios are examples of might makes right, and these occur in developed nations such as the united states all the time.

as power and wealth concentrate into fewer hands, the power asymmetry which makes this kind of exploitation possible grows, and undermines the extent to which any exchange can be called ""voluntary"" in a meaningful sense.

> You cannot improve it without giving the govt the power to do more harm to people it doesn't like.

the government is not the only power to fear - as power accumulates in private hands, private interests are better able to capture the government and use it as their own instrument.  to the extent that this is true, you should fear the state, but only insofar as it becomes a weapon of private power.",1,0,1444518170,1444730462

i'm not sure what your argument is, but i acknowledge that this is how the world works - if you have a lot of wealth, you can just collect interest on it and not work a day in your life.  if you don't have a lot of wealth, you have to work, in exchange for wages which are largely a function of the circumstances of your birth.

cvv62d0,0,t1_cvv5ni7,dust4ngel,"> Not really, if you arrange a deal that you pay somebody to put things together for you ... this is as straightforward as it gets.

i don't doubt that this is straight-forward - the question is whether it's *legitimate.*  for example, if i go into a war-torn country where everything is in disarray and everyone is starving to death, i can get people to agree to pretty much anything.  two facts will hold for these arrangements:

* they are as straightforward as it gets
* they are brutal, completely indefensible exploitation

> The world with clearcut property rights is simpler than the one where every property claim can be challenged on a whim

this is true, but is not at odds with anything i've said.  property rights law being straight-forward is independent of whether they are legitimate.  you could have a straight-forward set of laws that favors arbitrary power and turns the world into a prison, or a straight-forward set of laws that generally elevates the quality of life for all mankind.",1,0,1444513603,1444730462
cvv4qr9,0,t1_cvv3sk4,dust4ngel,"> People tend to give a fuck about things that are ""theirs""

the scare quotes are the active part of that sentence for me.

even if you held property rights as the primary value of society, you can still debate over what constitutes legitimate ownership or legitimate claims to property - i.e. under what conditions something is ""yours.""

for example, if i own a company employing thousands of workers, i could claim that anything that they produce or imagine is mine (many companies do this).  say what you will, but this is a very different conception of property rights than, for example, ""whatever i build with my own hands is mine"" - and a much more difficult one to defend.

there are many situations where people lay claim to property in our society, the legitimacy of which is under debate - i.e. things you come to own through war, through exploitation of weaker people, through inheritance, etc.  as wealth becomes increasingly concentrated, the arguments of the legitimacy of these arrangements become less believable.",1,0,1444511100,1444730462
