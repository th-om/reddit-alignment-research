cvxcsmq,0,t1_cvxcoav,DarthGinger,"So say that Baylor is undefeated along with Utah, Ohio State, Clemson, and LSU at the end of the season. I think Baylor's weak OOC is plenty of reason to not put them in the playoffs.",0,0,1444683411,1444718122
cvxb0li,0,t1_cvx928w,DarthGinger,"> The way these threads always run, youd think every other top25 team plays Bama 4 times OOC

These are the Power 5 teams + Notre Dame in the Top 25 that have played at least one P5 / Notre Dame / BYU in their OOC:

* Ohio State played V Tech.
* TCU played Minnesota.
* Utah played Michigan.
* Clemson played Notre Dame and will play South Carolina.
* LSU played Syracuse.
* Michigan State played Oregon.
* Florida will play Florida State.
* Texas A&M played Arizona State.
* Alabama played Wisconsin.
* Florida State will play Florida.
* Michigan played Utah, Oregon State, and BYU
* Notre Dame played / will play Texas, USC, and Stanford in addition to their ACC opponents (including Clemson)
* Stanford played Northwestern and will play Notre Dame
* Iowa played Iowa State and Pittsburgh
* UCLA played Virginia and BYU
* Oklahoma played Tennessee
* Northwestern played Stanford and Duke
* Cal played Texas
* Duke played Northwestern

So out of the 22 P5 + ND teams in the top 25, 19 of them played at least one P5 team / ND / BYU in their OOC schedule. The only 3 that didn't are Baylor, Ole Miss, and Oklahoma State. Baylor is the only one in the top 10 that didn't.

They may not be the only one, but they are one of only three. And I'm sure the other two would get the exact same criticism.",1,0,1444680919,1444718122
cvx7ohj,0,t1_cvx7f7s,DarthGinger,"I wouldn't say that. If all the other conference champs are undefeated, I could easily see Baylor getting left out. Granted, it's really unlikely that each one of those teams goes undefeated. But, it could happen.",3,0,1444676134,1444718122
cvx76re,0,t1_cvx60lx,DarthGinger,"I'm ""hating"" because I acknowledge the fact that Baylor's schedule is one of the softest in the country, and it could prove to be a liability come December? I'm ""hating"" because you made a shitty comparison between Baylor's and Texas's SOS, and I called you out on it?

This, my friends, is why I will be rooting for every team that plays against Baylor for the rest of the season. Even Oklahoma. Not because I hate Baylor, but because Baylor fans act like children. They treat any ounce of criticism as a personal attack against them, even if that criticism is well deserved.

If you want to play with the big boys, act like one. If you want respect, earn it. Don't bitch and moan about how everyone is ""hating"" on you.",1,0,1444675422,1444718122
cvx6iqv,0,t1_cvx3674,DarthGinger,"Don't get me wrong. Going undefeated is always nice. But none of those teams would be impressive marquee wins. Oklahoma maybe, but Texas just demonstrated how they are overrated.

My point is that Utah going 12-0 is going to look more impressive because they have a non-conference win against a good Michigan team. Clemson going 12-0 is going to look more impressive because they beat Notre Dame. Florida going 12-0 is going to look more impressive because they will have beaten Florida State (same applies in reverse).

Baylor's non-conference schedule is going to hurt them when their resume starts getting compared to other teams. The Big 12 as a conference is not strong enough right now for Baylor to rely exclusively on conference wins. And if they lose a game, their chances of making the playoffs go down sharply. It's basically go undefeated or bust for Baylor.",2,0,1444674459,1444718122
cvx1kcq,0,t1_cvx044j,DarthGinger,"+1 for confirming that it is working. I ran heroics for several hours on Saturday, and strikes were repopulating almost instantly when people left.",1,0,1444667141,1444718122
cvwzu48,0,t1_cvwz5k1,DarthGinger,">  There is a difference between saying, ""you schedule bluebloods because they are more consistently good than other programs and increase the chances of having a quality non-con matchup""

I literally said this.

> If USC is 0-12 in a year your team played them, then they are a cupcake. If Rice 12-0 in the same year, then they are not.

Sure. But when was the last time USC had a record even close to 0-12? The answer is over five decades ago in 1957 when they went 1-9.

When was the last time Rice came close to 12-0? The answer is over six decades ago in 1949 when they went 10-1.

The bluebloods of college football are bluebloods for a reason. They didn't get the reputation and respect that they have by going 0-12 every year.

You took my comment a little too literally and out of context. I'll modify it by saying Ohio State, Michigan, and USC are far better non-conference opponents than SMU, Lamar, and Rice when trying to schedule games 5-10 years in advance.",7,0,1444664368,1444718122
cvwyuob,0,t1_cvwyd6s,DarthGinger,"> Go ahead and talk shit about Rice and SMU. Considering that Texas and TCU play them too, i find it a stretch to say were the only ones doing this.

TCU at least played another Power 5 team in Minnesota (4-2). Their non-conference slate wasn't great, but it wasn't as crappy as Baylor's.

And Texas's other two non-conference games were against Notre Dame and Cal, two top 25 teams. Texas's schedule was ranked among the toughest in the country, so don't you even start trying to claim ""Texas does it too!""

> Record and scoreboard or GTFO.

And if Baylor drops a game, or several other P5 teams finish unbeaten, they will be back of the line because their strength of schedule sucks.",9,0,1444662721,1444718122
cvwyewp,0,t1_cvwy0c5,DarthGinger,"> Most non-con games are scheduled 5-10 years out at this point. Baylor could schedule Ohio State, Michigan, USC, etc. on the hopes that the non-con matchup will be a good one.

This is true. But you're still playing Ohio State, Michigan, USC, or whoever. Those are big names, and those names carry respect. And more often than not, they are going to have at least a decent team. Even if you schedule a game against USC and they turn out to suck that year, you still beat USC. Few people are going to look at USC and say ""well, Baylor shouldn't have scheduled cupcakes.""

Ohio State, Michigan, and USC are far better non-conference opponents than SMU, Lamar, and Rice, even in the worst of years.",15,0,1444661962,1444718122
cvwy34m,0,t1_cvwxqe1,DarthGinger,"With their schedule, Baylor only gets one opportunity to make a statement: TCU. Maybe also against Oklahoma State, but that's about it. Nobody is going to be impressed by Baylor destroying SMU, Lamar, and Rice.",9,0,1444661382,1444718122
