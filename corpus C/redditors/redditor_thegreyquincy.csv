cvxb7pt,0,t1_cvx84i0,thegreyquincy,"Yeah I could see conservative play-calling when up by two scores or more, but not by less than one. Makes no sense. ",4,0,1444681189,1444723307
cvx7g9z,0,t1_cvx2ac2,thegreyquincy,"I remember those, and he was running good routes and looked open, but they also showed that the safeties were giving him priority so that had Carr thrown it to him the safety would have closed on it pretty quickly. ",1,0,1444675804,1444723307
cvx7eke,0,t1_cvwyihs,thegreyquincy,"I agree, though I would argue that the Denver D probably had their focus on him most of the game. Opened up Crabs a couple of times, though. Musgrave's play calling seemed so much more conservative this game than previous games and I'm not sure why. I can understand wanting to avoid the pass rush, but I'm pretty sure like 90% of the plays called in the 2nd and 3rd quarters were rushes. He's got to get out of this mentality that us being up by a few points means that we need to sit on it for the rest of the game. ",4,0,1444675735,1444723307

cvwf2de,0,t1_cvwduco,thegreyquincy,">That's not relevant.

You ask how many times he's won games for us, then say we're hardly ever in a position for him to win a game for us isn't relevant? If we're down by two TDs we aren't kicking a FG with 30 seconds left. We've just recently started losing by close margins where we can kick FGs to win.",2,0,1444611016,1444723307
cvwazac,0,t1_cvwayh6,thegreyquincy,Haven't done anything in the second half. It's like a completely different offense.,2,0,1444603476,1444723307
cvwauqj,0,t1_cvwasc2,thegreyquincy,Probably getting double-teamed by one of the best secondaries in the league. Just my guess.,5,0,1444603255,1444723307
