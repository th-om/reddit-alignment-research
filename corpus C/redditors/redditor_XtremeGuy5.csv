cvxukjy,1,t3_3ois7y,XtremeGuy5,WTF. I was there and didn't see this happening lol,2,0,1444712636,1444730244
cvx3ngm,0,t1_cvx344g,XtremeGuy5,"Click on the scene you wish to export. Click ""File"" and scroll to ""Export Audio."" Export it. Go into logic and find the file you just exported. Click it, and it will be imported into logic. Important to note that you can always do a four bar pattern and simply duplicate the imported file in logic and turn it into a 16-bar loop or whatever. Saves you a bit of time in Maschine. ",2,0,1444670316,1444730244
cvx32xs,1,t3_3ogme1,XtremeGuy5,"Absolutely no clue. I typically do all of my work in Maschine, then when I'm ready to finish my final edit I dump all the scenes into logic and arrange them to my satisfaction. Then I'm able to export the Logic file as an MP3 and can then put it on soundcloud etc. I've tried doing what you are and was never able to figure it out. ",2,0,1444669468,1444730244

cvrnj1x,0,t1_cvqrbnw,XtremeGuy5,"Honestly dude I was about to get mad at your comment about the antidepressants but you actually have very sound reasoning behind your stance, and I commend you for that. As someone who's been on them for a while now, I'll have to look into this with my doctor, however my prescription is still small and I have yet to see any need to increase the dose (it helps that I've had a lot of personal growth in the past couple months also.) I think part of the reason for not quitting them is due to my recent decision to quit weed (four weeks clean) and i didn't want depression to come rushing back full force as a result of quitting (that's what happened last time I quit.)

cvpz9b7,1,t3_3nn2fd,XtremeGuy5,Some of the comments at the bottom of this thread are absolutely ridiculous. What the hell is happening? ,5,0,1444132099,1444730244
cvp7nrz,1,t3_3nj13n,XtremeGuy5,"I quit smoking four weeks ago. Like many others have said, it made me lethargic and depressed (along with other factors that contributed to my use of weed.) I'm very glad I quit. Everyone should take breaks - weed is a very slippery slope, and it's very easy to allow it to become ingrained in your daily life. ",1,0,1444071963,1444730244
