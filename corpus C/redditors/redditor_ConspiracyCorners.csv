cvucidm,0,t1_cvu73y7,ConspiracyCorners,"My friend, I hope you remember you're the free press guy now saying...pretty much that we have a kinda free press manipulated for financial gain by the subjective morality of excessively wealthy people who control the government and media. You got me beat articulating that, but, before heading to the dangerous realm of religious philosophy, we are closer on this than I thought at the start. My bad for believing to the extent I do in God almighty and acting to move His Love forward in the world to the extent this sometimes soul-less sinner can, but, hey, assuming I'm wrong to believe in His objective reality (being a doubter at heart), I, very much like the news readers who aren't 'in on it' but seek a paycheck, at least have some sense of spiritual gratification or comfort in wishing for others without any forceful dominion over them to wish to conform to dictates of God's expressions defining moral righteousness. (I saw a debate where Ron Paul got booed for mentioning the Golden Rule in connection with foreign policy, but aetheist Jesse Ventura doesn't have a problem with that. Devout Christians worried militarism won't sustain their employment needs are the ones who booed, concerned that 'hearts and minds' wars wouldn't be championed. So--ever the doubter--I hope there *is* an objective morality/reality that favors the righteous, even the folks booing Ron Paul since I booed that detestable infomercial and I'm his biggest fan.) I *still* insist there is an over-arching, objective morality that has to apply universally to those pursuing a level-4 Aristotelian happiness (heaven) and wish those wealthy media manipulators following the money well when their hearse is pulling a U-Haul full of money because then the money will be following them. I am proud of not (altruistically or otherwise) seeking to displace God's dominion over others, even the media manipulators, but I will admit to thinking that their 'faltering in their sleep at night' might help them in the pursuit of happiness.",1,0,1444437887,1444726828

I'm not sure of Rand's plan even though I trust I'll be able to and hope you'll support it, but getting rid of the let's-invade-Syria yesterday & isn't it wonderful what Iraq-Libya-Afghanistan have done to employ people mentality is bound to be part of it.

cvu4f13,0,t1_cvu3tcu,ConspiracyCorners,"So they support a discreditably bad information dissemination system in which their businesses are shamefully involved for greed's sake. They tell kids knowledge is power and giggle that their suppression of knowledge is *real* power. I can buy into the notion of some hypocritical rich guys running media as part of bigger empires; just the idea of them having the Trillionaire Boys Club with ""different"" media outlets all on the same government page all the time is what's hard to figure. Seems like someone (especially rich guys unrestrained by the normal constraints of lesser folks) would rebel against such uniform conformity...",1,0,1444423522,1444726828
cvu3gj6,0,t1_cvu2p62,ConspiracyCorners,"Your analysis works up to a point, but, as newspaper after newspaper after newspaper has declined, they have as a group declined to publish what I'd suggest would have been more profitable albeit more controversial text. The trouble isn't simply that the wrong things pay more money; it's that the powerful only have media toys they own to be toys and their focus hopes for no mutual exclusivity between power and money, but what *seems* a media monolith tows a government-mandated line, money or no money. I am mystified that variety doesn't find its way into the media and, if these 7 or 8 ultra-rich fat cats are free and own media outlets, assuming you're right and I'm wrong, seems like they'd go off the reservation instead of towing the government line. Never minding their manipulation of everyone else, how are the rich and credentialed press owners so manipulated?",1,0,1444421990,1444726828
