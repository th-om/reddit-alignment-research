It would literally make no sense now to conquer a country like India when instead we could just trade with them. War would make us poorer, not richer. ",1,0,1444713257,1444728774
cvxdd4b,0,t1_cvx3cwg,aggie972,"I've read that it can depend on who you are. Not everyone responds the same way to salt. Apparently a minority of people can be ""sodium responders"", and cutting back on sodium intake can lower their blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure, and eating less salt makes it go lower, then you should eat less salt.",2,0,1444684223,1444728774

cvx049k,0,t1_cvwz06v,aggie972,"IMO, he did so to ""own it"". His opponents were calling it that to try and sell a negative message of it, and instead of defiantly insisting it always be called the ACA, he was like ""Yeah, this bill is pretty great, so I'm cool with my name being attached it"". Still though, given that his opponents came up with that name, I think supporters should refer to it as the ACA.",6,0,1444664830,1444728774
cvwwcgk,0,t1_cvwtwf0,aggie972,"This may not be super ethical, but you can read all the locked articles if you just highlight the headlines, right click, ""search google for..."" and then click on the news link. I read WSJ sometimes, but not enough to justify subscribing to it. The reporting is pretty good, but the opinion pages are definitely the Chamber of Commerce/pro business crowd.

cvwjqru,0,t1_cvw719d,aggie972,"I think of it this way: maybe the burden of proof is on the aspartame haters if you're talking about a formal debate, but if I'm just considering my health, I have to ask myself: do I NEED to drink diet coke? Is there any benefit to doing so whatsoever? Since the answer is no, I'd rather avoid it unless/until it can literally be proven that it has no negative effects whatsoever. I know in practice it's hard to prove a negative, but I don't need to drink diet coke, so why should I risk it?",1,0,1444619380,1444728774
