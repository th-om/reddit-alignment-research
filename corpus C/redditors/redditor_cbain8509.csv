They replied that they only ate the other tribe in the rain forest and they are animals, not people. ",-1,0,1444681647,1444730390

8 1/2 refers to his hat size which gave him mercury poisoning which is what drove him mad. Coincidentally, this is probably also why the hatter in Wonderland was also mad.

10/10 for sure. 

Land before time still gets referenced in my life 25 years after I first saw it. There's something to say about that. ",2,0,1444391759,1444730390

cvseso8,0,t1_cvs6q4y,cbain8509,"The policy differences between Clinton and Bernie, until recently when Clinton had started repositioning herself,  were very different. Clinton was in support of the TPP, keystone pipeline,  and Patriot act. Sanders is adamantly against all three. 

To vote for someone in anything other than their ability to effectively lead is not a great way to go about it. It's like saying: Trump would be the first outsider to become president:   Carson would be the first 7th day adventist, or Bernie would be the first Jewish president. These things hold my merit to how they would lead. Neither does a candidates sex. 

I am all for a female president, just not another Clinton who is going to support trade agreements which send even more US jobs overseas (NAFTA for bill and the TPP for Hillary, which until this morning Clinton was all for). 

As a Democrat and current Sanders supporter I'd be more for Kasich,  a Republican (sadly with no chance) who has a sound centrist track record of fiscally conservative policies. ",5,0,1444308841,1444730390
