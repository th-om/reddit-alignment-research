cvxk7wa,0,t1_cvxfu0q,Account115,"This makes sense given the nature of health care and insurance economics. Healthcare is an inelastic good (a necessity really) and benefits heavily from economies of scale. Insurance is just pooled risk and, in the case of health insurance, price negotiation.

The problem with our market is that pharmaceutical companies are predatory, many doctors offices run as many billable tests as they can come up with, and hospitals gouge people on costs for stays. Also, uninsured people have learned to use emergency care as primary care because it's all they've been able to get in the past and they won't pay the medical debt.

I'd like to see mutuals and co-ops come out on top but I'd prefer to have a state ran single-payer system in each state. The current quasi-private, quasi-public system bleeds money and produces unnecessary inefficiencies.",8,0,1444695116,1444725391
cvxhzl2,0,t1_cvxduwf,Account115,"It's common for rural areas that lose their economic base to slowly wither on the vine for decades. I grew up in one of many old railroad towns that lost its agriculture and railroad markets. The city is basically in geriatric care as the young move out and the old retire/pass. Much of the tax base is homesteads or abandoned, and the population is highly conservative though they are increasingly being forced to either accept high tax rates or suspend more and more services until eventually breaking points like this one are reached.",13,0,1444691464,1444725391
cvvz9oc,1,t3_3iwtel,Account115,"I think this a reductionist argument that arises from a faulty metaphor. A voter is not a good. The vote would be the good (within the logic of the metaphor) and the vote is both clearly rivalrous (divisible) and excluble. Everyone gets one vote and can use it only once. At that, an election does not have to be perfect to be effective.

Even looking past this, the public provision of services is a separate topic from the election of officials, since the methodology for determining a suitable mode of provision hinges on how to effectively, efficiently, and fairly  finance an deliver services, not how the elected body that makes the final decision is selected. 

Markets are only efficient where market conditions can be met. They are often less effective than public provision.",1,0,1444585180,1444725391
cvubvb8,1,t3_3o4p92,Account115,"I have jumped around a lot and still experiment with religions, so to speak. 

I started identifying as unitarian universalist because I don't really have any definite theology, just a general belief in some sort of god. I find uu provides an opened and nurturing community and allows me to not have to compromise my views. I also agree with the basic ethical framework of uu.

Beyond that, I'd say that it's okay to not know. I enjoy seeking. Read up and watch videos on different religions. See what makes sense to you.",1,0,1444436622,1444725391
cvkvhxh,0,t1_cvk7h55,Account115,"Gay marriage and abortion are legal nationwide because of Supreme Court rulings on equal protection and privacy, respectively. States try to subvert abortion by regulating it heavily enough to make it nearly impossible to operate clinics.

As for funding the judicial system, you can contact your state rep and state senator about that though I'd make sure you read up on the nuances of the policy. A lot of times they are only billed if they are found guilty at trial. Alternatively, the expense would have to be covered through county taxes. 

I do think that nearly every law should be subject to standard periodic review and revision, and require reauthorization to avoid expiration. There should be very few permanent laws (mostly just basic human rights protections should be permanent).",1,0,1443729155,1444725391
cvk5btv,0,t1_cvk4h3o,Account115,"It's not my page or anything. It's just a link.

As far as people voting on which laws to keep, some laws have sunset provisions which cause them to expire if they aren't renewed. In practice, laws are periodically reviewed and updated.

A other issue is that most laws and regulations are fairly technical. Public input isn't really super necessary when determining what an acceptable amount of parts per million of urine in drinking water should be. Scientists make those decisions. Congress doesn't even bother setting up most regulations. They let agencies do it based on a set of guidelines. If someone objects, they consider a change.",1,0,1443671068,1444725391
