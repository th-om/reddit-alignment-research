>an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.

The state forcing private owners to increase the cost of their product by adding labeling is exactly the opposite of how capitalism is supposed to work.

That brings up a whole side argument about how we don't live in a pure democracy or a capitalist society though...

The issue here is that there is an almost infinite amount of information you could put on a food product.  Such as:
 
* Don't like the Northern Highbush variety of blueberry?  Maybe all the varieties of every type of fruit that's in the the product should be on the label.  

* I hear aluminum is linked to alzheimers so we should put the metal type of every transport, harvesting, sorting and processing tool that was used on the product.  
* I hear that some farmers underpay their employees so we should list every farm that contributed to the product and the exact wage paid to each employee involved with the company. 
* Some farming practices cause runoff that might contaminate the fruit so we should list the practices of every farm NEAR the location where the product was produced and the sterilization process the farm used to remove potential runoff...

I could keep going with information we *could* put on product labels. The point is there just isn't room to put all information on a label without having each product cost more money than exists on earth.  There has to be some kind of criteria for what information the consumer needs to know.  So far, those criteria do not require GMO labeling.  So far, anti-GMO groups have failed to give a reason why GMOs should be labeled.",1,0,1444056085,1444730729

cvj7g46,0,t1_cvj15mg,ruinmaker,"I want to pick at your perception of how women are portrayed in film because I think you may be the victim of some unconscious bias here.  We can all point to a strong female character from a movie, I'm sure. However, the majority of movies don't have one and we've come to *expect* that to be the case. So the exceptions make us feel as though there are more than there really are.  When commenting on research done on the topic [this article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/20-mustknow-facts-about-g_b_5869564.html) summarizes pretty well: 
>One form that sexism takes, including vis-a-vis media, is that people overestimate the presence of women and their speech. It happens everywhere. It's not that we think women are necessarily apparent or speaking as much as men, but that we expect them to be, relatively speaking, invisible and not speaking, so, by comparison, any appearance and speech is ""too much.""

I'll stick with that article since it does a decent job of summarizing overall statistics of the portrayal of women in film.  More specifically to your comment:
> Women in film and TV shows are almost universally more competent than their male counterparts

I dunno about how competent they are when they're portrayed but the man is three times more likely to be the lead, and movies are running 2.4 on screen men for every woman (the US is 3.4). They're portrayed in STEM fields about 14% of the time whereas (in the US) women are 24% of the STEM workforce. The men are pretty likely to solve problems through brute force rather than careful thought. That doesn't change the inherent sexism that movies tend to be about men and populated by men.

> and attractive to boot

Here's where the meat is.  Not only do women not appear in film as often as men (and have fewer major roles), the women that *are* portrayed in film are more than twice as likely to be skinny, twice as likely to wear sexy clothing, twice as likely to take off those clothes and 5 times as likely to have their appearance commented on. Again, we have bias - based on gender - for the kinds of roles women do play. Your comment alone - that women on film tend to be attractive - points to that sexism.
