cv6gidc,0,t1_cv6c36l,Demosthenes_lives,I made the qualification to show the difference between a legitimate member of the press and just your normal corporation. There are certain rights that the government has to give the press that should not be given to every corporation out there. This includes given limitless amounts of money to a political party in the form of super PACS. Things like Citizens United in combination with current campaign finance laws are what make this possible. ,1,0,1442621287,1444727099
cv6g7mm,0,t1_cv6c0se,Demosthenes_lives,Yeah you cant donate to individuals but donating to parties after primary candidates are chosen is pretty much the same thing. ,1,0,1442620673,1444727099

cv62rf9,0,t1_cv62dlb,Demosthenes_lives,"The post is a press organization, therefore they have inherited guaranteed rights as a press organization, not as a corporation. Citizens United on the other hand said that ALL corporations regardless of cause or service have constitutional rights. ",0,0,1442597893,1444727099
cv620jl,0,t1_cv61vkw,Demosthenes_lives,I already said in the first part that I think newspapers should be able to write about who they want to. I just draw the line at politicians accepting millions of dollars in soft money from any one corporation. It's more a matter of campaign finance reform than anything. ,0,0,1442596768,1444727099

cv61e3g,1,t3_3lflkp,Demosthenes_lives,If a newspaper writes about a candidate and backs them in that way I see no problem with that whatsoever. That's very plainly a right in the constitution. My problem with the Citizens United case is that these people were providing near unlimited supplies of soft money to endorse a candidate either directly or indirectly. The only reason they are able to do this is because the Supreme Court decided that corporations should have constitutional rights. That's ridiculous. ,0,0,1442595808,1444727099
cv6148q,1,t3_3lg6b1,Demosthenes_lives,"Ted Cruz, Huckabee, and regrettably Christie. Coming from a fairly religious person Cruz and Huckabee (and kinda Jindal) have all rubbed me the wrong way when it comes to social issues. I used to be a Christie fan until I heard all of his views on government surveillance.

I could live with Carson or Fiorina and I pretty much like everyone else even though Rubio is kinda quirky when it comes to Cuba. ",1,0,1442595392,1444727099
