He was also the only Republican in Congress (he switched to a Democrat later) to vote against the War on Iraq.",1,1,1444703624,1444716853

Hillary will spit out the same focus-group-tested soundbites and generally avoid answering questions. Nobody will really outright attack her, and this will reflect well on the Republicans. She will more or less maintain her standing in the polls, might drop a few percent, but nothing major.

Bernie will repeat the same anti-wealthy lines and will answer most questions well. He'll see a tiny bump in the polls, but will gain name recognition which is more important now.  He only knows one song, and he'll keep singing it.

O'Malley will see a decent bump in the polls up to around 4 or 5%. He will call for more debates and tout his record in Maryland (which should be really appealing to liberals, but somehow hasn't caught on).

Jim Webb will get one nice line and that's it. He will suspend his campaign in November or December.

Lincoln Chafee will get to mention the metric system and not much else. He will drop out in the following 2 weeks.

Larry Lessig (if he's in the debate) will come across as narrow-minded and flat compared to Bernie. He shouldn't've run to begin with, but he won't drop out soon.

Joe Biden won't run, and therefore will not be in the debate.",14,0,1444665270,1444716853

cvwgd8a,1,t3_3obi2n,MrIvysaur,"crunxx is right.  The spot adjacent to the Barring Crater and the river is the best spot.

After you settle there, consolidate your territory by founding a city one spot southwest from where your settler currently is.

However, I also should address how bad your scouting is north of Madrid.  You should've scouted the coastline a little bit.  There shouldn't be fog clouds 4 tiles away from your capital by the time you get your first settler out.",1,0,1444613383,1444716853
