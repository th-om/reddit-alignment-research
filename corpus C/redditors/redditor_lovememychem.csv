I misinterpret things all the time, and I've asked out/flirted with many girls that weren't interested, but unless you're so unbelievably oblivious or such an asshole that you have literally no ability to tell if a person is comfortable or uncomfortable, especially if they tell you to stop, you won't be labeled a creep. For all the complaining Reddit does about victim complexes, it has a pretty fucking strong one.",2,0,1444064971,1444718338

Genuinely asking those who know, because I'm not in the field -- does that mean anything?",2,0,1442730932,1444718338
