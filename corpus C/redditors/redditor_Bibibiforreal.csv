cvxfzr1,0,t1_cvxdski,Bibibiforreal,"Good for you! I know how hard and painful it is to imagine a future so different for your child than what you planned. Please know, for what it's worth, that we don't believe now that our son will ever ever need to use it.   We always made that the goal even when it seemed impossible, but planned for any eventuality. 

My son is a junior in college at a university across the country (with an excellent ASD support program). He's studying civil engineering, has a 3.5, drives, has tons of both NT and ASD friends, even a girlfriend. I feel like we sent a precicious 14 year old to university. He's 21, his psychiatrists now feel like he'll mature to about 16 or so in emotional intelligence.   He didn't potty train or begin to communicate effectively at all until about he was about 5 and we did so much therapy it's all one long blur. He wasn't even close to a ""we're not sure"" case, he was, and is and always will be, textbook autistic.

But now he's so happy, and has come so far- so it's all been worth it, and while I think he'll always need someone to check on him from time to time, he'll be all right.  I've underestimated him far far too many times before to know what to think. :) We just keep encouraging him to reach whatever goals he wants. I am grateful millenials have made it socially acceptable to live at home and stay a kid a bit longer before drowning in the rat race. 

You just never know where your little guy will end up along his journey but take heart--there is so much reason for hope.  Well done, you did a good thing today to keep your little one safe. ",2,0,1444688254,1444729537

cvx8yld,0,t1_cvwxdm4,Bibibiforreal,"Yeah, except ADHD meds are stimulants, which will immediately calm someone who really has it, and allow them to focus.  For someone who is neurotypical, stimulants will, well, stimulate them like mild cocaine.  Why do you think college students love to buy Adderall? ",1,0,1444677992,1444729537
cvx8jj2,0,t1_cvx4627,Bibibiforreal,"Funny how autism was once thought to be a lack of empathy, yet I've rarely seen such a lack of empathy as Reddit's attitude toward autism.  Yeesh. 

I wish you and your little guy all the best.  I remember those early days in the trenches  like yesterday.  Virtual hugs. My son's given me the okay to talk about his experiences- When he was dx'ed and we were advised to sign up for a group home early, I went out and bought a computer to see if ""that world wide web thing"" everyone was talking about had any info. I'd heard there were these things called ""chat rooms"" and ""message boards"" that were like real time email groups where you could talk to people from all over.  I used to crave hearing from adults with autism and/or their parents, feel free to PM me if you ever wanna chat. Yay for the internet. ",2,0,1444677382,1444729537
cvwy7jg,1,t3_3og2l6,Bibibiforreal,"My husband is of Middle Eastern decent and grew a beard once. His parents and I made him shave before we had to fly. Come on, dude. ",0,0,1444661604,1444729537
cvwxzbm,0,t1_cvwx4vf,Bibibiforreal,"Wow, they can't grieve their expectations and process them so they can be the best support possible for their child?  They can't feel pangs of hurt to see their child struggle over the years? Especially when the road for help is still such an overwhelming struggle and extemely time-consuming and horrendously expensive? 

I would never wish my son normal- he wouldn't be him if he was. He would never wish it either, he loves who he is and knows no other normal. 

But if I could take away the years and years of pain and misery for him and us when he couldn't communicate and screamed all day, when his skin hurt to every touch, when he couldn't eat due to sensory issues---if I could take away the meds that made him suicidal, if I could take away the bullying and teasing he experienced, I would in a heartbeat.  

And I absolutely refuse to feel guilty about any grief over watching him struggle. I still have a little cry when he struggles. I probably always will.  I don't apologize for one second over having to process the grief we felt for the other children we couldn't have, and the grandchildren we probably won't ever have.  I have a right to my feelings. 

I have given everything for my child and I will do so forever.  Don't you dare judge me unless you have walked the 20 year marathon we have been on helping our son have a good quality of life.  How dare you. ",8,0,1444661196,1444729537

cvwdper,0,t1_cvw8zty,Bibibiforreal,"Honestly, I still think she made the right decision- the same thing happened to almost everyone else in 2008, and wages haven't increased for pretty much anyone in 15 years. 

Not sure she'd be too far off if she'd sacrificed the time with her children and worked her whole life only to probably be laid off in 2001, and then again in 2008 like she was and all the rest of us.  She'd probably be in the same position or similar, unfortunately.  ",4,0,1444608426,1444729537
