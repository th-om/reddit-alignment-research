No, seriously.  Try and think of **anything** she's ever said that was remotely of value.  She's a wannabe shock jock who only cares about one thing, bringng publicity for herself.  The sooner people realize that and stop paying attention to her the sooner we can all stop hearing her crap.",3,0,1444716430,1444719541
