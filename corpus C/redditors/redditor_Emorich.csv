I suppose to be fair it still doesn't actually have to be religious based, but if you're right it seems unlikely it was actually because they thought it was a bomb. Is there any word on how he was treated while in custody? Maybe the police had their hands tied by some local law. ",1,0,1442613795,1444731240
cv6axcb,1,t3_3lgach,Emorich,"Do we actually know the arrest was due to him being Muslim? I haven't really been following the story, but when I first heard about this story it sounded like another case of zero tolerance being taken to ridiculous extremes. I'm thinking here of the kids who are expelled for making finger guns at one another. Was there a slur or something? Or are we all just assuming it's the case because it just seems likely?",-2,0,1442610763,1444731240

I also had no idea that Reddit had only a single personality that apparently obsessed with jury nullification, even though it fits perfectly into this situation.",1,0,1441926423,1444731240
