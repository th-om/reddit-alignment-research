cvcq46l,0,t1_cvcfnw7,AngelusMortis729,"Again no one will compare it that way. Your the only one who seems to compare it Bush vs Clinton. Everyone will compare it as Jeb vs Hillary. But only if it's those two head to head. The legacy won't matterin that case and both Hillary and Jeb will distance themselves from their last name and try to stand on their own merits.  And most will judge them on those merits,  not their last name. ",1,0,1443113327,1444724924
cvc4zjh,0,t1_cvc4hwf,AngelusMortis729,"When its Bush vs Clinton neither candidate can use the past as an attack they both come from dynasties. Saying we dont need another Bush isnt an effective attack coming from a Clinton and vice versa. Also voters not going to vote based on wether was Bill or George worse. Theyre going to evaluate Jeb and Hillary on their own merits. And in that regard Jeb has it easier actually. He hasnt been in the public spotlight as long as Hillary and less people know him and his record than they know Hillary. She's been a national figure for a long time. So objectively speaking your wrong. Clinton, Bush the names wont matter in that match up. What will matter is how they stand out as candidates.",-2,0,1443061722,1444724924

cv8rgpt,1,t3_3lrfo4,AngelusMortis729,"What the op stated are the reasons I believe the Republicans are hoping the Democrats elect Hillary. They will have a field day with her. Of course depending on who they elect the Democrats could have a field day with there chosen candidate as well ie: looking at you Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, Donald Trump, and others.

I think Bernie inspires more fear in Republicans than Hillary does. They view her as a get out of jail free card after all their messes, from the dog house straight to the presidency.

Obviously thats perception we will have to wait and see how things really play out. But my bold prediction is if Bush or Rubio get out of the primaries they will roll over her. 

Just my opinion dont down vote me plz...

Edit: For clarity am an independent and pretty all over the place, would vote for Bernie over Hillary in Primaries, but unless Biden gets in The Democrats will probably lose my vote this election.",1,0,1442814172,1444724924
ctzba7k,1,t3_3glmvq,AngelusMortis729,"I like this idea. As far as the senators go, change there terms as well and congress for that matter. We need an overhaul of our political system.

 When your running for re-election so quick after being elected it makes your entire job focus on winning elections. Instead of governing, or legislating.",1,0,1439312026,1444724924
