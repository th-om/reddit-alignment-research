cvvppwu,1,t3_3oartg,lmaoo-sure,"Given that Republicans control both the House and the senate, while also holding the governorship and local governments of numerous states, I wouldn't say the country hates the Republican party. Its very troubling when someone starts to project their own biases onto the rest of society despite evidence to the contrary.

The Republican party is definitely struggling on the *national* level. They're looking at 8 more years of a Democratic administration if they don't get an establishment candidate to #1 in the polls before the primaries. Donald Trump is popular but he also has high unfavorables. Given that he's a moderate Republican, he's a high risk, high reward candidate when it comes to remodeling the party's image. Carson would not stand a chance against Hillary in the general. Carly Fiorina's got the best chance against Hillary, and her performance in the last GOP debate might actually result in a surge for her in the polls.

Remember, Republicans got serious about making an outreach to minorities and softening their tone on social issues before Trump came along. Rand focused on criminal justice reform, going as far as teaming up with Democrat Cory Booker. Jeb is ""soft on immigration"" (*Trump voice*), and is married to a Hispanic woman. Had Trump not stepped in, the Republican party would be in the middle of a serious makeover right now.

Existentially, the schism between the establishment and the Tea Party is a bigger threat to the party. The Republican establishment is going to have to to a better job of communicating to the base, without tossing their thoughts and concerns to the wayside, that the Tea Party has not been effective in advancing the conservative agenda. They're also going to have to stop promising to do things like repeal Obamacare and all the other unrealistic nonsense that lets demagogues on the right (*cough* Ted Cruz *cough*) take advantage of their party's bluff by calling them on it when they win the elections. This is not an impossible task. The younger generation will drag the GOP to modernity and sanity soon enough. There's a significant enough block of millennials that dislike socialism, PC culture, feminism, etc. that they see as being represented by the left, while also being pro gay marriage and pro secularism that makes it worth while for the GOP to change it's message.

The Republican party risks losing its relevance on the national stage, but with its largest majority in Congress since the 1920's and the success of various Republican governors, its far from going extinct or being hated by most Americans.",2,0,1444562789,1444716763
cvvnsn1,1,t3_3oabhj,lmaoo-sure,"A couple points:

- What you're proposing is that we completely ignore the political process and instead make it so certain types of Republicans, not matter how popular their ideas are with the party base, are never represented in government. That's *extremely* corrupt. By the same token you could redistrict and make sure progressives never get into office. Then we'd only have establishment politicians, which a significant portion of the country is not fond of.

- The discrepancy between what the Republican establishment promises its base (defund Obamacare, do away with Obama's immigration policies, end gay marriage *somehow*) and what they actually do (passively enable all of Obama's policies) is always going to exist, which means the Tea Party will always exist. And sure, you can somehow prevent the Tea Party from putting their own people into office, which just means more people will be disenfranchised from the political system. ",5,0,1444554027,1444716763

cvpjtr9,1,t3_3nn22i,lmaoo-sure,"1) People realize access to guns is not the problem, its only the symptom. The fact that there's no real attempt to provide better mental health care for troubled young men means the only thing more gun control would accomplish is make it harder for responsible people to acquire guns.

2) Gun control has been largely ineffective in stopping crime. Chicago has some of the harshest gun laws in the country and still has a huge gun violence problem. In their case the problem is cultural (gang culture born out of necessity) rather than just an issue of mental health. The guns are either acquired legally, taken from a family member, or acquired illegally. The last shooter had a hand gun and apparently no prior criminal or mental health history. 

3) Gun rights are now seen as individual rights. Much like freedom of speech and freedom of religion, the right to bear arms is seen as indispensable and any attempt to infringe upon it in any way (even for the ""greater good"") is seen as unamerican. 

4) Its seen as a political ploy by Democrats. The conservatives I follow online have memed (not sure if its the right word) the idea that politicians who are guarded by armed security personal are trying to tell us who can have which guns. Its seen as hypocrisy. I'm not sure about the validity of the argument, but nonetheless it sticks.",13,0,1444091539,1444716763
