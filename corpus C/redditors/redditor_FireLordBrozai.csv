>Apply this same obvious logic to a scenario where you have 2 girls of equal attractiveness, one of which has had sex with 5 guys, the other of which has had sex with 10. When taking into account their ""mileage"" from an objective standpoint (which is highly offensive to some) the one who has had sex with fewer guys has a lower supply(of sex offered to the market of human romantic interactions) for the exact same demand(perceived physical attractiveness), meaning they have a lower value in terms of social-sexual economics.",6,0,1442245019,1444728448
