cvxpuwk,1,t3_3oj7if,PeterGibbons2,"No major gaffes to be played in the news cycle for the next few weeks. That's really all she needs to do to ""win"" for her playbook because I expect no major risks on her part. 

She'll have some canned answers and it will be fairly uneventful. You won't see any clips of hers going viral unless they're a gaffe. Clinton isn't looking to throw any hail mary's let alone throw first downs. 

I think Bernie has to go negative and try to knock her off her rehearsed answers and make her look rude and dismissive like Obama did. Anything else is a ""win"" for Clinton because she will be playing it very safe and to the vest. Almost by default I expect Bernie to ""win"" the debate because Clinton will be playing not to lose. 

One more thing: I predict this debate will have a very different tone than the GOP primary. Expect it to be much more cordial with Clinton even complimenting Sanders at times and agreeing with him and not trying to look smarmy or smug. What she will be trying to do is establish a tone of positivity and enthusiasm within the base and the independents at home. I think this thing is going to end up feeling more like a DNC pep rally aimed at differentiating themselves from the GOP than a contentious debate. Clinton's strongest ""shots"" at the night won't be aimed at Sanders but at the GOP.

In what ways is Hillary ""anti-student?""

Matt Richardson, David Ciciline, Pete Gallego, Mike Honda, Sheila Jackson Lee, Jan Schakowsky and Mark Takano are all the leaders within the caucus that have pledged support to Clinton.

cvwuczl,1,t3_3ofy50,PeterGibbons2,"Clinton is focusing a lot of her effort on the south in her ""southern firewall"" strategy. With the increased amount of minority voters in those states, she will likely sweep SC on February 27 and then Alabama, Arkansas, George, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia on March 1. The race will be probably be close to over by super Tuesday if Bernie doesn't start polling better in the south. ",89,0,1444653099,1444721751

cvsiclr,1,t3_3nyul1,PeterGibbons2,"I used to do debate in high school and made it to nationals. I assume the format they were using was similar to public forum opposed to policy (the auctioneer style of debating). 

Honestly almost anyone can debate if you have good research and anyone can lose if you don't. Debate is all about preparation and research. If you lack the proper counter evidence, you will lose because no matter of rhetorical wit or innate intelligence can save you against a well-prepared argument. 

So that leads me to think that the inmates were better prepared and if it means anything, it means that many inmates are capable of learning and researching and we should continue to focus on our efforts to improving their access to rehabilitative and educational resources to harness their potential and to make productive use of their time.

cvrcon6,0,t1_cvr9q3e,PeterGibbons2,"I would definitely disagree with the term jaded. In fact I'd call it full fledged optimism bordering on blind delusion. This community is reminiscent of the Romney campaign rejecting all polling and major statistics saying they were going to lose and still buying tens of thousands of dollars in fireworks. I mean just look at this comment yesterday:

[On winning the election:](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3nn1bs/new_bernie_sanders_polls_show_he_could_win_he/cvpmudf)

>He can and he will.

>It's been done before.

>Looking forward to the debates.

So a majority of /r/politics posters are convinced this guy is going to actually win the general when all major polling shows us currently that is very unlikely. 

This site is plastered in this blind optimism every day. It's hardly a jaded community. And I wouldn't call people chiming in with facts and bringing people back into the fold of reality jaded or cynical but merely cautiously skeptical. ",49,0,1444231944,1444721751
