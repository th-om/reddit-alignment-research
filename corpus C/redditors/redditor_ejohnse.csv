cvsq3fh,0,t1_cvsp69n,ejohnse,"You're welcome.  In Des Moines, I'm partial to Americana for bloody mary's and brunch... But it's pricey and more upscale.  Mullets is a great bar with good bloody mary's and decent food, but can occasionally be packed on weekends.  Everyone recommends Zombie Burger and Fong's (to the point that it almost appears we only have two restaurants), but I feel like there are better places, personally... Unless you absolutely need to eat a $12 burger.  I went to college at ISU, but don't really have too many good bloody mary recommendations in Ames.  I am partial to Chinese Homestyle Cooking on Lincoln way.  ",9,0,1444326871,1444722703
cvsp333,1,t3_3nzsjk,ejohnse,"What time are you leaving?  It'd be helpful to know which city you will be near during lunch.  Iowa is a broad state!  Also, if you go through Des Moines or Cedar Rapids, watch out for speed cameras.  If you go 10+ over the speed limit, you'll get a ticket.  Some other out of state dude was just complaining on /r/desmoines that he got a camera ticket and how much Iowa sucked because he got busted speeding.  Either way, have a good trip.",10,0,1444325401,1444722703

cvijvst,0,t1_cvihuuk,ejohnse,"I know you're sad now, but there will come a day when stop playing each other due to the conference imploding.  Let's just enjoy the time we have together, even if we both suck.  It's been fun playing you guys for the last 100 years.  P.S. - squeak floor season is almost here.",17,0,1443561087,1444722703
cvi3rcy,0,t1_cvhd4hy,ejohnse,"Just FYI, manufacturing makes up 15% of Kansas GDP, as opposed to 6.4% for primary agriculture.  Kansas is hardly speckled with manufacturing.  Manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade, finance/insurance, real estate, health care, and government employment all contribute more to Kansas GDP than primary agriculture.

cvh2oxs,0,t1_cvgylm8,ejohnse,"Alright, bear with me here, but that was in the new big12 era, not the old big12.  Perhaps if the league had never broken apart, OSU wouldn't have played ISU in 2011, since they were in the south division and we were in the north.  I'm pretty sure that upset wasn't OUR fault.  It was due to realignment and no longer having 2 divisions.  So really that loss is Texas fault.  (Am I doing this right?)",5,0,1443461036,1444722703
