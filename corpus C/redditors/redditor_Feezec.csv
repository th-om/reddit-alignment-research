cvwvit2,0,t1_cvwv26c,Feezec,This is 40k. Those species have probably mutated into unspeakable monstrosities and lurk in the bowels of the hive cities waiting to devour unlucky passing humans. The ones that didn't mutate were probably hunted to extinction by starving hive dwellers.,1,1,1444656191,1444732218
cvw0p92,1,t3_3ocm9n,Feezec,"I really enjoyed it. A little cheesy and exposition heavy at the beginning, but the characters are fun, the world is fascinating, and the classic butcher plot pacing grabs you and does not let go. I'm really excited for book 2 (still more excited for peace talks though)

I found my self mentally comparing it to ""on basilisk station"" by David Webber, and windlass came out far ahead. This is especially true for the ending naval combat scene, which balanced explanation and suspense much better than the climactic battle in basilisk.",7,0,1444587427,1444732218
cvvyjvf,0,t1_cvvxyo5,Feezec,"Divine mandates aside, how does the inquisition enforce its authority? The other high lords of terra control armies, fleets, psykers, bureaucrats, assassins, etc that give them independent bases of power for leveraging influence, but inquisitors just have fancy badges to back up their orders.",6,0,1444584027,1444732218
cvvw29y,0,t1_cvv6igb,Feezec,What's he doing now that he's retiring? Moving to a different game? Living on savings? How much money did he make playing lol? Is he leaving lol entirely or just the competitive scene?,2,0,1444579624,1444732218
cvtwet4,1,t3_3o3sef,Feezec,"Not much larger actually. Mario is basically the entire military of the mushroom kingdom, so they can't afford to occupy conquered territory in the long term. Plus their head of state is constantly distracted with frivolous aristocratic hobbies like go karting, golf, tennis, being kidnapped, whatever the fuck Mario party is, etc. this prevents the mushroom kingdom from developing a strong centralized administration or clear government policies. In reality the citizens of the mushroom kingdom mostly rule themselves while giving lip service to whatever conqueror came rampaging through most recently. You know how you always lower bowsers flag at the end of every level? He'll be back in a few days to put it back. A funny side effect of the endless war is that people are constantly fleeing and settling in new lands to get away from all the fighting and Mario-parties. This is why you find mushroom kingdom denizens living in all kinds of diverse remote locales like the desert, the sky, under water, and outer space--all of which quickly become new battlefields for the war that those refugees were fleeing in the first place, which generates more refugees... Etc etc",30,0,1444411441,1444732218

cvp2zlx,0,t1_cvoxbxq,Feezec,Binary systems will probably get patched in later. Pdox is likely already worried about scope creep as things stand,9,0,1444064999,1444732218
