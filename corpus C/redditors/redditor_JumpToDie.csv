I guess I can use machine translator, I doubt it will make any since to me dou, since machine translator aren't the best, and I guess these books are also written in another era, with another kind of language then the modern German language.",2,0,1443636780,1444722185

Any source about Hitler being an political intelligence agent?",2,0,1443633531,1444722185
cviaukm,0,t1_cviadjl,JumpToDie,"Fascism has nothing to do with the left/right wing label. 

Here in Sweden we have a party that's called The left-wing party(Feminism and strong Socialism) and well, they have right out said that the Sweden Democrats and ""borgare""(capitalists and liberals) had it coming when leftis are mistreating them.  

So you can't really say they were right wing simply because of their strong Fascism spirit. ",0,0,1443548373,1444722185

Also keep in mind that the game is still in alpha/beta, not everything is done. Maybe they will add more types of ammo and balista woulden't be able to use the same type as catapult?",2,0,1442677133,1444722185

csekjjq,0,t1_cse3kjj,JumpToDie,"Well yes, if you need more ""power"" then your power supply can give out for you, your computer will shut itself down(So i believe, have never happend to me before).
 
So i understand, you have a stock cooler on your CPU? Can be that it's not sitting right on top on your CPU. I could wigle my setup for a bit at one time, and well after i fixed it I went down around 5-10 C. My tip would be try to find a water cooling system that the store offer to take back after 30 days if you aren't happy. If your CPU overheats still after that, well there is a problem with your motherboard outputing the temperatures. 

Also maybe ask the guys to take a look at your computer? Can be one of those that did something to it... 


There can be many reasons for it. It can be that you have harmed your motherboard during installation. ",2,0,1434958710,1444722185
