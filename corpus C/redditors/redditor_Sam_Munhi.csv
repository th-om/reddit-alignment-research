Not living can't suck. Not living is, by definition, something a human can't experience. Up to a certain point a fetus is at or below the level of someone like Teri Schiavo when it comes to being ""alive"". I think the needs of men and women who are currently alive are much more important than whatever the fetus ""experiences"" in that state. 

[For reference, a fetus 24 weeks old or less does not have the ability to feel pain.](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19089-24-week-fetuses-cannot-feel-pain/) Other sources put the limit closer to 28 weeks. We're talking about a half-formed organism that can't survive on its own. It can't think, it has no personality, no experiences. 

It's a step on the way, to be sure. Short of saving the mother's life I don't think abortion should be performed past a certain date. But if you are going to define human life it needs to include real human brain function, or else we're just talking about a sack of cells.",1,1,1444714265,1444718414

No one cares about your sympathy, some of us want to live in a world where having sex isn't associated with punishment. I don't believe a clump of cells is human life. I care about the people who are alive today, and I want them to be able to maximize their happiness, whether that involves having kids or not.",2,0,1444684346,1444718414

However, to say the civilian deaths caused by drones are on the same level as the civilian deaths caused by the invasion and occupation of Iraq just isn't true. You have every right to believe that any life taken by the US military is one too many but not everyone will agree with you. That doesn't necessarily mean they don't have consistent principles, they might just honestly not agree with you.",6,0,1444679454,1444718414

Now, saying this, I actually agreed with Gulf War I and the Afghanistan invasion (the latter which I think even Gore would have done following 9/11). How we handled the aftermath of each is another story.",17,0,1444677968,1444718414
cvx67ki,0,t1_cvx60ei,Sam_Munhi,"Don't you think it's possible that a young couple gets married, gets pregnant without meaning to, gets an abortion, then has kids later? Cause that shit happens all the time. Family planning shouldn't be a dirty term of shame. Having the ability to choose when to have kids is a whole lot better for the parents and the child. Why are you willing to sacrifice IVF ""life"" for a greater good but aren't willing to sacrifice a too soon pregnancy for someone who will want kids later in life? Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating abortion as the primary means of birth control, but mistakes do happen.",2,0,1444674018,1444718414
