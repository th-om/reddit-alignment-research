cvdf9zw,0,t1_cvddfdk,Mdayofearth,"Health cares costs are high in this country because it's a capitalist economy. Health care companies, along with insurance companies, are natural monopolies and compete less than AT&T and Verizon. They may not collude to keep prices high, but they can keep raising the prices regardless of what other facilities are charging. Hospitals literally make up the ""cost"" of their services even when a general database of costs for well defined goods and services exists. There is no real law in place that says they cannot charge more than you can afford for their services.

The only way to reduce health care costs is more regulation, which is contrary to conservative ideals of small government, that's why they cannot say anything. The principle of cheaper healthcare is also a socialist concept, which is also why they cannot say anything.",-2,0,1443154279,1444724310

Because taxes are too high. If we lower the corporate tax rate, the private hospitals will reduce prices. If we reduce the individual tax rate (etc.), doctors will lower their prices.
Because there is too much regulation. If we reduce regulations, healthcare companies will spend less regulating, and will reduce prices.
