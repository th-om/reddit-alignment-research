They don't want to privatize services out of any principle or belief about the size or scope of government; it's just a way to funnel public money to private interests.",5,0,1444247320,1444723135
cvrfdpr,0,t1_cvr9v7a,MAGwastheSHIT,"Well, Putin invaded Georgia and resumed bomber patrols/probes off the US coast when Bush was in office. That wasn't  very respectful.

The Obama administration has been more overtly hostile to the Putin regime, criticizing them for human rights and calling out intervention in Ukraine and imposing sanctions and insultingly dismissing them as a ""regional power"".",1,0,1444235935,1444723135

cvpabme,1,t3_3nm1rl,MAGwastheSHIT,"It's been clear for a while that he gets his political views from AM talk-radio shows and believes in the worst kind of hyperbolic, conspiratorial, partisan idiocy. In the first debate he insinuated that Obama/Hillary are attempting to intentionally destroy the country and give it to our enemies. You know, because they hate America or whatever.",5,0,1444075904,1444723135

cvl3vqf,0,t1_cvl3lk0,MAGwastheSHIT,"That's what I don't get about the ""armed society is polite society"" argument. 

Imagine if there were an armed bystander during the Aurora theater shooting. Maybe he could intervene and take down the shooter and save lives. Maybe he couldn't.

Now imagine there are multiple armed bystanders during the Aurora theater shooting. Multiple strangers, all armed with guns in a dark theater full of panicked, screaming people running for their lives. I feel confident saying that situation just got worse, not better.

Don't get me wrong; I'm a gun owner and a concealed-carry permit holder, and I strongly support the 2nd Amendment right to individual ownership of firearms. But these fucking ""gun culture"" nutjobs are something else. Saying we need more guns to correct this problem is beyond asinine.",10,0,1443742424,1444723135

cvjlq6d,0,t1_cvji8ic,MAGwastheSHIT,"Sorry, you're just wrong. The CIA initially linked the attack to protests about the video, and the CIA made the talking points. This is well-established fact.

Here is the Report of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Review of the Terrorist Attacks on U.S. Facilities in Benghazi, Libya, September 11-12, 2012. PDF warning: https://www.congress.gov/113/crpt/srpt134/CRPT-113srpt134.pdf

Pp. 32-25 address the IC's (Intelligence Community, i.e. the CIA) analysis about whether there were protests at the same time as the attack.

Pp. 43-52 examine the CIA's talking points and the various revisions to them. 

Please tell me where you see *anything* about White House manipulation. That specific angle, as well as other GOP conspiracy theories about ""stand-down orders"" and the like, have **all** been thoroughly debunked. ",10,0,1443639397,1444723135
