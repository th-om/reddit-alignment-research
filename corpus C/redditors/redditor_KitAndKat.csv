cv1ffue,0,t1_cv19uw3,KitAndKat,"That's some serious cherry-picking there. Try instead her summary.

> Here’s my take: The Times has not ignored Mr. Sanders’s campaign by any means, but it also hasn’t always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories does seem regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of it is focused on the candidate’s age, appearance and style rather than what he has to say.

> And then there’s the Trump factor. While it’s certainly realistic, and reflective of reasonable news judgment, to give Mr. Sanders significantly less coverage than Mrs. Clinton, that’s not happening with another presidential long shot – Donald Trump – whose every utterance and dust-up seems to be breathlessly chronicled.

And you also say:

> That's an impressive twisting of words there

> New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan admitted today that people upset with the paper’s coverage of Bernie Sanders‘ campaign do have a point.

[mediamatter.org said](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/05/29/the-press-and-bernie-sanders/203813):

> On May 26, Sen. Bernie Sanders hosted his first major campaign rally since announcing his presidential candidacy last month. Staged on the banks of Lake Champlain in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont, the Sanders rally reportedly drew more than five thousand people, making it one of the largest campaign events of 2015, hosted by either a Democrat or a Republican.

> But the sprawling rally didn't cause much of a media stir. Rather than cover it as a major news event, the Washington Post ignored the rally in its print edition the next day, as did the New York Times, according to a search of the Nexis database. The network news programs that night covered the event in just a few sentences.

> At a time when it seems any movement on the Republican side of the candidate field produces instant and extensive press coverage, more and more observers are suggesting there's something out of whack with Sanders' press treatment.",-1,0,1442244128,1444729613
