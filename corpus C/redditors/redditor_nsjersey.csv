Where I live, the property taxes aren't terrible. They're most at the state average or below.

Go ahead consolidate the schools in some of the most segregated counties in the US:

* Essex
* Mercer
* Union
* Passaic
* Bergen

With a sprinkling of it in Camden & Atlantic counties. You think the seniors are mad about their taxes? Wait until you to to merge demographically different schools, just because they are close to each other. But I'm a parent & I'd do it, because we need to.

Look at roads. Lakewood can't handle volume. That costs. Environmental damage from sprawl too. Increased flooding from storm runoff. Not enough grass to absorb waters. Towns lose populations also. It's not like it's an even cycle. Then there are white elephant McMansions that boomers won't be able to sell.

cvtz3bf,1,t3_3o3jee,nsjersey,"One thing that I would hope the APP looks into more is schools. They've obviously hit up the teacher and pension-angle, but I'd love to see data (if it exists) on the population who (I feel) is most vested in keeping things status quo - **affluent parents of school-aged children.**

I mean, how many parents leave NYC and Philly just to send their kids to school here? Professional sports players in Philly almost always live in South Jersey for the schools.

An easy (in theory) solution would just be to regionalize schools by county or the like. Costs would go down, quality would also go down for some; up for others. But most parents (and people here) would be scared off by the demographic shift. 

Question #1 - You dampen the amount of quality schools and how much of those parents choosing to come here do we get?

Question #2 - After we educate NJ kids, we send [the largest amount to other colleges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/new-jerseys-student-drain-is-gain-for-district-colleges/2012/01/19/gIQAkjiAMQ_story.html). How many come back? If the state was run like a business, wouldn't we want to see some return on the investment in our kids (like them also becoming taxpayers or at least getting similar types of twentysomethings back in return from someplace else)? 

Question #3 - The revolving door of voters. Since NJ is so transient, this can hurt our democracy here. Parents in wealthy districts often sell their homes when the youngest child graduates from high school. They might move to a cheaper part of the state, or out. This makes it less likely for them to be involved on a political level over a longer-term.  ",1,0,1444415413,1444717660
