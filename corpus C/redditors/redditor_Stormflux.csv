cvxo114,0,t1_cvxn4p3,Stormflux,"I worked desktop support in 2001 and you'd be amazed how many secretaries could barely operate a mouse...

The point I'm trying to get across is that although you and I may have had Internet in 2001, people's *moms* and *grandparents* weren't yet using it that much.  That's one reason those dotcom storefronts failed; people weren't ready for it.  And, you know, when it comes to policy, those peoples' voices probably count for more.",1,1,1444700975,1444717612

cvxmawd,0,t1_cvxgcvj,Stormflux,"Sure, we had Internet back in 2001, but it was mostly people like us using it.  College students, computer nerds, teenagers getting mp3's.

Suzie at work didn't use it.  She was too busy putting flags on her car antenna and being scared of Anthrax.  I think we all know Suzie at work.

Then you went on to say something *less* useful was *more* useful.  WTH man?",1,0,1444663137,1444717612
cvwyv0s,0,t1_cvwuxjo,Stormflux,">All of these stats are not relevant.  The fact is that they are still supporting the browsers for some. 

What's relevant to me is whether I have to support it or not.  Thus, the usage stats matter.  It doesn't mean much to me whether it's officially supported by Microsoft if it's only going to be like 3 users, with severely outdated computers, who aren't going to buy anything anyway.",2,0,1444662736,1444717612
cvwkigr,0,t1_cvwj7ju,Stormflux,"Lots of blame to go around.  If I had to pin it all on one guy, personally, I'd blame Admiral Souchon for causing the Russian and Ottoman Empires to fall, thereby leading to the creation of the USSR, leaving a power vacuum in the Middle East, *and*, quite possibly, contributing to the United States becoming more interventionist.
