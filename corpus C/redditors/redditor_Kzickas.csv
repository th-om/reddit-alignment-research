cvtlgoo,1,t3_3nhz3m,Kzickas,">I've been able to start off relatively well by spamming my sacred units but I seem to stall agree the first year or so.

Since your sacreds are capital only you can't rely on them in the long run.

>I'm not really sure what mages to build and what to do with them.

Anathemant dragons mostly. The warlock paths, blood and astral, are more specialized paths. You can learn those later. Stick with fire for now.

I'd research evocation to three for fireball first. It does very good armor piercing fire damage to one square, and also does a good deal of fatigue damage in a wide area. Then I'd research conjuration three for pheonix power (increases your mages fire magic by one for the rest of the battle, decreasing the fatigue they take and making their fire spells more powerful). Then keep researching evocation for the bigger fire spells.

>Also I've got no idea what makes for a good pretender. I've been playing around with the Dragon, and I read a guide that introduced me to the concept of a Rainbow build, but I want to sure how to effectively use that pretender.

Don't go for a rainbow pretender. You're likely to be overwhelmed with choices just from your national stuff. You won't be able to use the extra options a rainbow gives you until you have some experience. When starting out I'd go with a scales pretender. Taking good scales just gives you more of what you'd have anyway which helps you learn how to use your national stuff. Then you can realize what you'd like to supplement it with later. If you take an imprisoned Divine Glyph with dominion strength 8 (to help spread your good scales) you can afford to take positive scales to +3 in all scales except one where you're left with +2.

>So any tips both specific to Abysia and in general would be helpful.

Your troops are strong defensively, but lack a bit of punch. Your mages can easily burn anything without fire resistance to death. In multiplayer your enemy will start casting fire resist spells, but the AI generally won't. The large area effect fire resist spells come at alteration 5 and enchantment 5, so you'll have a window of opportunity, even in MP, between the time you get fireball and the enemy gets protection from it.",2,0,1444392565,1444718598
