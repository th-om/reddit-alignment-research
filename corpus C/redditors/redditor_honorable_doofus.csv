Just like with the Keystone pipeline, gay marriage, and the Iraq war, she suddenly switches her position to the more popular one among Democrats.  Can anyone ever really be sure of what she really believes in?  

Besides, this is especially troubling because free trade is widely accepted among economists as providing a net benefit to all countries involved.  This deal affects trade, [which doesn't affect a very large percentage of American workers in unions.  Nor are trade agreements the real cause of lack of improvement in worker wages.](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/03/20/why-are-unions-so-focused-on-fighting-trade-deals/)  Clinton is surrounded by policy and economics experts, and she was instrumental to bringing these nations together to negotiate a trade pact.  Sorry Clinton, I just don't believe you.  ",14,0,1444313810,1444718418
cvppecp,0,t1_cvposie,honorable_doofus,"That's some okay logic right there, but there's a reason why theorizing is never enough to convince anyone of an assertion.  I could just as easily surmise that the jobs lost are due to natural market forces that would have forced those people out of work anyway and that free trade agreements, such as NAFTA, simply don't overturn this inevitability.  The outcomes for both of our theories are precisely the same, but there's no way to determine who's more correct without a study.  Hell, we could both be entirely off base.  

In any case, we don't have to theorize anything.  Smarter people in on the subject who's jobs aren't determined by corporate whims do this sort of thing already.  We just need to read their work and compare different opinions to draw a reasoned conclusion.  In the case of free trade, economists that are all along the political spectrum seem to be in agreement that free trade agreements, although harmful for specific types of laborers, confers a net benefit to those involved in the form of increased jobs of higher skilled labor and lower prices of consumer goods.

cvpo8ee,0,t1_cvpc4fz,honorable_doofus,"Only 5 of 29 chapters has anything to do with free trade?  How can anyone know that if the final text hasn't even been made public?  None of the supposed leaks, to my knowledge, has ever even confirmed how each chapter would be organized or what the specifics are.  Just the general stuff we had all assumed would be in it from the beginning.  Call me skeptical but something about all those sites you've just linked seem highly dubious sources to develop a viewpoint on the agreement.  There's nothing unusual about writing international agreements in secret and only making it public when the wording is final.  It's kind of an important venture to take so that any agreement of any sort can get done.  ",0,0,1444098995,1444718418

It would make their people more anti-America than ever because it would be an act of war and totally disrespect any notions of real political sovereignty that we might say we have towards other nations, which would be a diplomatic disaster.  You could pretty much guarantee the Iranian government becoming even more radical and insular plus I'd wager a doubling down on acquiring a nuclear weapon, regardless of any deal.

cuwqwnp,1,t3_3keglm,honorable_doofus,"The author of this opinion piece discusses the refugee crisis currently inflicting Syria's neighbors and Europe and ties the current civil war in Syria with President Obama's foreign policy.  He makes an interesting point in that this administration's aversion to escalate military intervention in Syria makes him partly responsible for the current crisis.  The main idea here is that a policy of nonintervention by the US can be just as destructive and devastating as a policy of American overreach in the Middle East (i.e. the Iraq War).

In my opinion, the author puts an unfair amount of blame at Obama's feet.  While we may look back in retrospect about possible military options in Syria might have helped mitigate the current crisis (i.e. bombing Syria after Assad's use of chemical weapons), this is hindsight bias and doesn't really tell the whole nuanced story of what Obama may have hoped to achieve in the region.  I also think that describing Obama's Middle East policy as one of ""nonintervention"" and ""abandonment"" is far from accurate, because we are still using military options in the form of drone strikes and giving monetary and arms support for our regional allies who may need it in the event that the SCW spills out of the country.",6,0,1441894586,1444718418
cuw7n6h,0,t1_cuvujjc,honorable_doofus,"You didn't understand anything from my last post.  You're combating points I didn't even make, so talking to you is completely useless.  You advocate for ideas that no expert on the subject of overpopulation advocates and you have no evidence whatsoever to support your argumentum ad populum on whether people think poor people should have kids or not.  News flash dumbass, the majority of the world is poor.  You honestly think if I took a random sample of people of a mixed population that the plurality would support sterilizing people on government assistance?  Ehhh I have my doubts about that.  Besides, even if most people did support it, it's still an argumentum ad populum fallacy.  Your positions are fundamentally at odds with modern notions of human rights.   ",2,0,1441843471,1444718418
cuvcdu5,0,t1_cus9ugv,honorable_doofus,"This comment is so dystopian it's disgusting.  First of all, reproduction is widely considered a right, [including via international treaty and by law](http://www.unfpa.org/resources/supporting-constellation-reproductive-rights).  

Secondly, how do decide what exactly is the ideal situation to bring up a child in?  Who decides that?  The government?  If you live in a democracy and the government is controlled by a political party you're at odds with, would you trust them to decide you're own readiness to have a child?  What if you're in a one-party autocracy?    Do you think your politicians would give a fuck about your idea of an ideal financial situation?  

Thirdly, your 'ideal traits' comment is very disturbing.  The topic of gene therapy and eugenics as it relates to possibly improving the human gene pool is a common one in bioethics and genetics courses all over the world.  [The NIH has a pretty good summary of what's covered](http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/therapy/ethics), but the bottom line here is what you're talking about is what is sometimes referred to as a ""Hitler problem.""  It's a problem where we have someone or some party of people thinking they know what's best for society, in this case it's in terms of how to make the gene pool more perfect by excluding those who aren't 'ideal.'  Where is the line drawn?  At what point does an allele of a gene become non-ideal?  And how does one prevent the one who decides that from taking that definition too far?

Lastly, you can't solve the overpopulation problem by forcing the world to have some perfect birth rate.  You'd never be able to enforce it anyway unless we were ruled by autocracy (i.e. China) or dictatorship.  Additionally, controlling the world's birth rate by force wouldn't even be the most effective way to stop overpopulation.  If you look at the reproductive trends of developed vs. developing countries, then it's becomes obviously clear that the best way to solve overpopulation is by giving the world easy access to birth control and by making sure women have a high level of education.  Once those are attained, the a tumbling birth rate will follow.  Infringing on everyone's reproductive rights bloody retarded.",2,0,1441779300,1444718418
cuv0otc,0,t1_cuuxx3j,honorable_doofus,"People disagree with Supreme Court rulings all the time.  With nearly every decision.  Conservatives still disagree with the Roe v. Wade decision and many liberals disagree with the Citizens United decision.  Even later Supreme Court justices disagree with ruling made by previous justices.  Everyone is allowed to disagree with a ruling and fight it through legal means (by trying to get a ruling overturned).  But in spite of rulings, the law must be followed.  So if the Supreme Court rules one way, you can't defy it because that would be considered unconstitutional.  There's a difference between defying the law and simply disagreeing with its interpretation by the courts.",1,0,1441756441,1444718418
