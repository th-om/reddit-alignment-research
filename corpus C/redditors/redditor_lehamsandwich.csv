cv6a3oy,1,t3_3lgdf5,lehamsandwich,"Rubio's in the middle of the pack, but national polling right now is pretty meaningless, and I don't think Rubio particularly cares about his national poll numbers right now - right now his major concerns are convincing donors and scoring endorsements, two areas where his strong debate performances really help. 

We're still months away from the Iowa caucus, and if I'm Rubio I don't want to peak too early in the polls. 538 has expanded on this more than I ever can, but people who lead the polls this early in the Republican primaries normally don't end up with the nomination (see Gingrich, Santorum, 2008 Huckabee, etc.). The only polling Rubio is concerned about is his overall favorability rating,  and, as the most liked by Republicans besides Ben Carson, he is in great shape.

In early 2016, you can expect to see heavy campaigning and some ad buys by the Rubio team as they attempt to increase their standing, but until then don't expect too much of a polling rise for Marco. ",1,0,1442609380,1444727095
ctmu7dx,1,t3_3fan1o,lehamsandwich,"I don't support Trump, and neither do most Republican voters. What Trump has going for him is a very dedicated 20-25% of Republican primary voters who are enamored with his ""direct"" style and immigration stance. The issue is that the remaining 75% of Republican primary voters (including the 50% who have a negative opinion of Trump) have divided their votes over 15 other candidates. When the debates come around and candidates start dropping out/consolidating their votes, then we will see Trump fall off to 3rd/4th. ",17,0,1438354983,1444727095
