Is this really any different than a sports bookie betting on Vegas lines?",3,0,1444363423,1444717600

It certainly *is* a legalized form of gambling (and their constant barrage of advertising certainly is annoying as fuck, especially since they're not at all clever unlike DirecTV's), but just because when you gamble you're more likely to lose money instead of win it doesn't make it a scam.

The allegations in the lawsuit are that FD/DK employees were using the analytics to play on the competing site, giving them an advantage in picking the right players.  I'm not sure if that's actionable, and it would probably give those employees an advantage over regular users, but it's not something that's happening to the company's benefit.
