I'm pretty ok with living in ""ghetto"" areas - spent most of my time in Burlington living in the Old North End, which was our version of a ghetto (not that Vermont's ""bad neighborhoods"" are a particularly terrifying prospect, haha... it was mostly drug deals and the occasional break-in, nobody was getting murdered or anything). As a single female planning to live alone I'll have a care to not end up in a slum, but Yuma doesn't seem particularly crime-ridden overall based on my first impressions.",1,0,1444416752,1444724624

cvt8bn0,0,t1_cvt7xuh,birdsforfree,"Aww, I like snakes. They're so dopey with their no legs. Spiders on the other hand have too many and should be considered the enemy. Don't think I've ever encountered a scorpion so I'll reserve judgement on those. Does that mean I don't have to shake out my shoes before I put them on?",2,0,1444355360,1444724624
cvt8802,0,t1_cvt7ige,birdsforfree,"Cool, where'd you move from? 

Most recently I worked at a syringe exchange back in Vermont but I've had a bunch of different jobs in various industries over the years. I'd love to find something in social work but I'm going to be casting a wide net when it comes to the job search :) If there's a catch-all social services agency around here, that might be where I'd start.",1,0,1444355200,1444724624
cvt7xxs,0,t1_cvt7k23,birdsforfree,What are the good parts of town? I was hoping for a place close to what I'm assuming is downtown (lower numbered Sts/Aves) but on reflection I guess I don't know if that's a good area or not. ,1,0,1444354754,1444724624
cvt7cxq,0,t1_cvt75ed,birdsforfree,"Sweet, thanks! 

I hate heat but I also hate cold, and it turns out there's basically nowhere on Earth except maybe Ecuador that can comfortably accommodate my neediness climate-wise. So might as well go big or go home I guess :) I'll be sure to work in a few smug Facebook posts when all my friends back home are trudging around in waistdeep snow. 

Um, can I ask you a question? It's about scorpions. Are there scorpions?? ",1,0,1444353829,1444724624

I'm seeing one bedroom places for sub-$400 on CL btw... what is this fairytale world and why have I been paying $500 to live with four roommates?? ",1,0,1444347555,1444724624
