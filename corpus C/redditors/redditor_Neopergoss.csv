cvxcz2q,0,t1_cvx54s2,Neopergoss,"Greenwald and journalists like him are responding to the bias that exists in mainstream media that pretends to be objective. It's a disgusting type of journalism that merely parrots what influential people are saying. Real journalism should have a bias towards truth, not towards respecting existing power structures. When two people are having a discussion and you know one of them is lying, the right thing to do is not to simply report that they disagreed, but to point out the truth.",3,0,1444683655,1444720625

The person who's being appointed to the FDA is unlikely to pursue that kind of agenda because he's being funded by people who make money from name brand drugs. That's why Bernie Sanders is opposing his appointment.
