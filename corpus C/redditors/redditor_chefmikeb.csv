cvuq4al,1,t3_3o5i0z,chefmikeb,"This was about 17 or so years ago.  It was about 1 in the morning and I was driving home from work and I saw a bright light just ahead of me on the road. I thought it was another car's headlights on bright but when I came around the bend I saw a pick up truck that had gone off the road into a tree and was on fire.  I pulled over to see if I could help and then I heard a loud thump (I was later told it was the truck's gas tank exploding). It was so hot that I couldn't get even close to the truck.  I drove up the road until I found a house with the lights on,  knocked on their door and asked them to call 911 and went back to help direct the police/fire to the scene. They asked me to stay clear so I went home (I lived about a mile and a half away).  It turned out that my wife had heard the gas tank in the truck explode and then the sirens and thought I had been in an accident since I should have been home by then.  She was pacing in the front yard in her nightie. After I filled her in I went back to the accident to see if the police there wanted to talk with me.  As I walked back to the police car in saw the driver's body in the driver seat of the truck hunched over the steering wheel.  He was all burnt up with steam coming from the eye sockets of his skull.  The thing that sticks with me to this day (besides the visual)  was the smell of roasting meat.  All these years later I still flash back to it once in a while.  I could never deal with having to see stuff like that day to day.  I would go nuts.  Much respect to ems/police/firemen. 

TLDR; Truck on fire,  charred smoking skull,  smell of roasting meat.

cvpgv51,0,t1_cvpaz7p,chefmikeb,Like French /Asian fusion the idea is to use regional Asian ingredients with an eye to Italian cooking methods.   There is a restaurant in New York City called Kin Shop that is a great example of this where foods are Thai but the sensibility is Italian. ,1,0,1444086297,1444730808
cvp7am9,1,t3_3nkfle,chefmikeb,When we see Quick Service Chains in the USA sourcing ingredients we can probably says that trend is out (think Chipotle or eve McDonald's now). Small plates are popular still but I personally think the next big thing will be twofold. I hope asian/Italian fusion finally takes off and I believe that we will see chefs going back to nouvelle cuisine and let some Middle Eastern food sensibilities influence that reinterpretation.   We'll see what happens. ,3,0,1444071421,1444730808
cvlzty4,1,t3_3n98p4,chefmikeb,CDC told us to blanch broccoli so was getting my mise together for the job and the sous asked what I was doing and I told him.   Then he says to me just put in in the steamer and put in the walk in on sheet pans.   I said to him that isn't what blanch means and he said that's what it meant to him.   Needless to say the CDC was pissed off about it later cause it wasn't what he wanted. The sous stepped up though and took the heat like a pro instead of trying to lay it on me. ,8,0,1443812697,1444730808

cv3x2ph,0,t1_cv3s3ga,chefmikeb,Sorry I wasn't clear.  He was on death row for 20 years.  Connecticut has a death penalty but the way it is written it was pretty much unenforceable. It came down to Michael Ross actually asking to be executed to spare the families of his victims any more pain.  In 1998 or so I was a chef in charge of a production kitchen.  The father I speak of was a cook there at the time. Michael Ross was executed by the state of Connecticut in 2005.,3,0,1442436015,1444730808
cv3pp5k,1,t3_3l5wqf,chefmikeb,Yeah I got that.  I don't believe that a Marsala sauce and cabbage would work very well together.  I just wanted to share a different potential approach. ,1,0,1442425413,1444730808
cv3hmqk,1,t3_3l5wqf,chefmikeb,"Agreed.  In this case I would make a spicy chili glaze for the chicken and stir fry the cabbage with some peppers,  onions,  and Indian spices (Masala,  curry,  turmeric).. Maybe some spicy chili peppers too. ",0,0,1442413094,1444730808
cv3fr91,1,t3_3l5ad7,chefmikeb,"[Michael Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bruce_Ross)

He killed two 14 year old girls that lived just down the road from me when I was 14.  We had all thought they ran away from home (as they had done that before).  They had been hitchhiking through Lisbon, CT where he picked them up and killed them.  After that he killed another girl the next town over and the police had found her body when she was reported missing.  It was during the investigation for that when he walked into the building the state police were using for the investigation of that murder and confessed.

It was right after that confession that they found the bodies of his other victims when he gave up where he hid them.  Connecticut executed him and then the state effectively made it impossible to  enforce the death penalty law after that.

The father of one of the girls ended up working for me in a kitchen about 15 years later and he was still focused on forcing the state to execute him.  I'm not pro-death penalty since you can never be 100% sure of the conviction but in this case he had it coming.  

I knew them pretty well as they lived just up the road from me.  I still have dreams about them sometimes, you know day to day stuff like riding on the bus or sitting in class.  Weird I know.",56,0,1442409627,1444730808
cv1dulw,1,t3_3kwcqg,chefmikeb,You could look at Stratton - Warren for recipe/inventory management.  I miss it.  I work at a place that uses Eatec and I'm not a big fan. ,2,0,1442254152,1444730808
