cvxbjl4,0,t1_cvxbcs7,MuscleAndAShovel,"Honestly, CLoudyG2 did it for me. Then, I discovered XDABEBB, which I think has more features, but CLoudy just had better battery life in my personal experience.",1,0,1444681657,1444722575
cvxasw4,1,t3_3og8ri,MuscleAndAShovel,"When people have songs as their text tone. Bonus points if they leave it turned up all the way. This one woman came into the store the other day and she was texting the whole time. Every time it went off, it started playing the beginning of Bad Blood by Taylor Swift.

I honestly love TS's music, but to hear the beginning go off every few seconds is annoying. Plus, I'd show her something, and the phone would go off and she would just let it play for a minute.",1,0,1444680617,1444722575

cvx4e24,1,t3_3ogt1v,MuscleAndAShovel,"LGG2, even though it came out after 2012, is my favorite phone ever. The skin sucked at first but with the usual Nova/blah blah stuff, I got it right. It was and still is a great phone.",18,0,1444671401,1444722575
cvx4a2q,1,t3_3ogz63,MuscleAndAShovel,"There are just so many non-Nexus devices that are hard/impossible to root and even harder to unlock the bootloader. Most Verizon devices and many ATT devices are locked down, and that makes up a HUGE amount of android devices. 

I root and unlock every devices I get, but I had the Verizon G4 and now have the Note 5 and I can't unlock the root the Note 5 and neither has an unlocked bootloader.",24,0,1444671238,1444722575

cvwxwgg,0,t1_cvwwxhe,MuscleAndAShovel,I just like engrams because it levels up Cryptarch.,2,0,1444661052,1444722575
cvwvnwh,0,t1_cvwvk0n,MuscleAndAShovel,"That is so dumb though, and you miss out on opportunities to get engrams. It really isn't THAT hard when you have a half-decent group. The time goes by faster when you are doing something, plus having multiple people on the circle fighting makes it load faster.",1,0,1444656524,1444722575

It blows my mind that he was a drifter in WaterWorld. I hadn't seen it in 10 years when I rewatched it this weekend.",3,0,1444655744,1444722575
