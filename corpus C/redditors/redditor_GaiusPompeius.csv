cvxrp19,0,t1_cvxre7w,GaiusPompeius,I'd love to play a fox-hunting video game where there are literally no controls.  You just put the controller down and get a beer while the game follows the fox for you.  And then you get an Xbox achievement when it's done! ,2,0,1444706856,1444727304
cvxpkfw,0,t1_cvxpg9i,GaiusPompeius,"Also, I never really understood the concept of fox-hunting as a sport.  You just have to stay on your horse while it does all the work of chasing down the fox?",2,0,1444703372,1444727304
cvxp82o,1,t3_3oixab,GaiusPompeius,"From what I remember from reading *Gawain and the Green Knight*, Gawain ultimately resists the sexual advances of his host's wife and thus proves his moral right to escape death.  But, he is tempted at one point, so he gets a scar to remind him of his moral failure.  And Gawain is totally cool with this outcome.  He must be a riot at parties.",3,0,1444702863,1444727304
cvx4qzx,1,t3_3od5j1,GaiusPompeius,"Also, does this really fit the literary definition of a parable?  A parable is supposed to be a short allegorical story that conveys some truth by use of analogy.  The story in the linked page seems to be more of a direct prediction.",2,0,1444671919,1444727304
cvx3p3o,1,t3_3of1nq,GaiusPompeius,"If you're looking for older games like *Pool of Radiance* or *Eye of the Beholder* from the late '80s and early '90s, I might suggest checking out [The CRPG Addict's Blog](http://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_3.html).  He does a really good job reviewing games from this era, and his list of highest-ranked games might give you a good starting point.  In particular, he places a big emphasis on character creation and skill development.",1,0,1444670384,1444727304
cvx26f2,1,t3_3ogv7j,GaiusPompeius,"For a while I tried to combat this by naming my characters things like ""Stupidface"", but I couldn't bear to go on with the game and had to restart.",1,0,1444668079,1444727304
cvx1bmp,1,t3_3ogq9d,GaiusPompeius,"From what I understand, the definition of socialism has changed over the years.  When Karl Marx introduced it in the 19th century, ""socialism"" referred to a method of organizing society such that the proletariat (the working class) would communally own the means of production (factories, shops, and so on) instead of the bourgeoisie, and would not compete with each other to utilize their wage labor.  In order to get to this point, Marx suggested a series of social reforms such as heavily progressive taxes, the centralization of banks and major industries by the government, and other such reforms which are nowadays associated with ""the extreme left"".  By the original definition, a society isn't fully socialist so long as the bourgeois class is permitted to privately own the means of production, but some things you're mentioning like nationalizing industries could be seen by some as ""socialist reforms"".",3,0,1444666763,1444727304
cvwo7ut,1,t3_3oea7w,GaiusPompeius,"Hi Peter, welcome!  Socializing is something that we all struggle with a lot of the time: not just us here in MLSG, but most people I've met in my life.  Just don't feel like you're alone, because a lot more people that you meet every day struggle with the same issues.  Learning to socialize is hard for everyone, even if some people have an easier time looking like everything is OK.  Feel free to talk any time.",2,0,1444629476,1444727304
