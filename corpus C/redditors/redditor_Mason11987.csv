Because this is asking about a condition you suffer it qualifies as a personal problem according to the sidebar rules.

If this really is a complex conceptual question about the human body and not a question about you specifically, you can rephrase and resubmit without reference to yourself and try again. (Body questions are pretty common though, so try a quick search!) Good luck!

cvxny2i,1,t3_3oj3d9,Mason11987,"They were descendents from a group of humans that crossed from what is now Russia over to what is now Alaska.  This happened 16k to 11k years ago.  Eventually as the ice age ended sea levels rose leading to the land they crossed to end up under water.  This meant the humans being able to populate the New World without interacting with the humans elsewhere.  Columbus also wasn't the first European to come across the New World.

Edit - It wasn't an ice bridge.",3,0,1444700847,1444720884

Nope, it's definitely a real thing.

Modern touchscreens work better than older touchscreens because they don't depend on actual pressure, but instead on very minor variations in resistance to a tiny electric charge.  This is why most touch screens won't work if you try to use a regular pen or your gloved hand to work it.  It's **also** why water mixes it up.  You are actually mostly water so your finger and a drop of water are hard to distinguish on the screen.",5,0,1444685135,1444720884
cvx7zd4,1,t3_3ohh7h,Mason11987,"I've never read a single thing online which made it seem like he ""singlehandedly killed all of the Native Americans"".  What is online (like [here](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/columbus_day)) are things which show that he wasn't a good person, and he directly caused an enormous amount of harm to many many people and indirectly harmed massive numbers of people through ushering in the gold trade.

I doubt anyone actually suggests he personally murdered millions of people.",2,0,1444676570,1444720884

Also mars isn't going to become earth like.  The terraforming we can do there (with anything near our current technology) will change it from ""absolutely horrible place to be"" to ""somewhat comparable to the worst places on earth"", maybe.

Because mars has little atmosphere, and apparently no life it's more of a blank slate.  It's like comparing how much you can improve a blank  canvas vs a Rembrandt.  Sure, maybe an expert could touch up some details of a Rembrandt but it's FAR more likely we'd just screw it up.  With a blank canvas almost anything is generally considered better than nothing.

Also, removing gasses is a much bigger issue then adding them, which is what we're ultimately going to be doing on Mars.  We're quite capable at creating greenhouse gases.",7,0,1444651359,1444720884
cvwtky8,1,t3_3ofvoo,Mason11987,"Both Dwarves and Elves as concepts predate Tolkien.

Both Dwarves and Elves were creatures of germanic mythology, although tolkien added some features, some were traditional such as elves and their relationship to bow/arrows and purity, and dwarves and their size/mining/underground nature.

So you're allowed to use Elves like you're allowed to use things like zeus in the God of War games.",4,0,1444650616,1444720884
