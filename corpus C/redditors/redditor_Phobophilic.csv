cvifhno,0,t1_cvi8qws,Phobophilic,"The already released Tesla vehicles are luxury cars. They're sold at between 70k-100k dollars. It's more an implied than actual argument to which you're replying, but it's definitely not a strawman. 

>I stated specifically, with Telsa as an example, about price controls on cars for eliminating pollution. Telsa, for example, could be told they have to sell their cars for less than $20k, allowing Americans of all economic classes, to reduce their pollution.   

Tesla is not a great example for other reasons. They have already made available most (all?) of their patent portfolio for use by others. Furthermore, most electric vehicle purchases allow a $7500 federal tax credit. In other words, they're a subsidized section of the market. They're not brought down to your 20k mark, but our current toolset is being used to reduce the costs associated with electric vehicles.

It seems that you want to debate the merits/criticisms of changing the United States into more of a planned economy. Currently we would probably be regarded as a mixed economy. The government sets limits or provides subsidies for some industries in order to keep prices stable, or to promote job creation, or to expand industries viewed as important for the future. 

However, what we usually don't do is set prices. Perhaps most importantly, setting prices as opposed to subsidizing is more inflexible than the market may require. If manufacturers have capped prices they can't as easily weather supply chain problems, and are not incentivized to provide for multiple segments of the market. Some people are obviously willing to pay more than 20k for a high performance electric vehicle. Tesla or other manufacturers would be spurning profits and growth potential if they were disallowed to sell to this market.

One might reply that the legislature could craft limits to be more dynamic or open, or to respond in a timely fashion to new economic circumstances, but both are tough asks. More dynamic laws are certainly possible, but it will be harder to predict their outcomes, and to my mind seem more likely to have loopholes. Political solutions generally are likely to be too slow, at least with the law creation process as it currently exists.

Anyway, despite my efforts and those of some others here, you're likely to get far better and more complete discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of a planned or command economy and when they apply by using Google than Reddit.",1,0,1443555006,1444722251

You can switch between topics at will, and/or try letting the site find your knowledge gaps by attempting sample questions. It will give you a learning plan of questions and linked YouTube videos that average about 5-10 mins in length.

Aim to master the topics I mentioned, or at least try to gain some fluency with the concepts.

Honestly, it seems like an odd choice given that there are probably more ways to do procedural generation than there are math disciplines, and each of the former may use diverse, mixed techniques from the latter. It will depend heavily on what you hope to create and its requirements rather than some catch-all procedural generation shared math. You're most likely to find articles discussing the math involved in rendering, but that's somewhat tangential to what you seem to be asking. 

However, if you want to brush up on much of the math with an online source, I'd recommend KhanAcademy, though you could look at MIT OpenCourseWare or Coursera to see if those are a better fit for you. You just have to know the topics you want to review (probably trigonometry, linear algebra and derivative and integral calculus). It should be relatively straightforward to apply that generalized learning to any domain whether you're simulating conversations, histories, people, planets, walking robots or what have you.

cti1itw,0,t1_ctgqvfk,Phobophilic,"What you wrote has definitely crystallized in my mind a point of epistemic disagreement between us. You seem to be willing to evaluate a logical argument on its own terms. I am not so willing. My position may sound controversial or uncharitable on first glance, so I must explain why.

Regardless of the particulars of an argument's metaphysical framework, we should or we must always be able to ask the following question. Are the premises and metaphysical girding veridical/consistent with reality? If we do not ask such a question, the process of logic can *prove* more things than cohere with reality. After all, all real propositions are true and all true propositions are internally consistent, but the same can't be said in the other direction. Since logic is a set of rules concerning internal consistency, we must verify that the premises of each particular argument and the framework of a set of arguments are veridical if we hope to gain veridical conclusions. 

Provisionally I'm going to assume you agree with this, but I still must explain why it matters to our positions or why I characterize your position as I do. 

>That an alt-unicorn cannot be detected as a member of the physical universe is a great reasons to reject its existence, and finding a premise of deductive arguments for God unsound is a great reason to reject those arguments.

You admit you are holding the propositions to different standards here and just above the quote, but you seem to feel that is not a problem but a feature. The Alt-unicorn propositions must not only be veridical, but falsifiable. The God propositions must only be logical. How is this not arbitrary? Even if the God belief is not falsifiable because of its nature, it can still be assessed on its coherence with reality. By way of example, below I take an example of yours and try to put it in contact with reality.

> An Aristotelian hierarchical causation....needs to be grounded in something for any potentials to be actualized at all.

I don't disagree with that if hierarchical causation is assumed to be veridical in all circumstances. But must it be turtles all the way down to God? Well let's look at the lowest turtle of which we know. The big bang is currently best understood as a nonevent. A nonevent shares important properties with a generalized monotheists' God. It is without spacetime or framed more akin to God-talk it is eternal and everywhere (until it isn't). It is causally linked to spacetime events where t>0, but no other causal relations can be derived. There is no next link, no contingency, no room for an intentional entity if quantum indeterminacy and eternity are involved. Chance will suffice. Asserting that the happening is caused by a separate *simultaneous* entity labeled God is quite empty. The only justification for God here is belief. As you said, other arguments are required to demonstrate a theist's preferred God properties, but if the big bang is a good explanation for the causation attributed to God, their conceptual separation can only be identified in the motivations for the post hoc arguments or in the arguments themselves. The necessary functions of God in a cosmological argument inhere in the big bang, an entity with properties that would invalidate the post hoc arguments. Substitute big bang for God and they just don't work.

Now maybe that's not the way reality was or is. It's a best theory, but scientific revolutions have occurred before. However, there are other possibilities than intentional entities, some of which I previously mentioned, but no out and out justification to assume intentionality as a better explanation than them.",2,0,1438022191,1444722251
ctf7dui,0,t1_ctevyu2,Phobophilic,">Most of the good reasons would be arguments for the classical theist's God. There's a rich philosophical tradition there. 

I can't disagree that the tradition is rich in apologetics for God, but that tradition is far from convincing from my perspective and that of many others. I don't say that to imply that since many agree with me, therefore I am right. After all, more people probably disagree with me. However, any proof these arguments may offer should be considered to be of unresolved veracity. If its developments over time were more conclusive we wouldn't even be debating this. To view the richness of the tradition itself as indicative of such arguments' force would be a mistake. Most religious traditions have a rich apologetics, but in the western world we happen to be most familiar with one of them. Our familiarity should not be mistaken for unique argumentative strength.

>Asking someone to enumerate ""all the reasons"" is just ridiculous though. 

I can see how you might have read it that way, but it wasn't my intent. I wasn't asking you to enumerate every argument in the history of said apologetics. Ignore the ""and"" between the two phrases and hopefully you will better understand my meaning, but to restate: could you lay out in an orderly fashion (so I don't have to read every post in this thread where it's scattered and/or stated in different fashions) which justifications you feel are unique to deistic or Christian God apologetics that invalidate a comparison to the apologetics of other religious or mystical traditions.

>(1) is incorrect. It's that it logically follows from premises about things like contingency, not an appeal to unexplained phenomenon.   It's not trying to fill a gap in scientific knowledge, which is admittedly where plenty of people go wrong. 

I thought I saw you write something like (1) in the discussion of this post by mentioning the teleological argument, but I'll withdraw it. It could easily have been someone else. I'm not certain with your mention of contingency whether you're alluding to a cosmological or ontological argument. Could you clarify? 

A cosmological argument is at least challenged by some of the relatively recent and surprising scientific findings (spontaneous particle generation, causation that at least appears to go backward in time, possibilities of an eternal universe). The argument loses a great deal of its argumentative force. It's hard to ignore its intuitive appeal, but going forward we may conclusively prove rather than just have some suggestive evidence that some of its premises are faulty.

>(2) It can certainly be easily disproven - showing the argument is unsound. It's just not amenable to the sort of scientific investigation we'd use for a unicorn (which is the point I've been belligerently trying to make). 

We (western philosophy people) have been debating the same arguments for centuries. I hate to foreclose the possibility of philosophical progress, but I doubt there's much more meat left on the bone here, at least not likely enough to convert people from sides that are so committed to their perspectives. I think one either finds the arguments or their criticisms to be convincing already.

I believe some people are frustrated with your pulling out some specific examples from a list meant to give a flavor of possible counterexamples, not meant as perfect analogies. I could modify the unicorn belief to make it more appropriate. For instance I could suggest that Alt-unicorns can only be seen by people that believe in them, that they don't walk on the ground, but fly, and somewhat like reptiles their body temperatures match their surroundings. I imagine with little effort you could think up some other kind of experimental test to detect my Alt-unicorns, but I could also invent more possible properties of Alt-unicorns that would prevent your test from working. But don't focus on the specifics of the properties I've invented or how the totality may still differ from the God belief. My point is only that we are capable of defining concepts immune to disproof, but that a concept so defined is not proven by this immunity. The deistic God belief is definitely of this kind, and the Christian God belief is primarily of this kind.

>(3) I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this. 

I was referring to the ontological argument. Perhaps the original criticism leveled against it is that it can be used to prove the existence of a multitude of perfect necessities. It is in that way that I meant some ideas are self-justifying.",2,0,1437782881,1444722251
cteui73,0,t1_cter7ds,Phobophilic,"Can you enumerate all the reasons that justify a belief in God and that from your perspective makes it different from the other list?

Hopefully there's more than just (1) the belief explains currently unexplained things and (2) the belief does not posit a corporeal entity, so cannot be easily disproven, (3) the belief is self-justifying. Those are what I'm getting from your posts so far, but those alone could be used to justify many beliefs of varying a priori probabilities and so should be seen to justify no beliefs.

cswnmkk,0,t1_cswfsye,Phobophilic,"I don't deny Silver's historical accuracy. However, two points. Previously accurate predictions do not imply that everything the man does is likely to be accurate. If you actually look at his models, the average number of state presidential voting outcomes that he is likely to get wrong is a bit less than 3 per election. Even though he's still likely to be highly accurate given his normal methods, the fact that he was as close as he has been is somewhat of a fluke.

Secondly, this article does not use the same sort of methods or reasoning as such predictions you mention. This post is closer to hand-waving than it is to statistical inference. It would prove my point about the false seeming rigorousness if you and others believe this is of similar quality to some of his previous work.

I mean it's nice that he actually provides his methodology, but does anyone  believe that multiplying the % white and % liberal numbers together actually tells you the number of white liberals? You shouldn't, likely political affiliation varies with race. To be fair to Silver's point, whites are more likely to be conservative, so he probably feels this is a good enough estimate for Sanders' chances in other states, maybe even too favorable.

Silver even acknowledges the alternative hypothesis about focused campaigning in the early primary states, but then dismisses it with these horrible % white liberal numbers. That's very much like punditry, not prediction. A better analysis might also look at the change in % votes for Sanders over time, in places where his campaigning is underway.

cso96bg,1,t3_3bp695,Phobophilic,"I would make two suggestions if you want substantive or productive discussion of QM or child-theories in a philosophy forum. First, read and edit the spelling and grammar so that it is not so distracting. It became difficult to tell if I couldn't derive a strong point from your post because it was poorly written, edited or explained, or was due to some function of my ignorance.

Perhaps more importantly, read with an eye towards the perspective of your readers. We don't know the contents of your mind, and we may not have all the same background knowledge to understand your usage of any technical terms from a discipline that may assign these terms nonstandard meanings. What this amounts to in practice is something like the following: ""I tell you what position I'm going to advance, I then tell you my position directly, and then tell you about the meaning of the position I just advanced."" This sounds like a ridiculous amount of repetition, but instead of being tired by your pedantic style, your readers will most likely appreciate the walkthrough of your thought process.

As an example, the word ""seems"" creeps into your post too often, and in places where you could put in straightforward argument instead. Such a word is better used to describe the appearance or false appearance of a premise or fact about the world than to stand in for any logical argument leading from premises to conclusions.
