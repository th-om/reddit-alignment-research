There are products available, but this was the first link that came up for my search. My brother has a cat who eats too fast, and this is what he uses. It is good for the cat's brain, and slows them down!",4,0,1443571452,1444731422

cvgjfqx,1,t3_3mmix5,chocolate_enterprise,"I actually really like this theory, but Jo makes it VERY clear in the last book that it is not possible to fix a broken wand. Harry was only able to do so because he had the Elder wand - the most powerful wand ever. But maybe Dumbledore was so powerful by himself that he was able to fix? Either way, u/RoughlyCuboid is right, and you are able to channel your powers through any instrument. So I always assumed he had the broken pieces of his wand. I think it may actually explicitly say that somewhere in the book. If you think about it, Hagrid is about as good at magic as Ron is when his wand breaks. So it could be Hagrid's lack of magical education (I bet Dumbledore would have taught him spells), his use of a broken wand, or a combination.",-2,0,1443411246,1444731422

cvcwcmx,1,t3_3m4y37,chocolate_enterprise,"For the most part, I am fine reading about sounds, but if you get detailed about it, I will start hearing it in my head and freak out a little. If it is a video, forget it, I'm done. I have to turn the sound all the way off. It is definitely worse in person though. 

I think part of why it is worse in person is because you can't actually walk away. I can't tell my friend, ""oh sorry, your chewing is driving me crazy. Bye."" But you *can* close a browser page.",1,0,1443122444,1444731422

cuv51lk,0,t1_cuv4aa0,chocolate_enterprise,"Just having a test would go a long way! I don't believe they retest the elderly frequently since driver's licenses last so long. And maybe also require someone to drive with you for a designated period of time and have them report back to the DMV. That way, you would have someone with a true portrayal of the individual's driving ability report on whether or not they are capable. 

I know that my mother and her siblings have tried to take away their mother's license and she refuses - and she's a terrifying driver. Having the law step in would really help people out who aren't great at handling this kind of situation.",7,0,1441763825,1444731422
