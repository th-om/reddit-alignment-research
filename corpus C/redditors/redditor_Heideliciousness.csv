cv8pr0h,0,t1_cv8mp6r,Heideliciousness,"That's what I mean. We have a shit defense and 0 good position players (other than Forte) that can make up for the loss of Cutler. But really, if Cutler is as bad as a lot of people say he is, why do we suck so much without him? Cutler and Forte are pretty much carrying this team on their back at this point. Without them we are nothing.",7,0,1442809090,1444727626
cv88t3j,1,t3_3lpj94,Heideliciousness,"I think people here are missing the larger point. When we don't have Cutler we look BAD. Really bad. Nobody can deny that. When we have him, we're competing with Green Bay and Arizona. The point is, we shouldn't look this bad without Cutler. That's telling me this team is fundamentally broken.",156,0,1442780580,1444727626

cutifxh,1,t3_3jwo8w,Heideliciousness,"I believe I saw a post on Reddit where some major band member (can't remember who) said he couldn't support the Democratic party anymore because they have become the party of ""shut up and get in line"". And he's truly correct. Since Obama was elected, the Democrats control the narrative in this country both politically and socially. Conservative values are always on the defense. 

On the bright side, this year the Republicans have some real fighters running for President  The answer really is to fight for conservatism, not give into the liberals like so many of the GOP establishment does. ",4,0,1441640791,1444727626
