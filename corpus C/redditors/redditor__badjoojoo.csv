cvswmp5,0,t1_cvsj5fj,_badjoojoo,"Most of what you're talking about has to do with Pashtun culture. Pashtuns are extreme and since it mixed with extremist Islamic ideology that came from Saudi Arabia (Wahabism) , therefore you get two extremes mixed into one weird Pashtun-Islamic culture. 

The whole shitting everywhere thing is because bathrooms don't exist and being lazy is because there are no jobs. You could only actively farm so much. A lot of farming is waiting for crops to grow. 

The killing people who disrespect them is Pashtun culture (Pashtunwali) and rape is Afghan power politics. Warlords and people who are powerful should show their power by having their personal boys for whatever use they see necessary. This is similar to many cultures where boys are replaced instead of adult women. ",2,0,1444336323,1444731602

cvfe91w,0,t1_cvf82nv,_badjoojoo,"Unfortunately, there is no positive outcome to intervening (which is not what actually happened here. It was just a Soldier who used street justice against an admitted rapist). Even if Soldiers were authorized to stop a child from being raped, what would they do with the kid? Do you think locals would do anything to the rapist? No, they wouldn't. People who have their boys to rape are people in power. I'm not talking about necessarily government power, but power recognized by others, so be it a village elder, a warlord, a local politician etc... They will just rape the kid when US forces leave the area, then they will side against the Afghan government for allowing US forces to impose their will on them. ",1,0,1443319101,1444731602
cvfe4ga,0,t1_cvf4x7v,_badjoojoo,"Regardless of what people call it, Pashtuns (not Pashtunis) are not a tribe, they are more  an ethnic group, with tribes within Pashtun ethnicity. Also, bacha bazi is also common through out the northern and central Afghanistan by the Tajiks (and possibly Uzbeks and other ethnic groups, but I'm not sure to be honest). Tajiks are not tribal whatsoever, and power is based on warlordism, not tribes like Pashtuns. 

On another note, the new Afghan government is run mostly by former United Islamic Front (AKA Northern Alliance) warlords (who are mainly composed of Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras), not Pashtuns. All your facts are all messed up. ",1,0,1443318834,1444731602
cvfdxob,0,t1_cvf5wam,_badjoojoo,"LOL, the US destabilized Afghanistan? You obviously know nothing about Afghan history. 

Also, no I do not agree with most of US policy toward Afghanistan, and I don't know what would make you believe that except that you like to assume. ",0,0,1443318442,1444731602
cvf4dkn,0,t1_cvf2tds,_badjoojoo,"First of all, I didn't create these policies, so don't peg it on me. Second of all, most of that post has nothing to do with the rape issue at hand. You do realize that this whole ""boy playing"" has been happening before US intervention, right? This didn't come about from the US intervention. It's also not only police that do this, it's a part of Afghan culture. ",1,0,1443299575,1444731602
cvf2jc8,0,t1_cvf2cky,_badjoojoo,"So what is the military supposed to do? I still haven't gotten answer from anyone. 

I guess the military could stop training Afghan forces, but that also wouldn't stop rape. This issue has nothing to do with carrying out terrorist attacks and what not. They are seperate issues that you are trying to connect together. Afghanistan is in Southwest Asia anyway, not the Middle East.  

Anyway, let's hear the solution.",1,0,1443296137,1444731602
