cvih9rq,0,t1_cvigoah,PacificIshmael,"Wrong. SuperPacs exist due to a separate ruling found in SpeechNOW vs FEC. 

Also wrong about zero disclosure. The Citizens United ruling clearly retains the public disclosure of sponsorship of advertisements requirement as stipulated in BRCA 201 and 311.

cvigcjr,0,t1_cvicegp,PacificIshmael,"You are confusing and conflating a whole bunch of different things. I suggest you at least read the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) about Citizens United and then cruise over the see what the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/aclu-and-citizens-united) says about it. It has zero to do with direct campaign contributions, zero to do with corporate person hood, and little to do with SuperPacs. It has a lot to do with free speech and ""fixing"" it will break the constitution. There are other remedies to money in politics that do not tread on the bill of rights. Again I suggest reading the ACLU page on the matter. ",1,0,1443556188,1444722209
cveebcm,0,t1_cvedktp,PacificIshmael,Didn't even get as far as the FTT (which I agree will negatively effect market and is an aweful idea). Hung up on the idiocy of subsidizing well off families who can afford college. How does an across the board hand out help to lessen income inequality. Seriously made me dizzy. What a colossal waste of resources.,2,0,1443230491,1444722209

Since he has been in the Senate he has proposed 391 amendments of which 69 have passed.  That's 17.6% success, which is a hair lower than Hillary's.

He has definitely said that he thinks there are too many high skilled H1B guest workers in the US and that they are taking jobs away from citizens and undercutting their wages. All untrue. ",1,0,1442605132,1444722209
