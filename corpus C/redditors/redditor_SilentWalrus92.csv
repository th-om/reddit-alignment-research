This came out the year before planes were invented and decades before rockets. They figured that by putting people in a bullet shaped capsule and loading them into a massive railgun that we could shoot them at the moon. They also seem to be unaware you can't breathe on the moon and that there is no life.  ",28,0,1444121495,1444720325

I'd be careful of this sort of thinking. I am not the type to worry that the government is going to become tyrannical, but governments all over the world have a history of overstepping their power and taking military action against their people. Id also like to remind you that back during WWII we forced our own citizens into concentration camps. And granted these camps were not as bad as Nazi camps, US citizens were forced out of their homes at gun point by the US government. People lost their homes, some died, some lost their family. And this is just one example. The US has overstepped their power multiple times in the past. 

> how exactly are these militias, or gun owners in general, going to fight off drones? tanks? planes? etc... Considering death comes from above in this century, the idea that the people could defend themselves against the military is comical

They can't. If the US military decides to turn their guns towards their own citizens then we are all screwed. It doesn't matter if we have fully automatic or semi automatic assault rifles, we're all going to die if the government wants us dead. ",1,0,1443885680,1444720325
