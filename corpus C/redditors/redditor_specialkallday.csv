cvjpnfv,0,t1_cvjks6u,specialkallday,"I'm not entirely on board with the idea of a ""career"" politician being an inherently bad thing. But I do understand and agree with the idea of someone disconnected from the donor/lobby construct to have success. But you also have to look at the candidate that's doing that. Donald Trump isn't representative of the ideal ""grassroots"" candidate free from the aforementioned donor/lobby system. He isn't relevant for his record of public service, or ideals, he's relevant because he has millions of dollars(I'm unsure of his net worth) earned through casino real estate; a flash in the pan industry. His success is not a sign of a healthy democracy in my
 opinion.

cvjg2c2,1,t3_3mzfrd,specialkallday,"Well I think most people on reddit would agree that the lack of debates has been a problem, but I don't know if I would characterize the situation as ""tepid"" or ""solemn."" There's actually a lot of energy, at least on reddit and amongst the younger demographic, for Bernie Sanders (as I'm sure you're aware) and once the debates do start, I think there will be more enthusiasm amongst the democratic party as a whole. Is it good for democracy? I'm not sure it is necessarily either good or bad. Look at the Republican candidates. There are plenty of them, and yet which candidate has the most energetic following? Donald fucking Trump. Is that healthy for democracy? I think the quality of the candidates, the intelligence and awareness of the voters, and the restriction of the money flowing to campaigns are all more important than the quantity of candidates.

cvjfe5h,1,t3_3mzdiw,specialkallday,"When I was like 8 or so, I went to the mall with my mom, and she told me I could get anything I wanted that was $10 or less. I was so hyped. In the middle of the mall, there was a guy selling these helicopters that you pulled a plastic cord on the base, and the helicopter would shoot up in the air. It was getting like 20-30 feet up, almost hitting the ceiling. That was it. That was, at that moment, what I wanted more than anything in the world. We get home, take it outside
. I couldn't do it. I couldn't figure out how to make it work. The disappointment was crushing. My mom tried, she couldn't do it. I felt terrible. I had wasted my mom's $10. The shame was real. I'll never forget it.

cvjd0kk,1,t3_3mz44x,specialkallday,"I can't speak on behalf of all people that enjoy guns/shooting, but personally, the aesthetics of a gun aren't the main appeal of owning a specific gun. Much more important are the things that affect the functionality of the weapon and what I'm using it for. For example the caliber, barrel, sight, are all contingent on the use. Furthermore, the feel of a gun is very important as well. I have a cheaper double barrel that I use for trap shooting because I like the feel of it more than the other shotguns I own. Size is an important factor. Different people with different physical attributes would have different preferences on size. I guess as long as the model wasn't based on your blank-shooting, crooked chode of a cock, it would be fine.
