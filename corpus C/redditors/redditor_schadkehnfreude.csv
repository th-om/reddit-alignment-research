cvu56pz,1,t3_3o5378,schadkehnfreude,"This was the complete opposite of epic, but last week I was playing Xenagos at a 4-person table.  One guy is playing Thada Adel monoblue.  He get her out, islandwalks someone (I think it was me?) and plays my Sol Ring.  Which is fine, that's what you should do.  The mono-green player going after him plays an Acidic Slime to blow up my Sol Ring.  Thada Pact of Negations the Slime.  He can pay for the Pact since he has 5 mana available, including the Sol Ring.
