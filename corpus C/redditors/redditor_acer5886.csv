cvxmm9w,1,t3_3oiluj,acer5886,"I posted this over there too. Honestly I just left the clan because I started seeing you becoming so crazy about this issue. I'd been enjoying it since it started, played in a lot of games with clan mates etc. But being so focused on kicking people out is off putting. I was getting tired of seeing clan message every day telling people to message you for people that are bming. No one is perfect, I doubt even you are. The point is to try and be better. None of the clan messages have focused on this.

It's one thing to be a friendly clan that's trying to be BM free, however, it's another thing to ask the entire r/smite subreddit to tell on other players.

Thank you for confirming my decision to leave the clan was the right one.",1,0,1444698831,1444727243
