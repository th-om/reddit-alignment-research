cvwsv26,0,t1_cvwfn2k,ClaraOswinOswalt,Perhaps they could turn into one of the Shifter races from the [Eberron](http://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/UA_Eberron_v1.pdf) UA. That would let them take a certain trait of Werewolves that appeal to them (str or dex or speed or tracking) while still being a relatively wotc-tested character. ,1,0,1444647928,1444718972
cvw26m8,1,t3_3obuts,ClaraOswinOswalt,"The Angry GM has a pretty solid [article](http://theangrygm.com/ask-angry-building-a-mystery/) on running a mystery.  

Some of his advice will be tough to write into this bottle episode/orient express scenario you're proposing, like pulling them off the mystery if they're missing clues.  

Start by coming up with a few different possible narratives for the sabotage (i.e., insurance fraud, political espionage, revenge) and a means & motive for each. Then tie those into the NPCs on board (the quiet chemist's brother died under the Captain's previous crew; the captain is in serious debt and mobsters are onboard forcing him to sink it). Then come up with clues that would exonerate the innocent parties (treatise of nonviolence in suspect's room, Captain hangs himself in quarters and leaves note, etc.)",2,0,1444589722,1444718972
cvsvn5w,0,t1_cvstl0q,ClaraOswinOswalt,"That's a good read on that. I interpreted those stances as a way to shift the dialogue off of email servers and onto things dems might actually care about.  

I guess I just don't see tactically why she would care about Sanders. To get the nod, it seems like he would either have to blow her out of the water on favorability, or beat her on favorability and either finance or endorsements. People talk about her ""repeating 2008"", but it's not like she imploded, which is what would have to happen for Sanders to pass her in either of those metrics. ",1,0,1444334913,1444718972
cvsuvrv,0,t1_cvsu55k,ClaraOswinOswalt,"I really prefer ""Raucous Caucus"" as a visitor of this sub termed them. It's slightly more apt. ",5,0,1444333838,1444718972
cvsti2x,0,t1_cvsopjx,ClaraOswinOswalt,Does Hillary really care about the primary? Either the wheels completely come off her campaign or she gets the nod. I assumed she'd use the stage as a way to talk to Dems in Ohio and Florida.,1,0,1444331840,1444718972
cvstaqz,0,t1_cvss049,ClaraOswinOswalt,"That is a solid point. If Bernie's supporters think Hillary is sincerely against the TPP, she might be able to turn them out in the general.  

But even if Bernie takes a swipe, I doubt Clinton will bite. She'll just talk right past him to the Dems in Ohio and Florida.",2,0,1444331534,1444718972
cvssowb,0,t1_cvssfvz,ClaraOswinOswalt,"yeah I got sick of saying ""Freedom Caucus."" I admit labeling them as Tea Party is a bit of a misnomer, but I was looking for something close to a synonym.",1,0,1444330629,1444718972
cvss5ec,0,t1_cvsr01m,ClaraOswinOswalt,"*On paper* he seemed like a great way to bridge the Establishment Rs and the Freedom Caucus. In reality I don't think a bridge is politically viable. 

The GOPe doesn't *really* have the numbers to push through legislation. They can't even get their team captain voted in. They need the TP to play ball, and those guys aren't keen on compromise. And the more the Freedom Caucus plays hardball, the weaker the establishment looks.  

I expect they'll stonewall until one of their ranks has the gavel. In the meantime, any Rep who thinks they improve their standing back home by looking like they're taking a hardline against the Dems and ""Washington as Usual"" will think long and hard about defecting to the Freedom Caucus.",8,0,1444329836,1444718972
cvsqzqw,0,t1_cvsq22o,ClaraOswinOswalt,"It might. She's sort of been cultivating the whole ""reserved statesman"" vibe, though. If her handlers decide she needs to look more aggressive going into the general that's what she'll do.",4,0,1444328166,1444718972
cvsq05p,0,t1_cvspptl,ClaraOswinOswalt,"eh, Hillary objectively gets nothing out of even acknowledging the other candidates exist. Sanders is going to have to use the stage to sell viewers on his policies. O'Malley and Webb really should be coming out with knives drawn if they're serious about a nod, but it's honestly a lose-lose for them because it could make them look petty.",8,0,1444326738,1444718972
