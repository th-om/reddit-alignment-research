cvpjg16,0,t1_cvpikhd,dblcross121,You should definitely check them out then.  I'm pretty similar size to you and always had the problem of finding a suit jacket that fit my shoulders but wasn't a billowing sale around my torso.  ,2,0,1444090883,1444723687
cvpi1tn,0,t1_cvphew3,dblcross121,"Personally I couldn't be happier with the suit I have from them.  I'm planning to buy a couple more actually.  

I've found that different labels definitely fit differently.  For example, the J. Crew Ludlow suit (which you'll see get recommended alot around here) just didn't fit me well at all.  The cut was all kinds of wrong apparently for my body type.  Suit Supply's cut is just perfect for me.  YMMV.",1,0,1444088398,1444723687

If you're on a budget, check out the ""tall"" sizing at Old Navy and J.Crew Factory.  Only downside is that tall sizes are usually only available online, I've never seen them in stores.
