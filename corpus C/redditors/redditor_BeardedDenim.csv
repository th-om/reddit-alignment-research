cvvvglr,0,t1_cvvv4ug,BeardedDenim,"I think it's actually explained in the definition of [calorie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie):
>The large calorie, kilogram calorie, dietary calorie, nutritionist's calorie, nutritional calorie, Calorie (capital C) or food calorie (symbol: Cal) is approximately the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. The large calorie is thus equal to 1000 small calories or one kilocalorie (symbol: kcal).

So, if I'm understanding this correctly, lets say you drink 1 liter of 4.4 C (40 F) water. Your average body temp is 37 C (98.6 F), so we need to raise that liter of water by 33.4 C. So then you would burn 33.4 Cal in order to bring it up to temp. ",6,0,1444578477,1444719877
cvrws7n,1,t3_3nwe1g,BeardedDenim,"Heres a good bit of detail on the origins of the word from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_(word))

>The word witch derives from the Old English nouns wicca /ˈwɪttʃɑː/ ""sorcerer, male witch"" and wicce /ˈwɪttʃeɪ/ ""sorceress, female witch"". The word's further origins in Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European are unclear. Old English also had hægtesse ""witch, fury"", whence Modern English hag, of uncertain origin, but cognate to German Hexe, from an Old High German haga-zussa, Common Germanic *haga-tusjon- (OED), perhaps from a *tesvian ""to mar, damage"", meaning ""field-damager"" (the suggestion of Grimm). The element hag- originally means ""fence, wooden enclosure"", and hence also ""enclosed fields, cultivated land"".

And the more modern phrasing:
>The Middle English word wicche did not differentiate between feminine and masculine, however the masculine meaning became less common in Standard English, being replaced by words like ""wizard"" and ""warlock"". The modern spelling witch with the medial 't' first appears in the 16th century. In current colloquial English ""witch"" is almost exclusively applied to women, and the OED has ""now only dialectal"" for the masculine noun. Figurative use to refer to a bewitching young girl begins in the 18th century,[14] while wiche as a contemptuous term for an old woman is attested since the 15th century. ""A witch of Endor"" (alluding to 1 Samuel 28:7) as a fanciful term for a medium appears in 19th-century literature. The meaning ""an adherent of Wicca"" (male or female) is due to Gerald Gardner's purported ""Witch Cult"", and now appears as a separate meaning of the word also in mainstream dictionaries.

However it might be best to investigate the origins from [Wicca](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wicca)
>A twentieth-century representation of the Old English wiċċa, from Proto-Germanic *wikkô ‎(“sorceror”). The modern use of the term was introduced first as Wica in Gerald Gardner's Witchcraft Today (1954), as a collective noun (""the Wica"") allegedly used as a self-designation by practitioners of witchcraft who initiated him in 1939. The spelling Wicca, again as a collective noun, is first attested in a letter to Gardner from his friend Margaret Bruce, dated 23 February 1960. 

And for the historical refrence of the terms, and possibly the actual answer to your question, look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology_of_Wicca) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft)

>Witchcraft (also called witchery or spellcraft) broadly means the practice of, and belief in, magical skills and abilities that are able to be exercised individually, by designated social groups, or by persons with the necessary esoteric secret knowledge. Witchcraft is a complex concept that varies culturally and societally, therefore it is difficult to define with precision and cross-cultural assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious, divinatory, or medicinal role, and is often present within societies and groups whose cultural framework includes a magical world view. Although witchcraft can often share common ground with related concepts such as sorcery, the paranormal, magic, superstition, necromancy, possession, shamanism, healing, spiritualism, nature worship, and the occult, it is usually seen as distinct from these when examined by sociologists and anthropologists.",2,0,1444262342,1444719877

cvmy5l3,1,t3_3nc5cj,BeardedDenim,"Part of what I have seen is that people are taking the 'right' to ownership as a separate component to the 'privilege'. 

As an American, I have the right to own a gun and defend my home, but as a citizen, I have the privilege to fill out the right paperwork, do the correct training, and should have to prove that I am of sound mind and body to continue the right in using my gun. That's my responsibility as a gun owner in a democratic society. If my household has members that do not meet that criteria, then as a responsible owner I should consider proper precautions or other security options. When those options are not taken as the owner, and disasters happen, the owner needs to be held just as responsible. On that same token, I need a guarantee that those options are available to all gun owners. Whether that is proper safe and locking options available at ease, or mental health options available for my children or other housemates, I need options to continue taking advantage of my 'right' as long as I have the 'privilege' to do so.
