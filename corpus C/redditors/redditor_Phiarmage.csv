I'll see you at the vending machines in the hotel and at the closest convenience store getting Doritos and some backwoods.

Key word: *indirectly*.

>At least 99.5% of their income (or something like that) ends up going to great causes. 

I'm not necessarily talking about what their income goes to, Bill Gates still is heavily invested in Microsoft (e-waste, pollution from manufacturing phones, pollution from extracting raw materials), while Buffet is invested in the fossil fuel industries.  They profit off these industries. 

>I'm just trying to point out that the ""billionare class"" isn't completely horribly. I'm not sure what destroying it for its own sake really does. Instead we should just limit their influence on the political process and limit their impact on the environment through regulations.

They aren't completely horrible, they're people just like you and I. I agree, they shouldn't have as much political influence, and I don't think it matters if someone is extremely rich- it's what they choose to do with their money is what is of concern.
