The ""35% want to repeal it poll"" that TexasWithADollarSign linked to (and that I linked to earlier), was based on the following question:

> What is your opinion of the health care law?
> 1. It should be repealed (35%)
> 2. It may need small modifications, but we should see how it works (51%)
> 3. It should be left alone (12%)
> 4. Not sure (2%)

[Link to poll](http://images.businessweek.com/cms/2015-04-19/150417_final.pdf).  By contrast, most of the polls that ClockOfTheLongNow linked to have a more binary question.  For example, the [Quinnipiac poll](http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=1774) used the following question:

> Do you think Congress should try to repeal the health care law, or should they let it stand?
> 1. Should repeal it (49%)
> 2. Should let it stand (43%)
> 3. Don't know / not sure (8%)

So the extent to which Americans favor repealing Obamacare depends on what question you ask them.  A plurality of Americans favor repealing it when presented with a binary choice, but when presented with a compromise ""wait and see/small changes"" option this becomes the favorite.

So what can be gather from this?  I think there are two things the Republicans ought to take away from this:

1. The American people are skeptical of the Affordable Care Act.  Five years after it was passed, it still does not have the sort of broad support that Medicare and Social Security have.

2. The American people are in favor of compromise.  Though their overall opinion of the act is slightly negative, they would rather see the act fixed than scrapped, and they'd like to give it time to prove itself.

So what should the Republicans be doing right now?  They should be *proposing improvements* to the Affordable Care Act.  They need to figure out which parts of the act they find the most egregious and pass a bill that fixes those while leaving the rest intact.

Alternatively, if Republicans are *sure* that they want to scrap the act on the long run, then they're going to need to hold off on that until they have the power to do it.  That means either that they need to wait until they have the presidency and both houses of congress, including a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, or they need to convince enough people that the act is bad that some of the blue-dog Democrats are unwilling to support a Senate filibuster.

In the meantime, there's no point in fighting over the act right now, because Republicans don't have the power to do anything about it.  Instead, they should try to pass some bills that have broad public support that Obama would be unwilling to veto.  From a partisan point of view, this would have the advantage that Republicans would actually have influence over some legislation for a change, and also it couldn't hurt the Republican party to try to establish a reputation as the party that gets things done in congress.

For example, browsing the [Republican platform](https://www.gop.com/platform/), I see lots of things that the Republicans could work on that have broad enough support that Obama would be hard pressed to veto.  Among them:

1. The [""Restoring the American Dream""](https://www.gop.com/platform/restoring-the-american-dream/) section has portions on rebuilding home ownership in this country, improving our decaying infrastructure, improving workforce training, and decreasing the unfair advantage that big unions have in the workplace.

2. The [""Reforming Government""](https://www.gop.com/platform/reforming-government/) section has parts about regulatory reform, protecting internet freedom, restructuring the U.S. Postal Service, and increasing accountability for how the TSA treats travelers.

Other sections of the platform have similarly popular things that the Republicans could be working on.  These are the kinds of things that the American people want congress to be doing, and congress's decades-long refusal to deal with basic issues of governance is why congress's approval rating [stands at 15%](http://www.gallup.com/poll/180113/2014-approval-congress-remains-near-time-low.aspx).

So instead of blocking all legislation to make a quixotic stand against Obamacare (or Planned Parenthood, or whatever issue Republicans are mad about but have no hope of doing anything about), maybe it would make more sense for the Republican congress to *actually govern*.  There was a time in this country, not too long ago, when Republicans were thought of as the serious party, the party you could trust with the levers of power because they knew what they were doing.  That's the mantle that Republicans need to reclaim if they want to get the American people on their side.",2,0,1444421609,1444727608

cv4ow5a,1,t3_3laser,jimbelk,"9/11 was so huge and massively unprecedented that most people don't really think it's fair to blame Bush for not preventing the attack.  He certainly wasn't blamed for it during the 2004 election, and Kerry didn't even try to criticize him for it.

I mean, it's clear that the attack could have been prevented by the Bush administration (or the Clinton administration) in various ways, but terrorism just wasn't really on anyone's radar in a serious way before 9/11.  It's hard to imagine now, but ""terrorists attack New York"" was thought of as more of a movie plot than something that might actually happen.  Of the three presidential debates during the 2000 Bush-Gore election, the word ""terrorism"" was used exactly once.

And I don't think it's related to Bush being a Republican.  If a huge [geomagnetic storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm) suddenly fried the power grid for the most of the continental United States, I don't think anyone would really blame Obama, even if it came out later that his administration had ignored requests to increase funding for more safeguards.
