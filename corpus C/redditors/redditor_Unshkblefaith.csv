Therefore it is easy to meet demand. With prostitution the product is people, and more importantly people who are comfortable with selling their bodies for money. That supply is far more inelastic than the supply of alcohol.",0,0,1444527964,1444718024

The proxy war has already started with  Russia directly attacking the forces that we are training and equipping. Russian forces have also been radar locking and flying dangerously close to our aircraft as a way of asserting dominance in Syria. Sure they want to help maintain Assad's control over Syria but it is also cleat that this is yet another challenge to what they see as the American hegemony.",1,0,1444495479,1444718024
cvuvxum,1,t3_3o6flp,Unshkblefaith,I find it highly unlikely. I think that they all realize that Hillary will be the nominee at the convention. To harp on the email scandal in the primaries will only help to legitimize the arguments that the GOP will make in the general election.,3,0,1444494954,1444718024
cvuhayz,0,t1_cvugiye,Unshkblefaith,"What worked wonders for the Republicans in 2014 was a combination of:

1. Terrible rollout of the ACA

2. More Democratic seats up for grabs in the Senate

3. The lowest voter turnout for a federal election in over 70 years

The Republicans didn't win because they shut down the government. If anything it caused more moderates to shy away from them and vote for Democrats. What did work out for the Republicans was the ridiculously low turnout among Democrats. If the Republicans shut down the government again I can guarantee that Hillary will be president and that the Democrats even take back the Senate. The GOP has a lot more seats to lose this year than the Democrats, and you can sure as hell bet the Democrats will turn out in force in a presidential election year.",3,0,1444448092,1444718024
cvu7r5r,0,t1_cvtpg73,Unshkblefaith,The the most generous estimates of voter breakdown by affiliation give the GOP 41% of voters. That means they need to convince another 9% of voters to their side even if every registered Republican voted. Do you think they can do that by shutting the government down when the same action ranked there favorability among moderates a couple years back?,1,0,1444428990,1444718024

As much as I am a proponent of nuclear power its fundamental flaw is that it cannot be easily ramped up and down. Nuclear reactions take a lot of time and energy to ramp up to critical mass and peak energy production. This is why nuclear plants are used for base load production and supplemented by gas plants and renewals which have comparatively fast, or even near instant, ramp up times.",4,0,1444320702,1444718024
