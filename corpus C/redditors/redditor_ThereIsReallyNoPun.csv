[I took the](http://canada.isidewith.com/results/1407768690) canadian Isidewith quiz.  ([link](http://canada.isidewith.com/) if anyone wants to take it). Interestingly, I got 87% NDP, 81% Liberal, 21% conservative, but when I actually read through your link, I liked the Liberals a lot more than the NDP, and didn't dislike the conservatives too much.

cvwmhrx,1,t3_3odisr,ThereIsReallyNoPun,"I'm a Clinton supporter, and I tepidly support the TPP. I'm sort of disappointed by her turn against the TPP, but honestly, it just looks like pandering. After she gets into office, she'll probably back reasonable trade agreements, so I'm ok with it. I would rather have her take a firm stance FOR the TPP and then debate the fuck out of Sanders/O'Malley in the upcoming debate, but I guess I can't have everything in my politician of choice.",2,0,1444624951,1444720524

cvty1we,0,t1_cvtxog3,ThereIsReallyNoPun,">Trade can increase churn as production moves elsewhere, it doesn't translate in to structural unemployment though. Its another example of disruption vs displacement.

If we only look at a single nation, how is US autoworkers becoming obsolete not an example of structural unemployment? (Skill mis-match)",2,0,1444413882,1444720524
cvtugjt,0,t1_cvtm684,ThereIsReallyNoPun,">Syrian refugees are fleeing to Europe in search of a better life. If you were President, would America help take some of them?

I like that, especially as a question to democrats. Will they pander to labor's fallacious view that immigration=lower wages, or will they shill for big Econ?

I'd probably ask something similar. ""As President, would you work to make the immigration process easier? Would you increase quotas to allow more people immigrate?""",4,0,1444408539,1444720524
cvtu1pi,0,t1_cvtpj20,ThereIsReallyNoPun,">That argument at its core usually devolves into a lump of labor argument.

Yeah I'm trying to avoid that. I like free-trade, and so does the guy who was making this argument. My question is whether this argument (More reliance on capital industries --> lower reliance on labor --> lower enployment), necessarily commits the lump-of-labor fallacy, or other bad econ. 

>There are more powerful forces, like SBTC, that would drive the matching problem between labor demanded and labor supply anyway.

Yeah, I (and the guy who was making this argument) wasn't really disputing this, or the fact that MP will most likely offset any job loss/gain, or the fact that welfare gains from lower prices will be greater than any losses from temporary unemployment. We're just sorta nit-picking on the claim some people make that free trade always means more jobs.",3,0,1444407918,1444720524
cvtnjcg,1,t3_3o3arn,ThereIsReallyNoPun,"So more international trade means more specialization. For developed nations, where capital plays a bigger role compared to labor relative to developing nations, specialization means further embracing these capital intensive industries. I've heard people use this line of argument to say the United States expanding trade would necessarily decrease aggregate employment. Is the argument bad economics?",6,0,1444397344,1444720524
