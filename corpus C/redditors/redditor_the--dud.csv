cvuv7vn,1,t3_3o5zgz,the--dud,"As a secular Buddhist many of the things Scott says are views shared by myself. I lost my mother to a brutal battle against cancer a few years ago.

It really is wonderful to think of the near-infinite space and time of the universe. A chaotic mess that can be so beautiful and profound. You don't need to believe in an ""afterlife"" because everyone already ""exist"" forever. The atoms that make up your body is constantly replaced without you noticing. In fact it's impossible to identify one elemental particle (for instance an electron) from another. In one instance an electron that is part of ""you"" could have previously been in the brain of Einstein another instance, or in Charlie Manley's left big toe last week, or a long time ago it could have been a part of a gigantic super nova explosion.

In my mind once you die the only thing that changes is your consciousness is lost - you and the world can't interact directly anymore. In this vast fluctuating universe all the particles (trillions upon trillions) that has ever been ""a part of you"" will continue their journey through time and space. ""You"" always have and always will be a part of this beautiful near-endless time and space, but for the shortest moment of time you have a consciousness so make sure to appreciate every moment to the fullest.",6,0,1444493605,1444731794
