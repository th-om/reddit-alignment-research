cvuu5uu,0,t1_cvurwkg,Standupaddict,"No this is an awful argument . Skt is the only team to successfully swap players mid season, every other team failed at it . Western teams has disadvantages but the fact that they don't swap players mid season is not a reason for their failings.",0,0,1444491509,1444725969

cvu514j,0,t1_cvu3lyf,Standupaddict,"Probably would be too hard. You have 4 people jockying for time on the mic. Three is really nice because if monte/deficio/jatt says something about the game another color caster will hop in and give their 5 cents. Having three people doing that would require a lot of coordination to not talk over each other. If Jatt says something that Monte and Deficio disagree with they'll both try to rebut after Jatt is done with his thought. 

It would be cool if they pulled it off but It would be a hell of a feat. I think they tried once and it wasn't that great. ",1,0,1444424469,1444725969

I feel like people are really nostalgic over Joe and Deman. ",15,0,1444424161,1444725969

cvrjzx1,1,t3_3ntvhk,Standupaddict,Balls really hasn't been playing super well. Hes doing a good job but hes not #2. He was a non factor in 2/3 of C9's games (due to how Cloud 9 was playing strategically).,1,0,1444242597,1444725969
cvrjvkq,0,t1_cvrh9bs,Standupaddict,If you want to pull out the super long record then monte is pretty fucking good. He was right with the vast majority of predictions in Season 3 and 4 worlds. ,1,0,1444242422,1444725969
