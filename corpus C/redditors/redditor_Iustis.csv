cvxayjd,0,t1_cvxao4i,Iustis,"In addition to disliking that it would override the pre-existing systems,  I have a couple problems with it.

In general I do not like untargeted dividend type systems, I would much prefer (as a last choice probably) money that would be used in that way to be put into directly paying off debt/a sovereign wealth fund).  Ideally I like it going towards related causes, like carbon taxes going into a fund that invests in infrastructure/transit/renewable energy.  Or at least a more efficient system like reducing income taxes correspondingly (as BC did).",1,0,1444680841,1444723159
cvxasx8,0,t1_cvx8lz5,Iustis,"I don't know, I kind of like the idea of it but I think the pass should be used sometimes.  It is not uncommon to see say two CPC policies coming from a similar philosophy compared to each other (like oppose legalization and more funding for crack downs on grow-ops).  In that type of situation you either have to pass or ridiculously choose the issue that would have the smallest impact in your mind.

I would say try to avoid it, but don't be completely afraid or you get odd results.",3,0,1444680618,1444723159
cvxaiia,0,t1_cvx9owr,Iustis,"It is obviously an argument that can be made.  The problem is that a coalition government means both the NDP and LPC have to explicitly endorse each piece of legislation, whereas in a minority the opposition is usually given a bit of a pass on letting the odd piece of legislation through even if they don't like it by finding a compromise.  In a coalition they might not be able to find a compromise that both parties are willing to stamp with their name, so less might get done.

It also could be worse for the NDP: while they get some power and influence (although they arguably would get a similar amount via an opposition role with the power to give confidence or not) they *lose* the power to actively critique the government and run against them in the next election (not literally, but I mean campaigning against them as they have against Harper).

It also might cement the LPC as the de facto party of the left since it is a kind of endorsement that they are fairly close to the LPC (and separated from the CPC).  A lot of NDP votes come from the sentiment behind ""Liberal, Tory, same old story"" or ""campaign from the left, govern from the right.""  Those narratives would take a big hit in a NDP-LPC coalition.",12,0,1444680205,1444723159
cvxa4cs,0,t1_cvx8ixw,Iustis,"While the Greens seem to favor MMP they actually have a similar official position as the LPC:

>It is the only voting system that allows a minority of the votes to elect a majority government with 100 percent of the power. It makes voters feel as if their vote just doesnâ€™t count. It is time to replace it.

>The first-past-the-post voting system has lost the confidence of Canadians. Our promise is to replace the first-past-the-post system with a form of proportional representation within the first year of the next Parliament. We will determine the form of proportional representation best suited to Canada through extensive public consultation by an all-party committee.",1,0,1444679643,1444723159
