cvvvo4o,0,t1_cvvv9td,The0bviousNinja,"Uh a sbc is what (most likely) came in this car from the factory.  Only reason I went that route.  Guy above says chevy guy. I said chevy motors hold a LARGE chunk of the market for performance cars. They are the first motors people think about swapping into most cars. When people hear a ""motor swap"" the sbc or ls os the motor people generally think of as the swap. 

No projections. Just stating. Look at the amateur drag racers... even the mustangs have ls swaps...

Brand loyalty can be idiotic but be honest. The sbc and the LS are the most stable, common, and moddable motors on the market. Both chevy. And both motors cover a hefty majority of the performance market",-2,0,1444577773,1444731886

cvsmj0p,0,t1_cvslrw8,The0bviousNinja,"Ok, Again, Watched the budget issue for a year, all information available on local news, national media hears ""DMV closings in black belt"", all information buried. 

I dont have a full workday to go find this stuff for you. It was more of a WAKE UP AND PAY ATTENTION so that I dont have to do it. 

All that being said: 

http://www.dmv.org/articles/alabama-to-close-31-drivers-license-offices/

that is the link from DMV showing that the centers that were closed account for 5% of the licences in AL last year, and the closings do not effect you unless you are getting a new AL license/taking the test, moving INTO AL, or renewing a license that you got suspended.

As for the 4 independent studies WHNT and WAAY in Huntsville reported on it in Feb and June. I don't have time to go find it. figure it out yourself.

cvsl3t8,0,t1_cvskbg5,The0bviousNinja,"I cant post the video of the black sheriffs and state troopers talking about it, It only aired last night and the news station hasn't uploaded the video to the only place I know to look yet. but sure Ill come back with it when I see it.

Try googling the issue, tell me how many sites are talking about how bad it is that its the ""black belt"" taking the most hits. As though they understood what the ""black belt"" was named for (coal rich areas, not racial populous) 

I have been watching the budget issues for a year, and heard all of the ""indepenent study stuff, and the minute the national news got wind of it, all of the facts are buried under piles of this stuff.

Long story short, Ill give you this:

[Heres the link to what Bentley says about it](http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/10/gov_bentley_says_decision_to_c.html)
Clearly states it will effect only those who are getting first time AL licenses.

As far as what you need a ID for, use your head. [And don't buy the hype for the hype sake.](https://youtu.be/GaqV9vVP2Yc)
