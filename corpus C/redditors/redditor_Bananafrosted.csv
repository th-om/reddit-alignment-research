cvv6rau,1,t3_3o7s9v,Bananafrosted,"are you upset that CSGO is on FSN? if that's the case its simple. FSN thinks that enough of it's demographic will want to watch CSGO. thats why they did it. there are no politics surrounding that decision about ""what is a sport"". all they know is that they will make money doing it. 

your argument of the definition of sport. you are assuming that FSN determines the definition of what a sport is. many people maye have idfferent ideas of what a sport may or may not be.  just because a corporate definition of sports is upsetting you. i would say it shouldnt. 

you are being petty about the hard definition of sport. when in reality its not very important since a sport is more of a thing people do to have fun or engage in in a SPORTING way with each other. and to get very dicatator-y about its defeinition is sort of useless since its not important in the sense of like being politically correct or maybe legally being importnat. its just not. 


another thing: none of your arguments follow any logical sense. it seems like you have a bad idea of sorts of things like fat people on the couch. but having a video game on a sports network doesnt follow in any of your arguemtns",1,0,1444514890,1444731770
