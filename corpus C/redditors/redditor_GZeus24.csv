You are correct in one part in that I was conflating the buying of special treatment for carried interest with capital gains treatment - not the same at all.  Can I assume from your comment that you are in favor of eliminating the carried interest exception?

I also note that 15% is higher than the rate for the majority of taxpayers because the majority do not make the money - income distribution is out of kilter.  The 'majority' is a disingenuous comparison point.  Getting taxed at 13% on 50k is not comparable to getting taxed at 15% on millions in annual income.

For understanding your POV, do you believe that all taxation is theft of property?",2,0,1443087918,1444724832

Genuinely curious here...can you show me a manager who lost all of their personal wealth when their fund went south other than fraud, i.e. please make visible one of these failures?",4,0,1443067360,1444724832
cvc7hww,0,t1_cvc65p9,GZeus24,"A legitimate scenario (deferred income/reinvestment by choice) that does create a problem....however, its a bit of a unicorn / joe the plumber scenario.  Could it happen?  Sure.  Maybe to one person every 10 years but its more of a pipe dream than reality based argument.  

However, it is a very poor rational to justify the current system where thousands of people are paying incredibly low tax rates on incredibly high incomes simply because they had enough money in the first place to buy a law that declares their income as 'special'.

None the less, how about an exemption for single proprietorships held more than 10 years?  Add an exemption for single homes owned more that 10 years as well and you can avoid catching people who bought the family home in an up and coming area.  Fair exemptions are easy to add as long as they target average people.  

Could exemptions like this solve your objection(s) or is it more a philosophical objection?

Edit: On second thought, ,maybe its easier to just change what is a cap gain as proposed by the OP rather than create a cap.",2,0,1443066291,1444724832

This is more than enough for most regular people (house sales, stock holdings, just plain good fortune) to reap the benefits that are intended from the exemption without allowing for a lifetime of low taxes just because of your job like Romney.  Throw in carried interest while you are at it.",2,0,1443062107,1444724832

cunv7zn,0,t1_cund07t,GZeus24,"True, but Romney still got the nomination.  His real problem was he didn't bring any states to the table with him so he couldn't offset his lack of base appeal.  

If Kasich can get the nomination (as the establishment replacement for Bush) then his electoral map positives begin to outweigh his negative of being unloved by the base.

Add Rubio as VP and they win Florida and dilute the Democratic advantage with Latinos everywhere putting other states in contention.
