I mean, yeah, some people have that opinion and I don't personally agree with it.  Still, the a woman generally isn't forced into incubating a child in the same way I'm not forcing into digesting hamburgers.  I basically agree with you, but your statement is loaded in a way that is dishonest, so stop with that.",1,1,1444708582,1444727065
cvxrjb9,0,t1_cvxrbf8,Lalagah,"Uh, no?  That's like saying a law against throwing up forces me to digest hamburgers.  If you eat hamburgers, digesting them is generally part of the deal.  Pregnant women made a clear choice that resulted in getting pregnant.  Stop being an idiot about it.

I'm pro-choice, but the lack of consideration here for responsibility is ridiculous, really.",1,1,1444706568,1444727065
cvxqsmi,0,t1_cvxq81d,Lalagah,"Uh, no, it's not forced unless it's rape.  I'm pro-choice, but aborting a healthy child is ethically, well, not the greatest thing I've ever heard of.  Can you defend it without saying it's forced incubation?, because it's clearly not.",0,0,1444705344,1444727065
cvxlvqr,1,t3_3ogkll,Lalagah,"Well, I'm pro-choice, for one, but most of the pro-choice people make me sick.  Almost no one pro-choice will concede that they are ending a human life.  It's fucking ridiculous because that's literally the definition of what an abortion does.  There is a lack of respect somewhat on both sides, but also a huge lack of honesty on the pro-choice side.  It's no wonder religious Conservatives get pissed.  I'm even pro choice and I get pissed about it.",1,0,1444697705,1444727065
cvx8ycb,0,t1_cvx74af,Lalagah,"I don't consider it murder (unlawful/wrongful killing), but yes, it's ending a child's life and I think that's sometimes legitimate.

In nature a lot of animals might do something similar for various reasons, normally after the child is born though (which I also think should be ok).  It's a normal instinct in some situations.  Other times people are just being selfish and don't want their child, but I'm not going to judge too harshly.  To each their own or at least to the extent that I think this should be a legal practice.",1,0,1444677983,1444727065

Once it's in the oven it's a cookie for all practical purposes.  Yes, there are some ways it won't become a cookie, one of those being pulling it out of the oven early as you've just done thinking you're being clever.  Yes, it was clever, but it doesn't fool anyone.  Now you're grounded.",3,0,1444670659,1444727065
cvx3hi2,1,t3_3of7i5,Lalagah,"You're missing something I think.  I'm pro-choice and agnostic btw.

Is this a question of right and wrong or a question of legality for you? The two are entirely different.

People skirt the issue, but an abortion is killing a human, straight up.  It is usually a shitty move.  However, I think it should be legal for the mother to do so because there are legitimate reasons for it, including family planning.  It's not black and white.  You can think abortion is generally wrong but also think it should be legal.

Mom: ""Don't hit your sister"" 

You: ""I didn't hit my sister, I threw a ball at her"", etc.  


Relevant example:

Mom: ""Don't eat the cookies"".. puts cookies in oven.

You: takes cookies out of oven and eats one.  ""It wasn't a cookie it was cookie dough"".

Mom: ""No, it's a fucking cookie, not a POTENTIAL cookie.""",0,0,1444668723,1444727065
