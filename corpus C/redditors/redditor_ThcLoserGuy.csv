cvilzy6,0,t1_cvil3kz,ThcLoserGuy,"Good question. I'm not exactly sure how much child care is. I know my sister has used a private owned daycare to watch my niece at times. The one she used was 10 dollars a day per child. This was a small ran daycare out of one's home, I'm sure the larger ones cost more. As far as healthcare, Indiana offers the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) to low income workers. I was just having this discussion with a co-worker the other day. I believe she said she paid less than 20 a week for it. I couldn't tell you what all that covered or what kind of deductible she pays. ",1,0,1443564328,1444721009
cvijubp,0,t1_cviijs5,ThcLoserGuy,"To be fair, 150,000 for a house is pretty expensive for most places in the Midwest. I live in Indiana and me and my wife are currently looking at a 3 bedroom, 2 car garage, and fenced in yard property that's listed for $49000.
