They wouldn't be successful by that definition since luck is essentially a zero sum game and there would be much more turnover in the financial services industry. Financial services mega giants like Goldman, JP Morgan, Citigroup, etc that consistently post profits don't do it by luck. That would be a dangerous business formula.

>Why should intelligence play a part in determining who pays taxes? 

It shouldn't, you missed the point. You're basically saying: More hours manual labor > fewer hours of skilled stock trading. 

Just because you've worked fewer hours of stock trading work does not mean you should be taxed more as you're doing a more intellectually demanding task.

>Q: Are alcoholics covered by the ADA?

>A: Yes. While a current illegal user of drugs is not protected by the ADA if an employer acts on the basis of such use, a person who currently uses alcohol is not automatically denied protection. An alcoholic is a person with a disability and is protected by the ADA if s/he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job. An employer may be required to provide an accommodation to an alcoholic***. However, an employer can discipline, discharge or deny employment to an alcoholic whose use of alcohol adversely affects job performance or conduct.*** An employer also may prohibit the use of alcohol in the workplace and can require that employees not be under the influence of alcohol.

Part in bold, I would think, gives Haden an out.

Which goes back to the original point. A union would be pointless if they just allowed the NFL to indefinitely suspend players. Take a look at deflate gate. Even if there was 100% conclusive evidence that Brady cheated, the NFL still abused their power in handing out the punishment. If Greg Hardy was a convicted domestic abuser, and Goodell handed a lifetime ban, then it really is irrelevant that they're defending Hardy at that point.",2,0,1444664846,1444717364
