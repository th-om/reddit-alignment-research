cvxwekz,0,t1_cvxftz4,imjustyittle,"Yes, it's clearly based on a Congressional investigation. This first story could be me, the details match so closely.  Few people except affected veterans seem to know about this. Maybe I need to write an article, somehow draw attention to how the overburdened , unorganized  V.A. is reacting to political pressure...

cvwe0ot,1,t3_3oc92f,imjustyittle,"Thank you for posting this. It's something more people need to know.

I have a question, if you don't mind. But I get it if it's too personal.  I just wondered what it's like for you during the seizure. Are you aware of what's going on around you? Is it like when you're dreaming? Is it painful?

Again, thank you for sharing.",4,0,1444609043,1444727061

cvthr3s,1,t3_3nyhtz,imjustyittle,"Last Friday the V.A. refused to refill the oxycodone prescription I've been on for over 12 years for back problems (old break), previous bilat mastectomy/reconstruction (frequent pain), etc. They gave me a muscle relaxer instead, but it tears up my stomach. I told them this isn't working and they've added an anti-inflammatory, and gabapentin.  My regular doctor's on active duty until December.

Up right now with awful back pain.  And I'm furious because she said that I was making too much out of my pain.

Their reason? 'We're being looked at very closely for all the pain meds we write for veterans and we're cutting everybody back. '

cvq9vsg,1,t3_3nn40k,imjustyittle,"OP, what a horrible thing of them to do! I'm so sorry you had to go through all that!

A few questions, if you don't mind. Please excuse me if any were asked before.

Did you have anything with you in the trunk?  Flashlight?  A single water bottle or can of soda?  Food besides potatoes?  Were you fed together with your siblings at mealtimes (when they weren't gone)  and was it 'regular' meals?  Are or were your parents religious people?  Do you have any idea where they went off to?  Did you have any pets during this time of your life?

What they did was definitely abuse, and I congratulate you on escaping it and for seeking therapy!  I am proud for you!",5,0,1444151530,1444727061
