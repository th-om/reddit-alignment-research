The third from the bottom (through the window, the guy with the belly) was fantastic. Also really liked the others, very cool photos.",1,0,1444676465,1444731552
cvx7kro,0,t1_cvx6i21,eisberger,"It sure was surprising for me. At least for the people I know personally who know and like Adorno / Horkheimer, most of them also have a positive opinion of Israel (or at least don't buy into the ""Evil Empire / child-murderers vs. noble freedom fighters""-dichotomy).",1,0,1444675987,1444731552
cvx7db4,0,t1_cvx6cg5,eisberger,"Oh you mean they could've had an interest in going through a more detailed fact-gathering process (as opposed to just throwing a suspected dissident in jail) because it could bring up other names, too? Did I understand that correctly? If yes, that might actually be true... someone in jail just costs money, if you keep him / her under close scrutiny on the other hand, you might be able to get to know who they work with etc.",17,0,1444675685,1444731552
cvx57x9,0,t1_cvx2d0x,eisberger,That's a fair point if you're talking about an environment with something resembling the rule of law. The GDR regime didn't need waterproof evidence if it didn't want someone expressing their opinion... they could pretty much just put them in jail if deemed necessary. ,27,0,1444672588,1444731552
cvx54bm,0,t1_cvx1g2m,eisberger,"""The EU"" is a gigantic complex of agencies, political bodies, organisations, just a vast number of very different people with very different ideas about how things should be run. She is *one* person from *one* of the bodies that make up the EU bureaucracy (although admittedly one of the most important ones). Saying that every one of the thousands of people working for the EU doesn't care about serving the people and she just happened to spill the beans about that is bonkers - just look at how many delegates in the EP were *against* TTIP (and of those who are in favor of it, many assume that it's in the best interest of Europeans - which you and I can disagree with, but that doesn't mean they don't care).

cvx4per,0,t1_cvx1z5r,eisberger,"Okay, not *no* context, but two sentences which is way too little in my eyes. What kind of interview was that? He surely didn't ask her *just* that, why is nothing else from that conversation given to the reader? At least that one answer she gave... I can't really believe she only said ""I don't have a mandate from the people"" and then nothing. She probably has some kind of idea about why TTIP is supposed to be positive for the EU.

Again, I most probably would not agree with that, and I do believe her role in the negotiations isn't positive, it's just that the article is a bit quick to make her look like a completely paid-for puppet for my taste.",0,0,1444671858,1444731552
cvwxr1c,1,t3_3og7v7,eisberger,"""Stabbing"" in quotes, oh wow. And isn't there enough video and photo evidence of these guys wielding knives and hurting people to make the use of the phrase ""alleged Palestinian attackers"" factually false? How many cases are there from the last few days in which there's actual uncertainty about wether or not the ones who were shot wanted to stab someone?

EDIT: that last question wasn't completely rhetorical btw, are any of these cases unclear / disputed? I remember that one video of the woman being surrounded by police and then shot, people argued over whether she had a gun or a cellphone in her hand.",3,0,1444660782,1444731552
cvwxn1f,1,t3_3ogc9o,eisberger,"That's a chilling statement of course and I'm not going to defend it or the TTIP process in general, but that article is still problematic (keep in mind that it's an opinion piece, the Independent calls this section ""Voices"").

It's all constructed around this *one* sentence she said to the author. No context, no explanation how that was meant, not one sentence she used before or after that one. I'm pretty certain there was more to the conversation than that.

And what she's saying is also *technically* true (again, I'm not defending that, just pointing out) - the Commission doesn't have a direct mandate from the European populace, that's what the Parliament is for. The Commissars are appointed by the governments and *approved* by the Parliament.

All that aside... the attitude this sentence represents is pretty screwed up.",27,0,1444660577,1444731552
cvwwurj,1,t3_3og7aa,eisberger,"Really depends on how you'd eat your last meal... I'd think of very deliberate, slow, savor-every-bite-style enjoyable eating. That's not how you become obese, I think there's even scientific work (too lazy to do the googling) on how you actually eat more if you don't fully concentrate on eating because you watch TV or do something else at the same time.",2,0,1444659080,1444731552
