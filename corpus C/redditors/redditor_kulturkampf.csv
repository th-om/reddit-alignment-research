cvxy0et,1,t3_3ohofl,kulturkampf,"I think it would be accurate to say that Christianity follows the trend of every single major religion: a sense of stoicism. It believes that the true and good things in the world are not pertaining to our material or physical indulgence, but rather that they come from a mastery over ourselves. 

Thus, sexuality outside of that which is within a marriage that serves a clear social purpose & is a building block of our society is frowned upon. ",1,1,1444724029,1444725214
cvxxzd9,0,t1_cvwud16,kulturkampf,"That's right. 

I assume our treaty with Morocco involved cooperation with the barbary coast stuff; I seem to recollect it. You know, they're both berbers after all. ",1,1,1444723905,1444725214
cvxxxw3,0,t1_cvxeeko,kulturkampf,"Minimizing suffering has a lot to do with control of our urges and mastery over desires. 

In a sense liberation is gained through self discipline. 

Buddhists, Chriatians and Muslims seek liberation through controlling urges, not indulging them, and your characterization of Christian morality as merely following edicts is wrong.",1,1,1444723734,1444725214

Technology and its development and use are all theit own separate fields of discussion and debate, i think.",1,1,1444723359,1444725214
cvwtkzn,0,t1_cvwrx5q,kulturkampf,"Right, that is very nice; but that has never meant that the American and Moroccan people are fundamentally similar or have come to a truly impactful understanding. 

After all, 'Islam' and the US have not exactly had a pleasant 15 years in spite of our secular governments doing well. 

Of course, Morocco is famously secular. But still... You get the point. A random agreement with a Secular sultan.

Perhaps it also served some political expedience in ruffling feathers with the Spanish -- who we would have inevitable clashes with concerning Florida and Cuba. But IDK. I thinkt he whole premise of this is something you are reading too far into. ",1,0,1444650619,1444725214
cvwtj3b,0,t1_cvwt8a2,kulturkampf,I think that perhaps some of my vehemence has transferred over from the idea that someone else is presenting that the Morocco / US treaty of friendship truly has been some barrier breaking pledge of tolerance with the US... ,1,0,1444650430,1444725214
cvwrv7l,0,t1_cvwi12r,kulturkampf,"Right, so how is that even relevant? They signed a peace treaty to end the Barbary Coast wars which were about Muslims capturing random Americans (& Europeans) and selling them into slavery.

cvwrude,0,t1_cvwma04,kulturkampf,"How is that even possible? None of the states in North Africa are even theoretically the same on any level except maybe... Morocco ccan claim some connection because their royal family is the same?

And I would like to say: may you be blessed & the war be resolved in a way favorable to the Syrian people soon. 

Peace. ",1,0,1444612338,1444725214
