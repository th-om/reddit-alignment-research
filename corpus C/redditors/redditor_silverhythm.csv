cvmbxsb,0,t1_cvmblwg,silverhythm,">Then why is it that we have most of our gun crime in highly dense cities where the strictest gun laws apply?

Because there are more people there? But really, because the idea of searching anyone who enters a fairly small, densely populated region that has chosen to enforce gun control laws (like, say, Chicago) also draws the ire of strict constitutionalists. No matter that they can just hop over to nearby rural, gun-loving Indiana to get what they need. It's really sad to me that 2nd amendment advocates, by sticking their head in the sand, are undermining 4th amendment advocates.

As to the rest of your off-topic rant, yes. I think the law of the land is fair game for questioning and criticism, and yes, I do think that many (most, in fact) have devoted fewer resources to informing themselves on public policy than I have. Sue me for self confidence. And I assure you, I know plenty of the rules surrounding gun ownership. I'm a legally sanctioned blind carrier in the state of Indiana.",1,0,1443834061,1444721655
cvmason,0,t1_cvm91g4,silverhythm,"Stop thumping the constitution like overzealous Christians thump the bible. The drafters of that document were alive 200+ years ago and had a fraction of the intelligence and information the educated among us has now. Permitting every piece of shit that achieves citizenship somehow to possess a tool that can kill dozens in minutes without any sort of oversight or vetting processes is the height of idiocy by every objective measure we have available. End of story.

There have been nearly 300 instances of gun homicide in the U.S. in 2015 involving four or more fatalities. So I really don't give a shit about your irrelevant data from the early/mid 20th century. The cultural demographics are so different now, particularly related to population density,  that it is not a worthwhile contribution to the discussion.",0,0,1443831652,1444721655
