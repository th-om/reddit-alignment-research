Also disarmament has been a major topic in every nuclear state at one time or another and could easily become one again.",6,0,1443917885,1444719571

cuoyxem,0,t1_cuov2zi,waterbluesky,"Rural America. Good times.

Dont get me wrong. I have seen many people handle their guns with the respect that they deserve and never put anyone in danger. But there are the fucktards that drink with loaded weapons and generally do really stupid things with them. ",1,0,1441254459,1444719571
cuoyo4n,0,t1_cuotego,waterbluesky,"Most stadiums, convention centers, and exhibition halls are paid for in part by direct tax payer money or tax breaks. Not that broad or over reaching of a statement.

Ya I moved on from people that shot at me when I could but its not always the easiest thing to do. But beyond that these people still own guns and I would really rather they did not bring their gun to a crowded event and drink.

No you really didnt give an answer but thats ok.",-3,0,1441253830,1444719571
cuoshck,0,t1_cuoouw3,waterbluesky,"1. There are lots of tax payer supported venues out there that have events that ban guns.

2. Its not irrational. I personally have almost been accidentally shot twice and only for a fortuitous obstruction probably would be dead now. I have also personally witnessed a lot of stupidity with guns some resulting in injuries. So quite possibly rare but not irrational. 

But why does public land automatically equate to must allow guns always?",-9,0,1441241915,1444719571
cuony9j,1,t3_3jeci8,waterbluesky,"Ok this I dont get. Generally the pro gun community is ok with private stores/individuals banning guns from their property. You are even ok with private gatherings like the NRA and Republican political ones baning guns from their events. But somehow a private ticketed event, which is briefly using public land, has expressed the desire for guns to be prohibited is just a step to far? Is it the fact that its being legislated thats the problem? Or would you still have a problem if the orginizers of the events posted ""no gun"" signs at the event?",-6,0,1441233439,1444719571

ctnzu00,1,t3_3feltm,waterbluesky,"The Soviets played a major role in defeating the Germans but there is a very slim chance they would have been able to do it without the supplies provided by the US. The same goes for the British. So while the US manpower might not have been necessary, particularly on the Soviet front, the manufacturing capabilities producing planes, guns, trucks, food, boots, clothing, and so on was crucial to the war.",9,0,1438445762,1444719571
