That isn't mutually exclusive with disagreeing with her policies, which Bernie and most of his supporters also note. Having said that, the rabid fans of Bernie (not supporters of Bernie) will continue to hate Clinton but be less vocal. ",1,0,1444695262,1444727044

If we as a species converge with AI and rationally decide we can seek knowledge and interact without our meat suit, aren't we just discontinuing a vestigial organ? No pain, no suffering, no loss of freedom - just removal of an unnecessary organ like an appendix. Is it really all that ominous?

cvv0z68,0,t1_cvuu89g,l00pee,"I think what is overlooked, even by hawking but more so by the doom sayers in general is that it is highly unlikely that we'll have AI overlords. What is much more likely is our desire to leverage the power of AI and augment ourselves. There will be a convergence of human and machine. Now, this may have dire consequences as well if the augmentation allows someone to cause the world population to submit while the cyborgs fight for power, but on the other hand, the more people that are augmented, the more likely we are to find a peaceful equilibrium until we decide our biological vessels are obsolete. Yes, humans may cease to exist, but not because we are defeated, but because we choose to evolve to pure machine. And who knows, perhaps recursive AI will conclude that biology is most efficient and create DNA that introduces 'natural' AI.",2,0,1444504204,1444727044
cvtv0sm,0,t1_cvttdh0,l00pee,"Why is there ALWAYS an assumption that because you can point out the biggest problems in government that the knee jerk response is ""Oh, clearly there's no issues elsewhere!"" Do you know how fucking stupid you sound when you say that? I mean, glue munching, slobbering, punching yourself in the face stupid.

OF COURSE the democrats have issues. I could name several, but they aren't destroying their party and avoiding governance based on a 2000 year old book of ignorance. We can't even get to the issues because of these idiots trying to project their god and short sighted ideas on a congress that doesn't support them - in either party. Unless you are one of them, it's obvious where the main (not solitary) source of the issues are. Want to get congress moving? Get religion out of government. A second grader can look around the world and see where there's a theocracy, there's a failed country.

EDIT: Of course there's downvotes, but no response. The situation is indefensible but you're mad that someone is saying it. Yes, the democrats have the fringe left where there's tons of crazies. You know what the dems don't do? Let the crazies sabotage congress. So point your fingers, project, and by all means, certainly never look inward. If only the republicans were self aware instead of doubling down of dumb fuckery.",-2,0,1444409391,1444727044
