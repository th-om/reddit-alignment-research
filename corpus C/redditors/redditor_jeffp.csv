Right, so Honest (the landowner) got arrested for not having a lion quota. Because if he did have the proper permit, he could have allowed a hunt right on the border of his land and the national park.

Your cited reg strengthens my point.  ",2,0,1444704915,1444725409
cvxq55j,0,t1_cvxpytk,jeffp,Your cited reg says nothing about baiting. I wasn't debating the legality of hunting in a national park. And there is no fence on the border between the national park and Honest's land - so saying he baited specifically for that lion and not another animal is a stretch and impossible to prove. ,2,0,1444704287,1444725409

But staying in Africa, lots of villagers do not like the wild animal populations. Lions eat the animals they hunt and other villagers, elephants stamped their crops ... And to these villagers there wasn't always an economic price tag on them that's why the species became so low. It wasn't until governments subsided farmers to allow animals to be hunted on their land did we see a recovery. ",2,0,1444702960,1444725409
cvxp1yf,0,t1_cvxovcw,jeffp,Yes hunters impact non game species. Cougars in NC and habitat restoration for bald eagles are two quick examples. ,1,0,1444702603,1444725409

Sportsmen bankroll conservation, from taxes on hunting and fishing equipment, license and stamp fees, and contributions from conservation organization to the tune of $3 billion a year.
