cvxr020,1,t3_3oj2p4,Nonsanguinity,"Essentially, the GOP has evolved into two fairly well defined wings that no longer play nice with one another.  

There's the establishment, country club republicans, who are very moderate on social issues and just want the government to get out of their way when it comes to business and finance (and also for no one to hold them accountable for their excesses/oopsies).  People who swing this way can pretty much run for President by cozying up to one or two of a growing number of the billionaire class, and, once they've found their patron, can leverage a statistically insignificant shot at the presidency into more money and power in the increasingly permeable membrane between government and the private sector. 

Then  you have the Tea Party, who are the heirs to the Dixiecrat mantle - the ones Nixon wooed with the Southern Strategy.  Their hatred of centralized government goes back to the carpetbaggers, and they're starting to see that the former group of ""moderate"" republicans will not hesitate to abandon the TP's hallowed ""social issues"" once election season is over.  And post-recession, they're feeling slightly less upwardly mobile than they used to, and anything that smells even remotely like government is going to get a share of the blame.  So there's plenty of people who are willing to capitalize on this anger by donning the ""patriotic rebel"" mantle and hoping their hot air is going to fill this new power vacuum.

I think even the most ardent liberal can admit that a group of black men open carrying  through a white neighborhood carries certain connotations that would make different people uncomfortable for different reasons. I'm not putting any value judgment on this fact but I don't see the use in really denying it because, as you say, these implicit social  biases exist regardless of how we feel about them.",1,0,1444418701,1444717071

cvt50g5,1,t3_3nzs50,Nonsanguinity,"Well - though you're not asking for states, Kansas and Wisconsin come to mind, as far as economics, and then North Carolina is a prime example of the damage a right wing General Assembly can do to absolutely wreck primary and secondary education,  social programs (ie. legal aid) for the poor, and the environment in the matter of only a few years.

As for cities, I think small towns like the one I grew up in are pretty good evidence of the destruction that right wing policies wreak on the poor and middle classes.  What was once a thriving main street has been almost entirely supplanted by Wal-Marts and Family Dollars.  Textile plants shuttered so that Vietnamese children can make them in unsafe conditions.  The good jobs have either left or been undercut by the rich leveraging economies of scale.  The result is the gradual deconstruction of the middle class, and increased stratification between the different classes.

cvt14gi,0,t1_cvt0o6q,Nonsanguinity,">Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), was the first case where the United States Supreme Court ruled that a law that is race-neutral on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner, is an infringement of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Basically, there was a law related to laundromats in San Francisco that was totally neutral on its face.  But, in practice, it was enforced 100% against Asian immigrants.

So the court struck down that ordinance:

>The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Justice Matthews, found that the administration of the statute in question was discriminatory and that there was therefore no need to even consider whether the ordinance itself was lawful. Even though the Chinese laundry owners were usually not American citizens, the court ruled they were still entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Matthews also noted that the court had previously ruled that it was acceptable to hold administrators of the law liable when they abused their authority. He denounced the law as a blatant attempt to exclude Chinese from the laundry trade in San Francisco, and the court struck down the law, ordering dismissal of all charges against other laundry owners who had been jailed.

It doesn't make an assumption of race.  It controls for income and then finds a racial disparity.  This is one link in the chain of the argument for supporting disparate impact litigation.

>It's dismissal because nothing in the article shows anything race related beyond ""black families are disproportionately poor"".

That's one possibility.  There are certainly others. Perhaps it's being [administered in a prejudicial manner like in Yick Wo?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yick_Wo_v._Hopkins)  Like most things, we won't know until we examine the issue.  Simply dismissing it as race baiting is not the best course of action.

>I see a problem with poverty being a sinkhole and would address that. Blaming racism does what to solve that? 

Why not both?  You were all too willing to throw out the validity of the entire article for simply *mentioning* race. I don't see how that's productive toward any of your stated goals.

Poverty is obviously a problem, and it intersects with race in lots of ways that are sometimes hard to see.",3,0,1444328345,1444717071
