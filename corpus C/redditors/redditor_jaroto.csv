So, among players 24 and younger in the league this year, Rosario's BB/K ratio is.... [0.12, dead last](http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=400&type=1&season=2015&month=0&season1=2015&ind=0&team=0&rost=0&age=14,24&filter=&players=0&sort=6,d) (i.e., he's got some room to grow...). 

The usual suspects are at the top. Harper (.98) and Panik (.90) are outstanding. Machado (.63), Betts (.58), and Trout (.57) all round out the top five. ",8,0,1443303598,1444727525

cva383u,0,t1_cv9va9c,jaroto,"Thanks. I thought about the afflictive/nonafflictive distinction (e.g., I thought about Dukkha, but that's afflictive or a hindrance), but for it to really map onto emotions, it would have to be a concept that really captures the full spectrum (with all emotion being normal, but potentially problematic--depending on how they're handled). 

It's equally interesting to me that there might not be a distinction in Buddhism. Clearly there are some differences between thinking and feeling, but I'm interested in how they're the same (and Buddhism might suggest you can't have one without the other). ",1,0,1442924099,1444727525
