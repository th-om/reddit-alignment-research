1 How to take information in
2 What should I be learning

I found make it stick to be great I got one very good trick that really helped me and that was to make a set of questions when I go over material. Then answer these questions the next day the next week and the next month.

This does two things it makes me pay attention and keeps me engaged and the recollection helps it stay in my head.

cvou5nr,1,t3_3ng4o7,lpn-nl,"Without going into too much detail but trying to go to the founding ideas of the two political parties. First you have to assume that half the country isn’t stupid and evil so you can look at things a bit more logically, try to see if through others eyes, people who have different beliefs and reasons to yours.

First the two main problems, money and the media.
1 Any politician needs an incredible amount of money to become elected,some estimates put fundraising at 70% of a governor's time, add to that how much time he must spend repaying that debt and you are left with how much time they can work for the good of the country.

2 The media focuses just on things that are simple to understand and make you emotional, explaining complex ideas in an even hand way does not draw viewers. Viewers care more about divisive things politicians may have said than policies, they want to be right and have their belief reinforced.

These two things are destroying politics which is why it all looks  like a big joke. However to try to  help you understand why half the country are such morons I’ll explain the core belief of the two sides and show you some examples of how you can use this to interpret current divisive issues.


You have a conservative liberal split in the US which at the core disagrees on a very fundamental question when it comes on how to improve society.
The liberal idea is ‘for a person's potential to be fully reached he needs the help of society’. The conservatives thing is ‘for a person to fully reach their potential they need institutions and a lack of barriers’.  There is no right or wrong to this problem some people can want the best for society and think one way and vice versa.


So let’s take those two simple things and look at some issues and hopefully you might see why people disagree.(these are ideals of course there are people in  both camps who are greedy sociopaths or just want to see society go bad, these are just philosophical arguments)

1 Welfare:
Liberal:  People are not born equal so it is upto society to address the needs of the people who have little most often through no fault of their own, society has enough so it should provide enough for the greater good  of all.
Conservative: If the government provides for too many people it starts to cause imbalances, people generation after generation become reliant on welfare and do not then manage to pass down the skills  that get people out of this situation, they call this a welfare trap. 

2 Taxes:
Liberal: Wealthy people did not earn every penny of their wages they benefit from a stable society provided by schooling young, police, courts, sewerage. So they should pay back into society at a rate they can afford. If we improve the lot of the poorest the whole country benefits and the easiest way to do this is tax and redistribute.
Conservatives: The government is incredibly wasteful, I work 3 days out of 5 for the government and get virtually nothing back due to the high overheads and inevitable corruption.It would be much better if we give to those causes we agree with only to charaties who are doing a good job. 

3 Obama care.
Liberal: Health care is a basic human right should not just be provided to those lucky enough to be well off, what about children of the poor what did they do to deserve to suffer?
This is so important it should not be in the hands of companies who only care about profit.
Conservative: Everything the government does in comparison to the private sector it does badly, I should be able to choose if I want to spend my money on insurance or not, I should also be able to choose a health care provider and let them compete for the best service,after all it is my health. All we are doing is taking a bad system and adding government incompetence.

4 Big business:
Liberal: Companies only care about profits and will put profit above society, look at oil companies and wall street. You need a strong well funded government to counterbalance large companies.
Conservative: The big government role is what corrupts the markets and companies, if it wasn’t for the government being in bed with them bad companies would fail smaller companies could compete, it is the big government that protects these companies with my tax money.


You see it should come down to do you think people should pool more resources into a central pool that takes care of us all but is involved in more things, telling us more what to do. Or do you think the government should stay out of our business allowing people to succeed without blocking them but also fail without helping them.",1,0,1444048644,1444719427
