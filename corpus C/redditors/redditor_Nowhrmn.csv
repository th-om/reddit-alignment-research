Try talking to the person you're talking to instead of the ""broader context"".

> Love when people like you try and make everything into ""anti-Semitism"" and then get upset when people make jokes about ""they think everything is anti-Semitic"".

I'm secure in my knowledge that you're an anti-Semite. We've discussed it before. You dislike pro-Israel Jews more than you dislike pro-Israel non-Jews. You make posts like:

> You've been watching your tay-sachs afflicted relatives for too long that it's imprinted on your brain.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/3o3mbu/i_am_embarrassed_to_be_an_arab/cvug7c5)

That's enough for me. You're an anti-Semite.

> There were no ""wars of annihilation"" in 1948 or 1967.

So Israel wasn't going to be destroyed upon an Arab victory in 1948 or 1967? Let's see your historical sources on that.

> You try and claim that ""the Arabs"" wanted to try and repeat the Holocaust

Nope, I didn't.

> and then you turn around and say that the Israeli victory over totally unprepared Arab forces ""proves"" the ""inferiority"" of the Arabs and that the Israeli Jews are supermen.

Never did that. I do admire the courage of the Israeli army in both wars, though.

> The Palestinians face greater adversity in this context and they survive.

Well, yeah, what else can they do? They're not allowed to assimilate in other countries. They can't just vanish into thin air.

> Lies and idiotic canards trying to deny Israeli meddling and obstruction of the Palestinian economy aside

Didn't make any.

> to pretend that Israel would ""do just fine"" all on its own if it were really and truly isolated from the rest of the world circles back around to that idea that you want to try and push about Israelis themselves.

Didn't claim that. Since when does a country have to be totally self-sufficient to be successful? 

> Talking about what Israel did, does, will do. Not your personal views-- although I don't really believe you when you deny as much,

Whatever. It's not like I think there's anything I can say to change any of your views.

> But it explains it. It shows you the rationale for the events, besides the knee-jerk brutality that the IDF and the ""settlers"" display to the Palestinians that they encounter as part of the occupation.

It explains it to an extent but it doesn't justify it.

> I also find it impossible to sympathize with Israelis who want to deify each and every one of the handful of killed Israelis in the West Bank or due to rockets from Gaza while at the same time negating the reality of Palestinian suffering at Israeli hands.

I know. You find it impossible to sympathise with any ""pro-Israel Jew"", no matter what happens to them. Your views are well established.

> The Jews running around the compound with their IDF thugs is just the cherry on top of the shit sundae, so to speak.

Al-Aqsa is inside internationally accepted Israeli territory. Getting pissed there are Jews inside is either anti-Semitism (hope I didn't trigger you) or radical Islamism.

> If you want to ignore all the other reasons-- particularly when it comes to the expansionist project and the casual abuse perpetuated by the IDF-- for the situation, then I can't stop you from doing as much. Just don't have to tolerate it.

I'm not ignoring the other reasons. Palestinians have a right to violently resist security forces. They don't have a right to use violence against non-violent civilians.

> Go back to writing for INN with that kind of thing. You're not ""righteous"" or ""victims under perpetual threat"" here.

Sure, and you back to Electronic Intifada, you brave mujahideen. Or nationalist, if you insist.",1,1,1444718939,1444720736

Israel exists. That's a victory. It wasn't destroyed in 1948 or 1967 when all the odds were against it. There's plenty to brag about in continuing to exist, and, indeed, thriving.

Of the views imputed to me, let's see which ones I hold:

> Abusing all the Palestinians in the West Bank because you can, when you can, will never bring you peace.

Not this one.

> Trying to fudge reality and history through pretending that Palestinians ""don't real"" will never bring you peace.

Not this one.

> Making it plain that you hold Palestinian life in general to be worth less then Jewish life, and putting that way of thinking into action will never bring you peace.

Not this one.

> Carry on pretending that the ""settlers"" killed this month outstrip in terms of heinousness the thousands of Palestinian non-combatants willfully or through callous carelessness killed by Israelis.

Getting warmer. The fact that Palestinian non-combatants died in the past and some of those people were killed as a result of Israeli criminality doesn't justify this new murder wave.

> Carry on pretending that the Palestinians demonstrating or attacking ""settlers"" and IDFers now have no legitimate grievances.

Some of them have legitimate grievances. The ones killing over Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is many of them, do not.

> See where it gets you.

We will. Israel won't surrender.",1,1,1444717000,1444720736
