And to improve the matches in HL, you don't need to change the algorithm at all.

All you need to do is have stricter requirements for being able to play HL.

1. Needs to have at least 10 heroes at level 8.
2. Needs to have at least 2 of each role among them.
3. Has played every map at least 5 times in QM.
4. Has won on each map at least once in QM.
5. Has won with each of his heroes at least once in QM.

Seriously, the biggest problem with matchmaking is that it is possible for people with no understanding of basic game concepts and mechanics to get ranks with a few lucky rolls of team mates and opponents.",1,0,1444668354,1444726310

I could go into s long rant about the differences between natural currencies and monetary currencies now. But I'm gonna spare you that and just say: natural currencies are ruled by the laws of nature, which cannot be tampered with and don't need much enforcement. Monetary currencies are ruled by special interest bullshitting and enforced by government violence.",0,0,1444498936,1444726310

cvuwxd1,0,t1_cvuwel1,imbecile,"And then you think about it a little further and realize that asking ""How will I pay for food without money?"" in a capitalist society where governments by violence and banks by bullshitting hold down the masses;  
is pretty much the same as asking  
""Who will I pray to for rain without God?"" in a feudalist society where kings by violence and churches by bullshitting hold down the masses.

Once you realize that money, just as god, just ceases to exist when people stop believing in it, you can see how to move past it and build a society without it. History is as full of currencies no one believes in and uses anymore as it is of deities no one believes in and uses anymore.

Sure, in today's society you gotta act as if money is real and important, else you will be persecuted by the full force of the law and no one will trust you.  
But it is not that long ago, and in many regions it is still that way, that even people who don't believe in any god have to act as if it is real and important or be persecuted by the full force of the law and not trusted by anyone.",35,0,1444496816,1444726310

cvnolu5,1,t3_3nc4i4,imbecile,"Reliable convenient contraception is probably the most important and game changing invention mankind has made so far. It means we can break out of the Malthusian trap we and all other life have been caught in since the beginning of life: all life quickly replicates until that replication is limited by the scarcity of some resource. Which means there is always scarcity of some resource for all life.

Being able to rationally control birth rates means we can control population without having to rely on horrendous child mortality rates (with right out baby killing being a normal part of many older or primitive cultures).

What improved child mortality and contraception combined mean is, you don't need half of the population to care for children only to have 50-80% of the children die before adulthood. What a tremendous waste of life and time and effort and productivity.

This simple fact that women don't need to give birth and parent 10 children to have 2-3 survive into adulthood is the single reason women can even afford to look for different roles in society. And frankly it is a duty to look for different roles and contribute in different ways. Motherhood does not consume all your time and energy anymore.",3,0,1443959823,1444726310
