cvgicoh,0,t1_cvgbw0p,sonnybobiche1,">Another thing, the whole basis of this lipid peroxidation is assuming that the lipids are on the outside of the coffee bean, actually exposed to air. Is that correct? Where are the lipids actually located within the bean?

Yes. My casual understanding (I'm not at all a coffee guy and I can't quite remember how I stumbled onto your conversation) is that the oils are brought out to the surface of the bean by roasting. Normally they are within the bean, forming the endosperm (the equivalent of the yolk of an egg).

>Honestly, the negligible amount of lipid that is oxidized when I expose my beans to air for maybe 30 seconds every day is almost negligible, in my opinion.

Yeah, in those 30 seconds it's virtually nothing. The problem is all the time it's sitting in the freezer. I don't know how long it would take to noticeably affect the taste, but I would guess weeks, not months. Especially if we're talking about a rather dodgy freezer that's changing temperature all the time to avoid ice buildup.

All that said, freezing obviously doesn't cause *more* oxidation than storing at room temperature. **If you were to make aliquots of your beans and store them in the deepest part of the freezer, it would certainly improve the shelf life dramatically.**

The problem is most people would put it all in a single jar and take it out of the freezer every morning, open it, scoop out what they need, and put it back. Then it's not oxidation that's going to make the beans rancid; it's hydrolysis. The condensation that forms on the beans every single time they get a nice hit of warm, moist air is going to be a solvent for the acids in the bean -> acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the fat. This happens much, much faster than peroxidation, and it's why you generally try to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.

>Your body uses O2 via hemoglobin in the blood.

That's right, it carries O2 *in a very controlled way* to oxidize fats/sugars to CO2+H2O and get the energy out. The inside of a cell is kept a very reducing environment, otherwise all the molecules of life would be oxidized as soon as they formed. Even then, it's not perfect, and stuff gets oxidized constantly. Most of it gets tossed out: the skin is shed, the hemoglobin gets broken down and shit out (that's what makes poop brown). For things we can't replace, like neurons, there are elaborate mechanisms in place to try to repair the damage. Still, it happens constantly -->  aging, cancer, etc.
Reactive oxygen species are no joke!


Thanks for the trip down biochemistry lane. Might come in handy on upcoming exams.

cvga90b,0,t1_cvfheqx,sonnybobiche1,"I'm sorry to say you're wrong on this. Polyunsaturated fats decompose very readily in the presence of oxygen and/or light, and any college organic chemistry student could draw out the mechanism for you. Moisture causes additional decomposition via a different mechanism.

This is basic organic chemistry; it applies to any (cis)polyunsaturated fat, whether that was made by a coffee plant or a car wax manufacturer. The reason your body doesn't decompose right now is because it creates antioxidant compounds and constantly regenerates/repairs oxidized molecules. Dead people don't do that, which is why you'll find that corpses lose their freshness rather quickly.

>let's not forget that the coffee beans are frozen. Meaning the bonds that make up the lipids within the coffee bean have been hardened.

sort of... what you really mean to say is that these reactions are temperature-dependent. It's certainly true that they are slowed by freezing temperatures. In my old lab we used to store lipids (in single-use containers) at -80C and they would keep for months at least. But your freezer doesn't do -80C, I am sure of that. It's probably closer to -20C, and that makes a huge difference.

The other problem is that every time you take them out of the freezer to use some, the rest develop condensation, which as I mentioned acts through a different mechanism to cause breakdown of the fats (acid-catalyzed hydrolysis).
