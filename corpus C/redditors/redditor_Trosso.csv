cvvp3aw,0,t1_cvveu1s,Trosso,"The NHS already is involved with a huge number of private companies (including the company I work for) - The NHS is essentially just being mismanaged by the chief execs and board when they're striking up deals with these private companies. these companies produce the drugs and equipment and software that is used throughout the NHS.

I can't guarantee anything, as each Trust negotiates their deals with private companies however the theory is that the more competition there is when trying to sell a product to the NHS, the more competitive and innovative these companies are in trying to secure contracts with the NHS.

I also want to point out that while I now work for a private company, I did work in the NHS for 2 years in Safe Staffing so I am well aware of the pressures clinical staff find themselves under. I have the deepest respect for all clinical staff and I wouldn't be supporting this if I didn't think it would be beneficial to the NHS.",-2,0,1444559998,1444726030
