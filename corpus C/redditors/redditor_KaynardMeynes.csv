cv9lw7g,0,t1_cv8q4gw,KaynardMeynes,"Obama won in 2008 because he won the African American vote by a huge margin, which gave him the edge he needed along with his wide support among other groups to beat Clinton. Sanders will/has hit a ceiling because he doesn't appeal very far outside his base of white progressives.

There's a reason phrases like ""Clinton Coalition"" or ""Obama Coalition"" exist, and it's because these people have broad support among many demographics. Sanders doesn't have that, he has committed support mainly among one demographic. That's not what wins elections.",1,0,1442879226,1444731094

cuwanvv,0,t1_cuw8ffn,KaynardMeynes,"I'm not sure if you misinterpreted my comment or if you're just being willfully dense, because it seems like you responded to a comment that I didn't make.

First, I didn't say that they weren't funded in the ""next budget.""  I said that they're currently funded, as in they are currently receiving federal funding.

Second, I didn't say that the budget process isn't a legitimate channel to adjust the budget.  I said:

>Holding the government budget hostage to change something that already exists strikes most people as an illegitimate way to change policy.

Meaning that if Republicans have the votes, they can either repeal the part of Title X that gives federal funding to Planned Parenthood or garner enough votes to pass a budget without that funding in it by offering Democrats something in return.  At a certain point though, an offer can become ridiculous.  Saying to Democrats ""get rid of this funding that's existed for the past 45 years and we'll let the government function"" doesn't strike people as legitimate because ""the government"" consists mostly of people and things who are totally unrelated to this debate.  There are levels of legitimacy, and some processes are more legitimate than others.  If this type of channel is reasonable then we've set a pretty low bar.

Edit: Looking through your post history, I see that you pretty regularly engage in insulting the people who disagree with you and some fairly ridiculous hyperbole.  Probably not going to respond again after this, but I can honestly say that your response to my comment makes sense within the context of some of the other things you've posted here.",2,0,1441848842,1444731094

cutts3b,0,t1_cutn7tj,KaynardMeynes,"Generally free trade agreements are thought of as solutions to humanitarian problems, because they usually improve the lot of impoverished countries so much.  Sanders has a record of opposing free trade deals because, from his website, they ""kill American jobs by shifting work overseas to nations which fail to provide worker protections and pay extremely low wages.""  

I've already addressed the low wages part, but the ""kill American jobs"" part is also wrong.  Critics of free trade deals generally give numbers of lost jobs that are small fractions of the total labor market (NAFTA's opponents always said 500,000 lost jobs - less than 0.5 percent of the labor market at the time).  But the fact that these numbers are such a small portion of the labor force means that they'll never be lost at all because the Federal Reserve would react by changing interest rates to be lower than what they otherwise would have been.",1,0,1441664098,1444731094
cutt9gj,0,t1_cutsm5t,KaynardMeynes,">No-one in my community benefited from NAFTA. 

Of most free trade agreements, NAFTA appears to have had [one of the smallest impacts generally in either direction](http://delong.typepad.com/pdf/20061223_DeLong_Aftathoughts_on_NAFTA.pdf).  NAFTA definitely produced net gains for Mexican citizens (a modest 15 percent rise in market income, which stinks compared to US growth, but isn't bad overall), but it wasn't really as much as economists thought would happen due to mitigating factors about the Mexican labor force.  Chances are no one in your community was hugely affected by NAFTA, but that you personally weren't affected by it isn't really an argument against it.

Also, the ""parties"" I'm talking about are average citizens of both nations involved.  Free trade in Southeast Asia, for example, has hugely improved the standard of living of the people there and supplied US consumers with cheaper goods.",2,0,1441662849,1444731094
