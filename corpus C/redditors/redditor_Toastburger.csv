cvxbmx4,1,t3_3ohin1,Toastburger,Congratulations Bernie on getting to 1% of Hillary's total endorsements.,1,0,1444681785,1444716334
cvuwt0w,0,t1_cvuwk91,Toastburger,"The NRA is the biggest lobbying group in the country, and it's not because of corporate interests alone. It may seem alien to Reddit, but a *huge* chunk of this country believes that *any* attempt at gun control violates the 2nd amendment. These congressmen aren't ignoring problems, they're doing exactly what their constituents want.",6,0,1444496591,1444716334
cvsdu52,1,t3_3nyk9x,Toastburger,It was always going to be made public before it was voted on. This is not news.,1,0,1444306514,1444716334
cvsd2rt,0,t1_cvs94nl,Toastburger,"The Tea Party has been trying that with the Republicans. Look how far that's gotten them: Despite controlling both chambers under a lame-duck president, they haven't been able to pass anything substantive. ",4,0,1444304220,1444716334
cvs3j3y,0,t1_cvs3734,Toastburger,"Really? Seems to me like Bernie has been struggling for months to get past the low 30% range. 
Edit: Sorry, according to your own link its actually the mid 20% range. ",15,0,1444273431,1444716334
cvs34sy,1,t3_3nx45l,Toastburger,"Bernie's policy proposals are actively anti-free market, and in many cases are very na√Øve in terms of how he could get them implemented as well as in whether they'd even work. 

Look at college costs, for example. I think Hillary's plan for student loans doesn't address the core issue, but it at least has a good chance of being an achievable goal. Sanders free college scheme is, to put it simply, not even remotely possible to get passed today. Beyond that, it has the same problem as Hillary's plan: it doesn't address the core reasons that education is increasing in price, and it adds a sizeable cost to the US budget. 

Hillary isn't my ideal candidate, but she at least has a realistic grasp of what can be accomplished, has the connections and know-how to actually get it done and has the upside of being actually electable. Sanders is a fringe candidate with no mainstream support outside of the leftmost wings of the Democratic party.",47,0,1444272779,1444716334
cvs2fv5,0,t1_cvs2biq,Toastburger,"From elsewhere in the comments, Obama had a total of 48 party endorsements at this point in the election, *plus* the keynote. Stop pretending Sanders is like Obama. He really isn't.",2,0,1444271605,1444716334
cvryctd,0,t1_cvqtfut,Toastburger,And I have no doubt that there would be confrontation aplenty. If the government tried to confiscate guns by force you'd see plenty of people go to arms and probably a few states attempt to secede. ,1,0,1444264882,1444716334
cvrxy8x,0,t1_cvqvx1y,Toastburger,"Putting aside the details that others here have attacked, it has absolutely zero chance of passing through legislature in the US and wouldn't stand up to Supreme Court scrutiny if it did. 

Plus there's all the finicky details about defining your terms. What defines a mental illness, what's a high capacity magazine, etc. Creating a functioning legal definition that isn't easily sidestepped but also isn't overly restrictive has stopped many gun control proposals from being passed or enforced.",1,0,1444264248,1444716334
cvrxc6v,1,t3_3nwp41,Toastburger,"Next to zero, because neither side has incentives to start a direct armed conflict.

For Russia, excluding the use of nuclear arms, they can't compete with the US military. With the use of nuclear arms, both sides lose and neither wins.

For the US, we have nothing to gain from attacking and plenty to lose. 

The current butting of heads between Russia and the US won't stop any time soon, but it will be played out indirectly through conflicts and deals with other nations, because it is in both country's interests to keep it that way.",16,0,1444263262,1444716334
