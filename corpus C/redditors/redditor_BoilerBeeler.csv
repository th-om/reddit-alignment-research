cvnqnvg,0,t1_cvnot31,BoilerBeeler,"I think one of the most important points that people forget is that John Boehner and Obama had made a budget deal in 2010, and had most likely shook hands on it. Then the Senate came out with a deal from the Gang Of Eight and Obama backed out of the deal, because the other deal was better for him politically. He basically screwed Boehner and then set himself up for a do nothing Congress. ",16,0,1443966158,1444719449

Also, the Eurozone has had a large problem with youth unemployment, so you would think it would be that much harder for these immigrants.

cvmesbw,0,t1_cvmemp4,BoilerBeeler,"Yes, the abortions are happening, but the abortion themselves are legal. 

The videos depict two things really. First, that PP handles abortions in a way to keep the organs intact to sell them. You can watch the videos or read some articles if you want some details, I'd rather not discuss the exact procedures. 

Second, that they do indeed sell them to research organizations (not illegal if not for profit). You would think they would have a set price to sell them at cost, but the videos depict the PP reps who seem to be negotiating prices.

So really, get a investigator, check their books, and arrest them or not. Seems like this wouldn't be hard.",11,0,1443840269,1444719449

cvmegsf,1,t3_3na0em,BoilerBeeler,"As far as I know what they were doing was only illegal if they were selling the organs for profit. I have seen no evidence to say they made a profit or that they did not. Its turned into more of a conversation about abortion and women's health funding. 

To me, this seems like this would be an open and closed case if someone would just ask for Planned Parenthood's records. Then if they sold them for profit, throw them in jail, if not we can all move onto the next thing.",10,0,1443839552,1444719449
