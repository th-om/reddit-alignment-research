cvs02nf,0,t1_cvrj80v,laivindil,"If you have a joystick, and one of those controllers they are showing off for Oculus, you could have a clickable cockpit. Just move your hand over the button/switch in the cockpit and click the button on your controller (there could be some sort of indication you are over the button, vibration, its illuminated, etc). The Oculus prototype controller actually monitors your fingers I believe, so you could actually ""flip"" said switches/buttons.",1,0,1444267691,1444722407

Those are the best two in the field IMO.

I've heard good things about the flight model of [Take On Helicopters](http://takeonthegame.com/). And it was patched into Arma 3 for their helicopters. So there's that.",5,0,1444267525,1444722407

cvniwx9,0,t1_cvncydn,laivindil,"""A brief surge"" is as bad a word choice as mine. There were millions of civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan (I think I read recently 3-4 total though how they relate it to the way and so on is always debated). The results of the Arab spring will likely be similar when all is said and done. It would unlikely be brief. And that ""surge"" could easily count in tens of millions.
