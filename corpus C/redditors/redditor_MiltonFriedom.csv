Why do people then have to get married through the goverment? Why do we need contracts saying 'I'm married?' Do people need permission from anyone to marry, gay or straight? I feel like it isn't really the federal government getting involved, more than an option that everyone just takes. People can just 'be married,' right?

Is the only reason the government is 'involved' is to perhaps change taxation methods? I don't like the taxation penalty--I think marriage, if the government is involved, should add tax benefits to be married (which would help with family structure in poorer urban cities, perhaps--I need to research that more).

Anyway, I highly recommend [this article from the Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/11893594/If-the-era-of-democracy-is-over-in-Europe-its-time-for-Britain-to-get-out.html). I always had empathy for the refugees and migrants, but this article made me realize that it's not entirely immoral for countries to not take in refugees. I would like to see it personally, but I will not judge Hungary.

The Hungarian people approve of Victor Orban's policy, as [this article from the Financial Times](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/248dc176-5f8e-11e5-9846-de406ccb37f2.html#axzz3o774ENUB) indicates. If the people of Hungary do not want migrants entering into their country, then it is not right for Hungary to have to take in refugees.

From the first article I linked, ""If democratically mandated national leaders can be condemned for being genuinely in tune with their own electorates,"" then are we supporting democracy or our own morality from countries far off from this refugee crisis.

Hungary can't be blamed for the inconsistent policy of other more significant countries in the EU. Germany unilaterally suspended the normal rules on migrations (then quickly vacillated again). In addition, it was an unelected commission that determined that the EU should accept more refugees.

The most impactful quotation I saw was: 
>Germany, the guilt ridden rehabilitated criminal of the past, wishes to make amends to the world. The former Warsaw Pact countries, having only just discovered the joys of self-determination and democratic accountability, are adamant that they will not be dictated to by another autocratic supranational body that treats them with contempt.

I dislike Victor Orban's policy on principle, but I respect his decision making. And I respect the difficult past Hungary has just emerged from.",6,0,1444431245,1444718498
