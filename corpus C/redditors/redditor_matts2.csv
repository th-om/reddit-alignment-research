So round, 1% are caught. So if you need 2,000 votes you have 20 people caught. We have never had 20 people caught in any one election. And 2,000 votes maybe gets you a win in a small town. 20 people caught tells the authorities that there is an organization behind the fraud. And one of those 20 will turn states' evidence rather than go to jail. So with those figures we know that no one is using fraud to turn an election.

My point is that it is insignificant, not that it is nonexistence.  Now where is the evidence that voter ID fixes things?

>Even in 2000, I didn't support Gore. 

Which is irrelevant to my question. My point was that no one would have thought that 400 fraudulent votes would swing the election.

And we have other evidence that people do get caught. So let us say that 99.9% get away with it. That means that no election has been turned with fraud.

>The 2000 presidential election was decided on less then 400 votes.

After the Republicans engaged in vote suppression by removing 10s of thousands of actually valid registrations. And that is really a deceptive figure anyway. Suppose it was Oct 2000. Would you have said ""all I need is 401 votes in FL and Gore wins""?
