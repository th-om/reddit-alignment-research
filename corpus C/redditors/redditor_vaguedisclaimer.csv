We will never forego our hate,

Hate by water and hate by land,

Hate of the SJW and hate of the ""other"",

Hate of the Fatty and hate of the Pao,

Hate of seventy millions choking down.

We love as one, we hate as one,

We have one foe and one alone--

We went from DDS clawing back our respite money to a state that has given us in-home BCBA services and a generous respite allowance, and it is indeed a conservative southern state. Not that I'm in love with the government here, the corruption makes CT look like small potatoes, but I have no idea where all the money I paid in taxes went in CT, as we sure didn't see any of it back.",2,0,1442680857,1444727501
