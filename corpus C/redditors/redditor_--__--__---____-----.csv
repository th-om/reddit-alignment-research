This strategy works better if you learn to stop caring what she thinks or says. Don't be deliberately mean, but don't go to any lengths to apologize if she's mad at you.",3,0,1442942308,1444725297
cvadbtz,1,t3_3lyhmf,--__--__---____-----,"Your wife doesn't come across very well here. If she's so worried about your parents spending money on your sister--which is frankly none of her business--I can only conclude that she's earmarked your parents' money for herself already. A healthy reaction would have been to be proud that you and her don't need help from your parents to make ends meet.

Is marriage counselling an option? Maybe an unbiased third party will help your wife come to her senses.",6,0,1442942107,1444725297
cvactsm,1,t3_3lyeju,--__--__---____-----,"Disclaimer: I have no expertise or direct knowledge of child psychology. I'm just telling you how I would handle this in your shoes.

Sit down with the three of you and tell your niece very clearly that you're not her father, and she shouldn't call you dad, but that you love her like a daughter, you'll always be there for her, and are happy/proud to be a father figure to her.

I suspect part of this is a reaction to seeing her mom get hit on. She's 11, she understands what was happening there (maybe not perfectly, but she gets the basic idea) and this is inevitably confusing for her. It's up to your sister whether and how to address to her daughter the subject of her dating life, but that's kind of a separate issue from the ""who's my daddy"" one.",27,0,1442941369,1444725297
