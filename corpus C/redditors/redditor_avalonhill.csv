I know some people are really, really passionate about bike commuting.  I have found that not many can see the issue more broadly.  I am glad that you enjoy biking in Chicago.  You think the cost is low.  Ok, maybe you know how much it costs to have city Streets and San crews go out and set these up.  I am sure then you also know how dire the city budget it.  But hey, priorities, put in bike lanes.  As far as the impact on commuting into the city.  If you are truly passionate about biking in Chicago, and that is the reason why you came to Chicago, then there is absolutely nothing that will even remotely help you understand the negative impact of the lanes.  So there is no point to try.  

As far as safety, the number of fatalities and deaths of cyclists has always been low.  2014 was somewhat of a bad year with 6 fatalities, bike lanes and all.  About 3-5 deaths and a dozen or so car vs cyclists happen every year in Chicago.  So all that money that could have gone somewhere else, like pothole filling, went to benefit people downtown and on the northside.  

Edit: city population has been dropping, so a lot of good the bike lanes have done.",-3,0,1444693387,1444716664
cvxhsmj,0,t1_cvxfly0,avalonhill,"Wow, I made it through your rant.  First, I didn't say anything about expense, bike vs. car, so maybe you meant that for someone else.  If minorities can make it to work on bikes without bike lanes, I am sure young, white, middle class people in one of the most segregated cities in the US can as well http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/05/04/chicago-is-the-most-segregated-city-in-america-analysis/

If you know anything about Chicago, it is also one of the most racist.  I find it amusing you equate Humboldt Park area as a ""minority"" area.  You are obviously aware of the third world type neighborhoods of Chicago.  That said, I think helping improve conditions for the abject poor in the city by spending money on mental health, paying pensions, etc. would be money better spent.

Enjoy your bike lanes paid for by the tears of the young, poor, and minority.",-7,0,1444691146,1444716664
cvxbvds,0,t1_cvxb449,avalonhill,"Well designed infrastructure is designed to economically benefit an area.  In the suburban areas of Chicago, biking is very easy to do.  In Illinois there are laws and rules that govern sharing of the roads between bikes and cars.  People can't follow the rules so we needed to protect a small minority of people.  Minorities in the city seem to get along well without bike lanes, but the wealthier residents seem to need the lanes.


From Grid Chicago:

When the mayor took the mic he touted the economic benefits of protected bike lanes, which he argues will attract technology companies to the city. 

Chicago POLS need to constant attract people from other states to move to Chicago. Because people do, and when they do, they see how wonderful the suburbs are and how much less expensive it is and move away.  They tolerate the commutes only when they have to.  Their money stays away from the city.",-10,0,1444682115,1444716664
cvxag9c,1,t3_3og8zj,avalonhill,"I am curious about the investment vs. the return.  How many people benefit from the cost.  I know many many people who will not go into Chicago because it is too difficult to get around some areas with one complaint being bike lanes.  The city is broke, yet they feel the need to accommodate a very, very small minority of people who are likely primarily white, upper middle class.  I am in and out of the City quite often and the non-white people I see ""commute"" to work don't have any access to a bike lane that leads them to where they need to go.  Also, putting a stripe where cars used to park and calling it a bike lane is doesn't bring the prosperity people of Chicago need.

Local institutions are charities and other groups like the rotary club, veterans charities, local businesses that contribute to the welfare of a community.  When I talk to people about local institutions their heads explode because they start to think everything will be controlled by religion.  NO, there are many great non religion based institutions.  

Moreover, as a psychotherapist in private practice i give away more free counseling hours, i.e. it costs me money to see people due to rent and other costs, than my local government funded ""free"" counseling clinic that always has a waiting list.  ",1,0,1444670448,1444716664
cvx395p,1,t3_3og1ue,avalonhill,"Bernie Sanders is not peddling reality. He peddles feel good free stuff.  I was really excited about him at first, but then as I heard more and more, he just promises a lot and gives off a good hippie, ""white people and religion are responsible for all of life's problems"" B.S. that young college educated people like to hear.  

For what it is worth, John Boehner made the point last week, that there are things that can get done in government then there is idealism.  Obama, Sanders, Warren - all unabashed idealists, just like the Tea Party nuts.

But before you get all agitated because I criticized the beloved ones, life isn't an egalitarian kindergarten.  You will never get everyone to play nice.  Moreover, you all get sidetracked by talks about sticking it to the wealthy and being nice and safe while your liberties are stolen from you.  the interaction between citizen and government should be one where the effort is to limit government and get local institutions to provide.  Nothing good comes from broad controlling bloated government.  

I love how the Pope's humanitarian message to the US government was twisted from a lecture to them about how government is a body made up of corrupt people to we need more government.    ",6,0,1444669729,1444716664

I did read that, and also the part where ~~Government money~~, ~~taxes~~, money collected from working people would fund these universal (I would bet government approved) textbooks.  Or as someone else suggested to me, we can all just use wikipedia, because we all know how accurate that is.
