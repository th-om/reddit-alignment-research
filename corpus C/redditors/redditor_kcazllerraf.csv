cvsjc5s,1,t3_3ny1an,kcazllerraf,"You can see most of the deaths caused by skywalker as either combat or self defense (the two seem to blend together). The deathstar was about to destroy an occupied moon when luke blew it up, the stormtroopers were all actively trying to kill him, and jabba had taken his friend as a wall decoration. 

In every case, his goal was to save himself or his friends. He found setting his goal to be killing someone morally rehensible, but if he had a noble goal and those attempting to prevent him were trying to kill him, he did not restrict himself from returning in kind.",2,0,1444316946,1444716614
cvs9mbt,0,t1_cvs8lsw,kcazllerraf,"You're forgetting that you probably already have the initial velocity of falling all the way from the surface. Which would give you just enough of a boost to make it all the way back up to the surface on the other side; neglecting air resistance and assuming both ends of the tunnel are equidistant from the center.

But yes, unless you were in a really tough tube, you would be dead from the tube collapsing due to the immense heat and pressure. but then you aren't really in a tube.",3,0,1444289765,1444716614
cvs9jq5,1,t3_3nxw04,kcazllerraf,"Sort of... The problem isn't so much that it's just a long way down, It's also very hot. Like incredibly hot. The temperature at the center of the earth is around 5400 degrees Celsius. In perspective, the melting point of tungsten, the metal with the high melting point, is 3400 degrees Celsius. Note that those temperatures are only applicable at normal pressures, in the center of the earth the pressure is 3.5 Million times the pressure at the surface. 

So in order to make a tube going through the center of the earth, it would have to be 
1. strong enough to support a pressure difference of 3.5 million atmospheres, in order to keep the interior non-deadly.
2. Insulative enough to keep the interior 5000 degrees cooler.
3. 13,000 km across, larger than any man-made structure.

Making a structure that can do all of those things is just beyond our current understanding of materials. 

Anyways, assume we make the tunnel. It'd have to be more complicated than just jumping in and falling all the way through, due to angular momentum. since the earth is spinning, you're actually moving east really fast all the time. As you get closer to the center, that part of the earth doesn't have to move as far to spin the same amount, so it has less eastward velocity. [here's a picture demonstrating the idea, the arrows are the velocity of rocks at a given distance from the core](http://i.imgur.com/9EqtFdb.png). Now imagine taking a rock from the surface and moving it towards the center. Suddenly the rock is moving way faster than the rocks around it and it crashes into the side of the hole. The rock is you, if you tried to jump into the hole. And this actually doesn't take very long to come into effect; bowling balls dropped down mine shafts never hit the bottom because they hit the side first.

So all in all, you've got a lot of problems, but I guess theoretically you could make the whole thing out of layers of graphene (which conduct heat terrifically along the mesh, but terribly between layers of mesh) and maybe it'd work. If you made it go from the North pole to the South pole, the rotation issue wouldn't be a problem, and you could free-fall all the way through the earth in 42 minutes, though if you made a straight tunnel through the earth between any two points and free-fell through it, it'd still take 42 minutes, no matter how far.",1,0,1444289478,1444716614

cvrekfa,0,t1_cvrdcdb,kcazllerraf,"Thats true. Dating, in a relationship, and in a serious relationship sort of all meant the same thing in highschool,  which really threw my mom off when she'd try to grill me on what was going on in my life, but going on dates without being in a relationship is much more of a thing in college. I think a large part of the divide is where the knowledge about relationships comes from, when you're young it mostly comes from TV and all the terms see to blend together, but once you start to get experience you can see the difference",2,0,1444234749,1444716614
