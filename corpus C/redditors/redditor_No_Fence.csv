cvx5o67,0,t1_cvx4mh2,No_Fence,Please. Irresponsible borrowing will *always* happen if lenders allow it. There isn't a single society that wouldn't overestimate their own ability to pay back loans. That's literally why we have professionals deciding these things - and those professionals failed miserably at their jobs.,5,0,1444673242,1444723197

cvx1y9g,0,t1_cvwz0n1,No_Fence,"Europe has so, so much hate for immigrants. There's at least one party in every country that spews some serious anti-immigrant rhetoric to, you guessed it, get votes.

I don't think it's accurate to put upwards and downwards hate equal to each other. There is some upwards hate, yes, but it's much more justified than the downwards hate. Take the 2008 crash; five million people lost their homes, three million people lost their jobs, and about ~5000 committed suicide. Almost all of the people affected were poor. Yet, who caused it? Investors, bankers, and rampant greed. Barely any punishment was doled out, and the same CEOs still rule Wall Street.

The higher up the economic ladder you get the less accountability there is, and the poor notice it. The rich also enjoy lives of excess, but rarely fight for more equality, instead preferring to fight any tax hike with massive lobbying power and influence. They use dividing issues like abortion and racism to turn poor people on each other. They have control of the governing system - most Senators are millionaires. They have huge wealth at the cost of others; income inequality is worse in the US than it has been since right before the Great Depression. 

The difference between hating the rich and the poor is that the poor are continually oppressed, while the rich have the power to change things but choose not to. If a slave hates his master and the master hates his slave, are they equally important hatreds?",14,0,1444667733,1444723197

It depresses me that there is no ethical code in business.",2,0,1444666838,1444723197

cvx109w,0,t1_cvwzdmq,No_Fence,"A $15 min wage has been promoted by a lot of serious economists. Not like there's a consensus or anything, but it's not obvious what the economically best course of action is. I also don't think ethical considerations are tangential. 

The people that think it's clearly bad economic policy usually know very little about actual economic policy, and very much about hating downwards.",-1,0,1444666255,1444723197
cvwos3o,1,t3_3of1f2,No_Fence,"It's funny, I completely agreed with his assessment of the situation, and then he proposes that the GOP should have the power to strongarm candidates into line by withholding funding.

Wouldn't it be better if we had a system where each candidate is allowed to speak their mind and money isn't around?",1,0,1444631185,1444723197

History usually shows that extremes aren't the best idea -- the rush to get to 100% free trade right now seems pushed by corporations that have everything to gain from it.",0,0,1444621896,1444723197
