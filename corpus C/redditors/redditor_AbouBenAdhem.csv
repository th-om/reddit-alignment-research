cvrw332,1,t3_3nw5s9,AbouBenAdhem,"There are two orbital characteristics that would affect the seasons on an annual basis: axial tilt and eccentricity. Axial tilt is the main thing that drives seasons on Earth; and it will always generate earthlike seasons with winter and summer alternating in opposite hemispheres.

Eccentricity refers to how elliptical an orbit is—Earth’s is nearly circular, so it has little effect; but a planet with a highly elliptical orbit will have a short, very hot period once a year when the planet swings past the sun. This will affect the whole planet simultaneously, so one hemisphere might experience it in the middle of its axial summer while the other experiences it in the middle of winter.

The axis of rotation can also precess over time—on Earth this takes thousands of years, but for other planets it might be more rapid. If a planet has an eccentric orbit, precession will cause the axial seasons to move relative to the hot spell when the planet swings past the sun.",1,0,1444261151,1444726672
