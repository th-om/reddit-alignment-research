cv5u89t,1,t3_3lf52g,aspres21,"Honestly, just pace yourself.  Keep yourself hydrated obviously too and have a few redbulls through the night.  People go all-out so early it seems like and then are dead after 4 or so hours.  Just keep the raging at a chill level in the beginning, slowly work up to a good level, then ease back down towards the end of the night.",3,0,1442584503,1444724009

cs6ujmz,1,t3_396ye5,aspres21,"Take a look at the Lake Express ferry from Milwaukee to Muskegon. It's better priced IMO (for the hassle of it all), much faster, and will put you fairly close to Rothbury similar to Ludington (except south). 

Works out to about $459 RT for a car and 2 pax, so higher priced but a way smoother experience and sooooooo much faster and less hassle.
