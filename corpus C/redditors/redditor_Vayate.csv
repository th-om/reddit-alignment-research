In Bernie's case, he just has to say that he wants to tax people who don't make up the majority of his voter base, and use those taxes to give his voters free stuff. A little disregard for what's realistic goes a long way toward getting people to the polls. That's how the PRI has stayed in power in Mexico for a such a long time.",1,0,1444695620,1444717376

cvwud1s,0,t1_cvwooum,Vayate,"It's certainly fair to compare them. The Second Amendment is ordinary constitutional law and no different from the First or the Fourth. Like the other Amendments, government must prove that it has a compelling interest in restricting the right it protects, and the restrictions must be related to that compelling interest. That's where a lot of gun control falls apart. No one disputes that government has an interest in reducing violence, but the restrictions are usually not related to that interest, either because they're arbitrary or ineffective.",8,0,1444653104,1444717376

cvwu86q,0,t1_cvwo11k,Vayate,"Most objections aren't over the principle of background checks, but over the implementation. The proposals Democrats have submitted have been de facto bans on private sales. They would eliminate gun shows and the secondary market by forcing all sales to go through an FFL. This is a bit like banning everyone but dealerships from selling cars. The Coburn Amendment is a Republican compromise proposal that doesn't have those side effects, but it was rejected by Democrats during the last gun control push. Frankly I suspect that those ""side effects"" are actually the main intended effect of the background check legislation.

There's also the fact that buying through an FFL means recording your name, address, and your gun's make, model and serial number. There's a lot of opposition to that because it can be used to enforce more onerous restrictions later. This has been the case any time a registry has been established. For example, let's say the government bans AR-15s. It can't confiscate those guns to enforce the ban without a registry. I'm not talking about door to door confiscation, since no one does that in practice, but the government can and will send letters informing owners to come to the police station and turn in their guns, and they can and will take action again people who don't comply. When Obama talks about implementing the Australian model, that's what he's referring to.",11,0,1444652714,1444717376
