Say you took a risk and removed an annoying pillar that was in the living area of your condo. You were 99% certain that the pillar was decorative and not load bearing. The ceiling collapsed and your upstairs neighbor fell into your condo. They fractured their neck in such a way that they literally could not be moved without injuring their spine and dying. It will take them roughly 9 months to heal to a point where they can be removed from your condo. Since it was your risk of removing the pillar that caused the situation you are legally required to accommodate and care for the dependent party in your condo. Your property rights are trumped by the injured man's right to life. Had the upstairs neighbor or a third party caused the collapse your liability would be different.

For a libertarian to keep the abortion laws like they are we have to answer the question, ""Do we want to grant government the power to grant exceptions to equal treatment under the law?""",-1,0,1444675516,1444718052

A country that has the means to stop the terrorism and does not will not be allowed to prosper in the world. The people will not be allowed to travel to the US. The airlines that serve those people will not be allowed to travel to the US. Financial assets will be seized and infrastructure will be destroyed. Leaders will be killed. Change will happen or the ground will be razed in a way that no life will exist in that place for hundreds of thousands of years.

cvx6j9l,0,t1_cvwpwfg,mrhymer,">In general the charts that compare CPI with wages show that wages have largely kept up.

Except for the fact we keep changing the CPI measure so that it reflects the 1-2% goal. It's also why money and monetary policy is not taught at all in K-12 and that college is only an indoctrination into the Feds evolution Keynesian ideas.

If you measure inflation by the pre-1980 measure there is no possible chance that wage could keep up with inflation.

>I think we should adopt a monetary system based on Gesell's Freiwirtschaft and we should accompany that monetary system with a tiny land value tax and a Financial Transaction Tax. Furthermore, we should re-instate and modernize Glass-Steagal.

I think we should adopt the pre-1913 model of no central bank, market interest rates, and gold backed money. (Bracing for the wailing and gnashing of teeth.)",1,0,1444674482,1444718052
cvx6821,0,t1_cvwoby1,mrhymer,">The only tactic that unions have is to damage the profit engine of the company that pays their wages. It is a tactic that creates a hostile relationship between owner and worker. That tactic worked well when companies and commerce were all local and exporting and importing was expensive and rare.  Unions have not changed their tactics for more than a hundred years. Strikes do not work in an age of global trade and cheap international shipping. We have seen entire industries leave the US in the last 40 years.

Unions need to make changes to become relevant in the information age.

The first step is for unions to secure the right to report information to the public about the jobs their workers are doing. The number of units that are made, the number shipped, the raw parts that are used, the state of the equipment, worker morale, injuries and safety conditions, etc. Unions should hire an impartial third party non-profit organization to gather data from it's members and publish a quarterly report to sell to investors. Investors rut like dogs around a bitch in heat for inside information about the corporations they invest in. If unions and their workers could provide valuable independent investor information as a check and balance on the CEO and CFO's quarterly report then investors would gravitate to businesses with unions. Unions would be a value add to investors instead of a hindrance.
If unions and management reach an impasse the unions simply stop reporting. Investment in the company would slow down or stop because of labor problems but the business that pays the employees salaries would not shut down. Management would cut off their right nut to prevent their stocks from going down. Management and labor would become a symbiotic relationship instead of an adversarial one.",1,0,1444674036,1444718052
