Not really, if you know what you're talking about. The Southern Strategy largely re-aligned white Southerners, who flocked to the Republican party. Minorities, in turn, became solid Democratic voters. 

> No, you don't.

[Yes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1964) [we.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1968) [do.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1972) We also have [empirical academic](http://www.amazon.com/Issue-Evolution-Transformation-American-Politics/dp/069102331X) evidence that it happened. This is so thoroughly documented I don't know how any semi-intelligent human can deny it. You can't simply cite one House election as proof positive that the southern strategy is a myth. Especially since we have [historical evidence](http://thenewyorker.typepad.com/online__georgepacker/files/dividing_the_democrats1.pdf) saying such.

> flatly untrue.

Neverland is real.

No? Darn, I guess we can't just say things and make them so. You've been provided abundant historical and empirical evidence demonstrating that the Southern Strategy was a thing and that realignment actually happened. Keep your head in the sand all you want, that doesn't change history. 

> stop peddling lies.

This is why I have you tagged as ""willfully ignorant uneducated nutbag."" You're one of like three people I've ever seen in this subreddit willfully and openly disagree with history and outright reject academic evidence simply because they don't conform to your preconceived notions. 

I don't have time for more of your uneducated nonsense. I suggest you [read a book](http://www.amazon.com/Issue-Evolution-Transformation-American-Politics/dp/069102331X) and come back when you have the slightest clue what you're talking about. ",1,0,1444694837,1444729605

You went and purchased the book I cited and read it *that* quickly? That's impressive.

Seriously though, we have empirical evidence that it happened. If you aren't convinced by hard data, no amount of discussion will help. 

> You posit the theory that this is because Republicans successfully appealed to segregationists and so segregationists started voting for them.

Stop acting like this is a novel idea I've invented in this thread. We've had empirical evidence that this happened since 1989. 

> You said Republicans were the party in favor of racial segregation. If that's not calling Republicans racist I'm unsure what is.

""Republicans were racist"" is calling them racist. ""Republicans appealed to anti-civil rights sentiment to win elections"" is simply making an observation based on empirical and historical fact.
