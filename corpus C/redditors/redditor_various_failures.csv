I would hope to not be judged by employers, but that is our of our control. Just got to give them every reason to hire us.",3,0,1444691921,1444720289

cvxi62u,1,t3_3oi7vf,various_failures,"So a guy I know that works admissions says it is a revenue thing, the school he works at looked into having a ChemE program, but it just didn't work numbers wise. 

I wouldn't say it is the hardest or most competitive. This stuff varies with interest... 

What is it with people trying to figure which major is the hardest?",1,0,1444691759,1444720289

However, I am not sure how that shows practicality over theoretical education? Sounds like some people didn't pay attention in their materials class, and you sound pretty sharp.  ",1,0,1444684409,1444720289

cvxcnjy,0,t1_cvxam9h,various_failures,"I guess.... a majority of engineering is modeling because building an experimental setup is pretty expensive until you have the scope nailed down. Can you give an example of the how and when your practical ability outshone the theoretical side since both were taught at your school? I am not talking about cutting radius on a lathe... 

What is that most big companies need from an engineer? Show up on time, try not to be a shitbag, and have a nice attitude. ",1,0,1444683215,1444720289

cvxaj38,1,t3_3oems7,various_failures,"Why? It is the arbitrary cutoff NASA selected. It's sorta like GPA. NCEES has a description of the roles the degrees factor in for jobs. Simply put ET doesn't set you up to do R&D which is what those people at NASA are doing. Everything else you are probably fine for: project management, test and evaluation etc. 

Fair warning it is the arbitrary cut off for A LOT of engineering jobs. Granted, if you have something that makes your resume stand out all bets are off. It is easy for HR to decide for a stack of resumes EE>ET. ",1,0,1444680227,1444720289
