They were talking about police shootings, then they kind of just played Bernie's clip and now they moved on to talking about religion in politics.  As a Bernie supporter I'm glad he got some airtime but it felt very out of place.",1,0,1444704702,1444728198
cvpbhxi,1,t3_3nmats,Concordiaa,"Doesn't answer all your questions but from Sanders' offices' summary of the ""College For All"" Act he introduced in the Senate ( http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/collegeforallsummary/?inline=file ):

"". . . To qualify for federal funding, states must meet a number of requirements designed to protect students, ensure quality, and reduce ballooning costs. States will need to maintain spending on their 
higher education systems, on academic instruction, and on need-based financial aid. In addition, colleges and universities must reduce their reliance on low-paid adjunct faculty. 

States would be able to use funding to increase academic opportunities for students, hire new faculty, and provide professional development opportunities for professors. 

No funding under this program may be used to fund administrator salaries, merit-based financial aid, or the construction of non-academic buildings like stadiums and student centers.""",4,0,1444077612,1444728198

cvlnq3p,1,t3_3n81j7,Concordiaa,"Just my two cents: I wouldn't want to go to a debate watching party where everyone was drinking.  Not because I don't drink, I do, but I would be afraid of people getting obnoxious and making noises/comments over the other candidates.  I know not many people like Hillary but I wouldn't want people talking over her when she's speaking.

I save it for the Republicans because you pretty much **need** to have a drink when you watch that group.",4,0,1443794566,1444728198

cvfwpbs,1,t3_3mlcxb,Concordiaa,I don't think we should significantly change our strategy either way.  It is still very early in the race and Bernie is doing great in polls and in contributions.  Regardless of who is in the race we need to continue to make sure that people become familiar with who Bernie is and get them registered to vote in primaries.,1,0,1443372864,1444728198

cvamfrj,1,t3_3lzeb3,Concordiaa,"I'm mostly worried that they will attempt to limit the time he talks either by focusing on Hillary a lot or causing the other candidates to bicker about trivial issues (like the Republicans).  The thing is I think a lot of the other candidates may feel the system is rigged for Hillary and spend time addressing that, which may in the end help Bernie.",4,0,1442955403,1444728198
