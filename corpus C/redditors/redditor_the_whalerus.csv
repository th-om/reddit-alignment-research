cvnxgg0,1,t3_3nfqgd,the_whalerus,"This isn't actually true.  

There was a Hacker News post a while back when Netflix actually implemented this policy, and it had the same tone: people screaming that this was the end of vacation time without actually investigating. 

Then a guy who actually worked at Netflix showed up.  He said that the bosses around there were actually concerned with the welfare of their employees and insisted that they take some vacation.  He said he takes more vacation time now that they have unlimited vacation time. ",5,0,1443978499,1444725183
cviywjg,1,t3_3mwve0,the_whalerus,"Freedom of speech is so important because speech informs how you think. I think that's one of the points made by Orwell in 1984 that people don't talk about.  The reason so many of the characters were involved in creating Newspeak was so that they could more easily suppress ideas they didn't like. 

We learned the same thing in a linguistics class I took back in the day. The way you talk affects the way you think.  If you can't say something, you'll have a harder time thinking it. 

EDIT: I found somebody else on Reddit saying [the same thing as me](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/3mw06k/thoughts_on_orwells_1984_the_language_of_dystopia/)!  How exciting. ",1,0,1443587820,1444725183
cvfwis8,1,t3_3ml2cu,the_whalerus,"How exactly does one look a graph showing that the vast majority of the planet is warmer than average (much of that being much warmer than average) and conclude from the single spot that is colder that we aren't warming the planet? Actually, not even that, they claim that the planet isn't warming at all. 

This is desperate. ",1,0,1443372538,1444725183
cvfwacj,1,t3_3mkzpm,the_whalerus,"I'm American, but I did 23andMe and learned that my ancestry is primarily British and French.  My existence is just as dependent on those cultures.  There was some German in there too.  

Your existence is affected by the entire world and the entire history of the world.  To say that one culture is ""directory responsible for all that surrounds"" you is ignorant and short sighted. 

There's a difference, I think, between saying something like ""I like the culture I'm in and I want my team to do better"" vs ""My team is superior to other teams.""  I see nothing wrong with the former, and maybe I wrongly associate nationalism with the latter, but that's generally what I, in the States, see. ",2,0,1443372116,1444725183

cvbeaxp,1,t3_3m0yez,the_whalerus,"I like Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul.  I think the others have their moments where they seem potentially viable, but they're either ~~Trump~~ ridiculous or run of the mill politicians saying absolutely anything to get elected.  

I agree more with Bernie Sanders economically, but the biggest victory for either Sanders or Paul is that, in my amateur opinion, they have the respect for the system of government and they respect for the office of the president enough that they won't circumvent the procedures to do what they want.  

I think they're the only genuine candidates running, and either one of them would set a tone for while they're in office that would help the government run more smoothly.  ",2,0,1443020686,1444725183
