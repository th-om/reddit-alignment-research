I'm not sure what this means. It still sounds like you're saying that morality is democratic. 

>They're not arbiters of law.
A different way of saying what I meant by this remark is that the State is an entity that serves as the ""source"" of law within a region, that is, the State is what people listen to when trying to determine what the law is.

That's still a pretty bad definition of the state though. It's defining characteristics is political authority, and a geographical monopoly. An entity without that is not a state, even if that entity is a source of law.

>Then why did you say ""Your reason for why the state is different is terrible""? You weren't implying that the State isn't different?

The fact that people react differently to something does not mean that it is different in a philosophical sense. It sounds like you're basing your philosophy on how people react and think about things. Why is that? If I put on a bear costume and people reacted to it as if they'd seen a bear, could I then be considered to actually be a bear? 

>Which assumes political authority requires arguments. Which is an obscure moral view.
The State has authority. Why does it have authority? Because we think it does. There's nothing invalid about that answer. It doesn't fail to satisfy a significant portion of the population. We understand that power is socially constructed.

That answer doesn't justify anything though. Also, assuming that political authority requires arguments is a pretty standard view within philosophy. Why you think that's obscure I have no idea. Or is this just an artifact of you developing your philosophy from what you imagine the man on the street thinks about things? 

Your answer here is a cop out. It's like saying that ""Things happen for a reason"" is a perfectly legitimate explanation for why something happens, or that ""That's just the way it is"" is a perfectly reasonable way to answer criticism about the status-quo. 

 >Which means he's conflating two things that almost nobody else would ever conflate. An obscure moral view. 

He doesn't conflate. He follows the logic. He has an entire book where he lays this out in a very common sense fashion. I'm not sure why you keep repeating the word obscure. Why not throw in some ""radicals"" in there too? Again, morality isn't a popularity contest. ",1,0,1444643072,1444717910

cvwqu3k,0,t1_cvwqfdj,I_am_Norwegian,"> That people react to the State differently from how they react to private actors is only an observation of fact, not an argument in its own right. But what many anarcho-capitalists try and do is say that because they can't locate the ""source"" of that authority, it must not actually have any authority at all, or that the onus is on the State to ""prove"" that it has the authority it has. This is far from being something most people naturally intuit; it stems from Huemer's idiosyncratic philosophy (though he tries to sell it as a natural extension of what people already believe).

That's not a secret though. We all know that people react differently to the state. That's sort of what we mean when we talk about assumed legitimacy and political authority. That alone doesn't justify it. People react differently when I ask them for money to keep their place safe, and when the mob does. So what? 

We don't say that we can't find the source of authority. We look at the arguments for political authority, and then we refute them. Well, that's what the Huemerian AnCaps do anyways. I wouldn't say Ethical Intuisionism is idiosyncratic either. His book on ethical intuitionism is fairly popular in the academic philosophy crowd. I remember one philosopher said that he ""solved epistemology"" which is pretty high praise. 

Also, when Huemer argues his points, he doesn't use what people believe about the state, but what people believe about more basic morality. He also doesn't believe that the conclusion of someones intuition is necessarily correct. It's possible to have some pieces of information, and to then draw the wrong conclusion.

>My argument for the State defined as any sort of arbiter of law within a region is that it's unavoidable; no anarchist sect has presented a coherent theory for how to get around its necessity (and I say this after having spent a long time searching for one). What such theories always boil down to is proposing that society build newer, smaller States to replace the ones it has now.
For the State defined as a legal agency that has the power to confiscate and imprison, as I have previously reasoned is the way anarcho-capitalists must understand it (see here), I would argue simply that such powers seem very practical for enforcers, and so I doubt any society won't have agencies that claim those rights for themselves (though they may have to be renamed ""rights enforcement agencies"" or something similar).

It's weird that you define the state as ""any sort of arbiter of law within a region"". We have actual arbiters today. Are these people states? Are the firms they work for states? A state is a regional monopoly on violence. It's an entity of political authority. With that definition, you avoid drawing in non-state entities into your definition of what a state is. Every structure with flour in it isn't a bakery. 

I don't want to turn this into a debate of whether anarchic polycentric law is possible or not. I'm sure you've heard of Iceland's history with it, and I'm sure you've had tons of less than fruitful discussions about anarchic law here. 

>I read the bits and pieces of him that people throw at me. Considering seeing the chains I commented on in this thread if that interests you.

Read the book. Even if you end up disagreeing, it's a great book. The writing style is refreshing, and Huemer is extremely thorough. Reading your comment in that thread makes it seem like there's some sort of disconnect that makes it hard to respond to you, which also wouldn't happen if you read the book. Your arguments in that thread seem to assume that the government legitimately owns all of the land within some lines on a map. If that was true, then you'd be somewhat correct in saying that the power is symmetric, though I'm not sure why the symmetry of authority is important. ",1,0,1444638848,1444717910

Also, it's not that we don't understand it. Just about every libertarian has a pretty good understanding of just about every common argument for the state. It's that we are against it, that we think it's ridiculous.

The notion that all moral actors are subject to the same ethical rules is not exactly obscure. There is something wrong about saying ""X is bad when Y does it but not when Z does it."" without providing further explanation. It's not inherently wrong, sure, but a statement like that does beg for actual argumentation. I'm not sure why you're so keen on appealing to society. I suspect the average person doesn't exactly align with your political views, right?

cvweju1,0,t1_cvwdazh,I_am_Norwegian,"> I'm referring to the libertarians that propose the State to be ""unjustified"" in some way, as though they require explicit philosophical justification to begin with, despite the fact that nearly all people disagree, by pretending that the whole population should bend to their idea of ""consistency (i.e., they have to be absolutists that equate the particular things that libertarians want them to).

Philosophy is not a popularity contest. Morality isn't democratic. It's also bizarre to think that the state does not require philosophical justification, when someone that's not the state acting exactly like the state is so plainly acting immorally. 

Also, you don't have to be absolutist to be an AnCap. I still don't see how AnCaps are forcing their views onto anyone. 

>Social commons not conveyed by market prices. This could refer to repressive ideas about gender. It could also refer to the culturally destructive effects of an unregulated advertisements market. Libertarians tend to view the world through the lens that is a hypothetical about two people stranded on an island together, which makes it difficult for them to understand, much less critique, social relations not in the form of direct physical violence (hence what may as well be the official libertarian catch phrase, ""so long as it's voluntary"").

Not being offended by advertisements is hardly something specific to libertarians. I also think you're confusing economics with philosophy here. There's tons libertarians have to say about things that are not conveyed by market prices. It's just that we're not very keen on regulating culture, or gender. Just because we don't share your views about social relations does not mean that we do not understand them. It's just that it's not relevant. It's not important. It falls outside of our political philosophy. We don't tend to discuss ethnocentrism either.
