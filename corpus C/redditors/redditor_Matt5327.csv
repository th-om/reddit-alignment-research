cvw6mmz,0,t1_cvw2k0h,Matt5327,"I was merely answering your question about why ""that which pertains to a human being"" was different than personhood. Personhood merely refers to ""that which is sufficiently like myself to deserve treatment equal to that which I deserve"" To some, that may mean possessing sapience. To others, being of the same race. Neither are inherently more or less correct definitions of a person, because personhood it such an inherently nebulous term.

""Human,"" however, it not nearly so nebulous. Though not always precise, it will never refer to aliens/AI and will always be inclusive of race, sex, and other factors of variation. 

>I'm not sure why that's so bad anyway.

It's neither inherently good nor bad. I merely intend to point out that it permits us to expand or retract rights as we please, and on a whim were it not for the rather slow nature of our legal system. Some might not take issue with that. Some, such as myself, do.",1,0,1444596292,1444718558

I was definitely surprised by 'Victory' as the word of choice, at first. But for me, the words that followed gave me chills. He is saying that if we do not fight, we will die. And if we fail to win, completely and totally, we will die. That the Vandul are monsters, that everything they are is our destruction, though that their destruction would be our deliverance. 

In so many ways, it was everything that we regret about ourselves today. It was such a human speech. I loved it.",11,0,1444537507,1444718558

cvv9ay8,0,t1_cvv7dqf,Matt5327,"I'd contend that it's extremely unlikely, but I wouldn't dismiss it as impossible; though true assuming a sufficiently high number of strategic voters, I would contend that past elections with fair third party support demonstrate otherwise. As the most extreme example, Teddy Roosevelt finished 2nd in a race involving a strong democrat and Republican who really could be described as neither strong nor week. Teddy, was, of course, also well-known, well-liked and an incredibly strong candidate. 

Had Taft been a weaker candidate and Wilson less appealing to the southern bloc, it is entirely conceivable that Roosevelt would have won. It would have been a fluke, sure, but sufficient I think to consider the existent possibility of such an election in the future.",2,0,1444519622,1444718558
