cvwgnqd,0,t1_cvwdun4,AnchorDTOM,"Fair point, and I do think that lessig should be in the debates because he qualifies. However, he should not be in place of the politicians that were mentioned because he has raised more money..

cvvp3on,1,t3_3o7kzt,AnchorDTOM,Only thing is: Chafee has served in public office for 30 years. Lessig has never been elected to any office. He has no experience. Not fair to compare him to Chafee. ,1,0,1444560051,1444725378

cvr6qod,0,t1_cvqwnxe,AnchorDTOM,"I would rather pick from 2 people who have actually held political office, and both Chafee and Webb met the requirement of at least 1% in 3 national polls in the 6 weeks leading up to the debate. I see that you want Lessig to be in the debate, and if he met those requirements he deserves a spot at the podium, but not over 2 men who have actually held political office. And for the record, a candidate is not required to raise money to be credible, nor does having raised money make a candidate credible. ",0,0,1444220966,1444725378
cvqn24e,1,t3_3nmksw,AnchorDTOM,"Explain this logic: Lessig has 0 years of public service, has never held an elected office, his only qualification is that he is a Ivy League Professor. But hayes is arguing that he deserves a spot on the podium over someone like Chafee: (Chafee) has served in elected office for over 30 years, on all three levels, city councilman, mayor, senator and governor. I think lessig qualifies for a spot on the podium, but he does not deserve a spot over Chafee or even Webb. ",2,0,1444171183,1444725378
cvqmwyp,1,t3_3nm607,AnchorDTOM,"Thats absurd, lessig has dedicated 0 years of his life to public service. Chafee has over 30 years in public service, serving on all three levels of government. Who do you think deserves to be at a Political debate. Tell Lessig to run for governor, or mayor and see how he likes it... give me a break
