cvta65v,0,t1_cvt9whg,iamelben,Medicine is a subfield of biology. Just because he isn't a biologist doesn't excuse him from basic literacy in the fundamentals of his parent discipline. ,11,0,1444358363,1444725248
cvt9r1f,0,t1_cvt6goc,iamelben,"Bernanke has said before that the efficacy of short-term monetary policy is more affected by inflationary expectations than actual inflation. And he's right, because inflationary expectations are part of real interest rates, right? (I=i-π^e where I is real interest rates and i is nominal interest rates)
 
Thus:

lim( I ) = i 
π->0 

In other words, when inflationary expectations are close to zero, then nominal interest rates are going to be quite nearly real interest rates. 

Why is this important?  Because if inflationary expectations are either arbitrarily small or quick to adjust correctly, monetary policy is ineffective. You can think of interest rates as sticky in a way. More so in the aforementioned conditions. 

Creditworthiness has little to do with it.  Also, paying interest on reserves probably has a small distortionary effect as well. ",3,0,1444357654,1444725248
