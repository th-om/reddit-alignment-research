He shifted the setup to have many more training sessions compared to games (where on average each player only spends a few minutes on the ball).  For example, a lot of teams went from two/three practices a week with two games (or tournaments) on weekends to four practices and one game a week.  With less games theres less focus on how to get results in upcoming games during sessions and more emphasis on technical drills.  


I was playing competitive club soccer when this change was made and almost made the switch to my local academy for my last two years of high school and I noticed a significant change in the setup.  But the first generation to experience it from a young age is still years away (the system is only four years old) so it will take at least a few more years until we bear the fruits of his labors.

cvvin2t,0,t1_cvvi83s,dk1244973,Completely agree with you.  It's pretty clear that were still quite far behind the very best teams technically and (to a lesser extent) tactically.  It will take time for us to bear the fruits of the new youth set up with academies and whatnot,1,0,1444537449,1444721195

cvtrr0u,0,t1_cvtpav0,dk1244973,"Here's the thing: the accusation is from 2007 to 2009, when Messi was 19-21. I'm the same age and my dad handles all of my taxes, I don't know a thing about any of it and I'm a business student so I should at least somewhat understand. I know if I was in Messi's position I would trust my dad to handle all of that. 

It's pretty probably that his dad was aware (in which case he should serve his time) but entirely plausible that Messi left it to him without even questioning him. I'm sure the prosecutors agree, which is why they recommended dropping the charges against Lionel",7,0,1444404458,1444721195
