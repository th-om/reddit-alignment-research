3. I'm not allowed to answer lol.
4. My efedding experience was pretty horrible up to when I started this place. I started around 2009 and did two efeds at once because they were on the same forum that unfortunately no longer exists. I got along with the people who ran those places because I was a mod on the forum that hosted it (it was a general wrestling forum and we made sections for them because they wanted to efed). I did some booking for one of them for a while, but it kinda just died and people lost interest. I moved on to WWX and did *not* get along with the mark owners at all. I kept pitching them ideas and giving them suggestions for booking, but they never listened to me because all the ""vets"" ran the place and god forbid a rookie spoke up. If you weren't a 5+ year veteran or an ass kisser, chances are you weren't getting dick. I actually got banned for a while, took a break from efedding, then came back maybe a year or so later. I lurked on some efeds during my off period but they all sucked so I never joined one. After I left WWX again because the owners are retarded, I found PWR and joined that. That went well for a while, until again I started disagreeing with the owners on not only booking, but how the fed itself was run. They didn't listen to me because they had been there longer therefore they're like smarter than me somehow, so after a while of butting heads with them I said fuck it I can just make my own goddamn efed and I could run it the way I want, and the way I think is right. The rest is history.

By the way... Where's PWR now? Oh, yeah, what a shame. What's WiR? The best and one of the most popular efeds on the Internet, you say? What's up Remy, suck my dick.",5,0,1444525328,1444721894

**Billed From:** Chicago, IL

**Height:** 6'

**Weight:** 220 lb

**Character Description:** A gristled, well respected veteran on the independent scene. He's been notoriously controversial in and out of the ring, but is most well-known for his ability to combine technical prowess with stiff, high-impact brawling and ultraviolence. After years of putting his body through unimaginable torture, Hall is a (for the most part) a no-bullshit character willing to do anything and everything in his power to do whatever he sets his mind to. In the ring, he usually starts the match with a more technical approach, but normally ends up throwing that out the window as the match goes on, replacing it with hard hitting, high-impact brawling. He is known for being one of the most innovative and disgusting deathmatch wrestlers on the circuit, and has won several deathmatch tournaments all over the world throughout his career. He's basically a combination of Super Dragon and Masada.

**Appearance:** Moderately tall and built, long and unruly hair, and a giant beard to match. His arms and chest are covered in Satanic tattoos. He used to wear black MMA-style shorts, but because his in-ring days are behind him, now he wears ripped up camo cargo shorts, black kickpads and kneepads, and a John Hall t-shirt with the sleeves cut off. Black tape around the wrists and fists.

**Style:** Technical/brawler/ultraviolent

**Standard Moves:**

* Stiff kicks
* Leg lariat
* Various elbow strikes
* Snap suplex
* Various submissions
* Yakuza kick
* Back suplex
* Various suplexes

**Signature Moves:**

* Double stomp
* Neckbreaker swing into rolling elbow to the back of the head (often to counter a clothesline)
* Death Valley Driver
* Running boot scrape in the corner
* Camel Clutch (sometimes with a Dragon Sleeper)
* Backdrop Driver
* Super kick
* Powerbomb

**Finishing Moves:**

* *Harriman Driver* (Torture rack dropped into a piledriver)

**Entrance Music:** [Skinless - ""Merrie Melody""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG6J7zx0LpM)

**Entrance Description:** After the intro to the song, Hall comes out wearing a hoodie and a beige skullcap. He bangs on his chest, then his forehead, then throws up his middle finger and spits out a mist of water. He walks to the ring, climbs to the middle rope and does the pose again.

**Taunts:** Puts his finger behind his ear, as if to tell the crowd he can't hear them; middle fingers

**Game of Thrones Fan?:** Eh.

cvnaqin,1,t3_3mwr9a,brianwantsblood,"*We open to [a dimly lit parking lot](http://www.terrain.org/wp-content/gallery/to-know-a-place-seeing-the-light/empty-parking-lot.jpg). The dead of night makes it feel very dense. It is completely empty, except for a man with his back to the camera. He steps around aimlessly, looking around.*

**Man:** Ladies and gentlemen, my name…

*He turns around.*

**Man:** ...is John Hall.

*He cracks a smile behind a [mountainous beard and long, straggly, unkempt hair, held under a skullcap.](http://thecount.com/wp-content/uploads/safe_image-1.jpeg) He speaks with a slow, gravely voice.*

**Hall:** Some of you may not know who I am… Others may know me.. very well.

*His cadence is seemingly random – pausing briefly at random times, but it all feels calculated.*

**Hall:** Back in my day I went all over the world doing.. this. Saw the world on someone else’s dime doing.. what I loved. And it’s been almost two years since I’ve been in the ring. And it’s been the same amount of time… since I’ve been in a deathmatch.

*Hall continues to walk around, not really looking at the camera. He reaches into the pocket of his leather jacket and pulls out a pack of Newport 100’s. He pulls one out and quickly lights it. He doesn’t even take a full puff before he cuts himself off by continue to speak, almost as if he forgot what he was doing and couldn’t help himself.*

**Hall:** And I thought I was done! Last match, fans clap, ride off into the sunset.

*He takes a hit of his cigarette.*

**Hall:** But then… I got a call from an old friend…

*Another hit. He turns his head to the camera and stares a hole into it, relaxing his brows.*

**Hall:** One thing led to another and here I am… In WiR… And you know.. what I see? I see a bunch of kids, great wrestlers, granted, but…

*He wiggles his finger like there’s something on the tip of his tongue. He stops himself to take another hit of his smoke.*

**Hall:** They’re in over their heads… You all, well, you all have no idea what you’re getting into.. Heh.

*[Cough]*

**Hall:** I do.

*Hall turns his back to the camera and begins pacing a little bit quicker. As he continues to speak, he takes little hits of his cigarette in between words.*

**Hall:** I’ve gone through barbed wire, smashed through glass, electrocuted, set on fire, fucking ripped apart…!

*Freeing his hands, he puts his cigarette in his mouth and suddenly explodes by aggressively taking off his jacket. He walks up to the camera and rolls up the sleeve on his right arm, shoving a huge scar in our faces.*

**Hall:** And I have the scars… Stephen Alexander you’re a fool.

*[Cough]*

**Hall:** You and the rest of em… Trying to prepare yourselves.. hurting yourselves beforehand to.. get used to the pain. *(He begins to laugh to himself)* See I’ve gotten a little wise over the years… Let me tell you all something… a little secret.

*He takes another hit.*

**Hall:** You can’t get used to pain… You can’t harness it… You can’t control it… You can’t do a goddamn thing about it. And it’s not fun. Pain may be temporary, but scars…

*He looks down at the scar on his arm.*

**Hall:** Yeah I’m getting too old for this shit. You guys today… you’re all worried about other things. All this bullshit. My opponent in the first round went off on some fuckin’ grocery list of shit. Well guess what… I don’t give a fuck!

*He smiles and again begins to laugh to himself.*

**Hall:** I really couldn’t give two fucks. But you should… All of ya motherfuckers, listen to me right now. I’ve learned over the years a little secret about all this.. Cutting promos and Twitter and all this fuckin’ nonsense.. is all fine. But when you step into that ring, you may wanna show them and everyone, “woah, hey, look at me and how much pain I can take! Wah-ha, I’m so fucking tough! Chant my name, assholes!” No.

*He takes a hit while running his free hand through his beard, ripping it through any knots he runs into.*

**Hall:** No.. no. When you step in there with me… You want to avoid pain. How do you avoid? Little tip for ya – avoid by inflicting… It’s either me.. or you… You kids got a lot to learn… And I’m gonna teach ‘em. I’m gonna make men out of ‘em. Or women, fucking whatever.

*[Sniff]*

**Hall:** That’s why I’m here… That’s why I got the call. That’s why I agreed. That’s why I’m coming back after two fucking years… Because you guys need to be taught a lesson. This shit ain’t a joke. You don’t know if you’re gonna walk out of Delaware alive.. and Stephen, first round, October 10th… Be careful what you wish for, kid.

*He takes one more hit but stops himself and flicks it away. He immediately looks directly at the camera and speaks as smoke escapes his mouth.*

**Hall:** I’m gonna make a man out of Stephen Alexander. I will skin him alive and wear him as a jacket. Then I’m gonna humble whoever I get in the second round, whether it’s that crybaby Jack Anchor or that faggot Sonny Carson, I will walk into the finals with their head on a fucking *stick.*

*A slight breeze whistles past the camera.*

**Hall:** I’m winning this whole.. fucking.. thing. Because if you pussies can’t put this old fuck out of his misery… Well I guess it’s you or me, isn’t it?

*Hall takes his skullcap off and puts his face right in the camera. His forehead is covered in disgusting scar tissue from years of torture.*

**Hall:** I know it’s in you guys, I see it. I see it. I know it’s there. I see it! I smell it. I fucking taste it. And for the first time in two years… it tastes fucking good… Let it out… and let’s fuck this shit up.
