Just as an intro, fire management teams in Denver are selected at the beginning of the year. The team leader will have been preselected, and the corps members are chosen during initial training. You'll go through an interview process and a quick physical fitness test.

They help the regular guys burn during the winter, than transition to fuels mitigation in the spring and summer. Teams behave as a sort of on call half handcrew. Depending on the fire activity at your sponsor during your time there, you might gets lots of action or none.
