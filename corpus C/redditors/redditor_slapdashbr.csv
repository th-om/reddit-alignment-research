I mean sure, technically it does have 4GB of VRAM, and most of the time that doesn't matter. But they initially claimed it had 64 ROPs when in reality it only has 56. That's a significant difference in geometry performance  (AA quality, etc) that is an issue 100% of the time. ",2,0,1444704388,1444723057
cvxq4wb,1,t3_3oiy6n,slapdashbr,"upgrading the GPU might help but I think a 670 should still be capable of handling those games at 1080p. 

I used to have a radeon 7950 and it had no trouble running GTAV at 1920x1200, not totally max but with most settings at ultra and 2x MSAA. A gtx 670 is just about as fast and W3/FO4 should be about as difficult to run on PC. FO4 won't be that bad I think, honestly, if it is going to run on consoles, a powerful GPU like the 670 should have no trouble with it. 

The gtx 970 is only about 30-35% more powerful than a 670. I don't think it's worth upgrading to now. Wait for Pascal or whatever AMD puts out on 16nm later next year. 

The CPU is more than fine. ",7,0,1444704276,1444723057

Apple's competition is not microsoft. It is Dell, HP, lenovo, asus, etc. the people who put together complete systems, which happen to be windows-based. 

As someone who built my own desktop from individual parts, I don't get any sort of specific support, unlike what apple provides, or what Dell or those other companies will do if you have a warranty/service plan. But that's the only drawback and it saved me thousands of dollars... I mean seriously Apple marks up their hardware a ridiculous amount. ",1,0,1444688382,1444723057

A better CPU would help in certain games but the 1090T is still plenty powerful enough for most games that aren't really badly optimized. Good enough that it isn't worth replacing. The GPU is extremely important with high resolution. ",2,0,1444688141,1444723057
cvxfsh9,0,t1_cvxe9nn,slapdashbr,"That requires dual-booting and it isn't supported by apple. Besides which, what apple product is actually good for gaming? The laptops have laptop hardware. The only desktop Mac with truly powerful hardware is the mac pro, which is about 3x as expensive as it should be for the components. Configured with an i5-5820k and a pair of 6GB Tahiti GPUs (fire pro line- you'd probably have to hack the bios to radeon to get any decent gaming performance) it's just shy of $5000. You can build your own with equal hardware for under 2k. Apple products are not good for gaming even if you dual-boot windows. ",2,0,1444687943,1444723057
