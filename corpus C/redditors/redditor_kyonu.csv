cvwvtiu,0,t1_cvwvf69,kyonu,"I may be no expert, but someone before explained it like this:


When you go to the doctor to get an X-ray and maybe some pills, you have probably around 4 or 5 different doctors of departments taking a cut from what you are paying for that visit. So for each department, you have:


*Receptionist fills out paperwork

*Nurse fills out paperwork

*doctor fills out paperwork


So that's between 12 and 15 different people on payroll being paid for a single doctor visit, and is *extremely* cluttered.


With single payer, you have one visit, and just one person fronting the bill: The government. So you eliminate all of the overhead and just have one receptionist, nurse and doctor looking over you and your visit. So you reduce overhead from up to 15 people (or more) to 3 people.


That cuts a LOT out of the required cost.

The only thing I'm curious about is how we restructure the system so the other 12 people don't lose their job completely.",1,0,1444656880,1444729621

cvvdinj,1,t3_3oa5yt,kyonu,"Main reason... Healthcare. Everyone of my fam members and my GF are all suffering from *something*, yet we cannot afford to take care of them all. 


My GF has a chronic respiratory illness that prevents her from working, and it costs me a load of money to get her seen, and even then the doctors won't see her for months.


My mom and dad has heart, diabetes, joint and dental problems and cannot be seen without money they don't have.

I'm running myself ragged trying to afford support and get them the help they need, and am developing mental issues that I can't get looked at.


Mine, and my family's, only chance at beating this thing is getting the help we need for a decent price or no cost. This lead me to believe in Bernie, and will be voting for him.


I then found his other positions equal that of mine, which made it a no brainer in the end.",8,0,1444527634,1444729621

cvspzx2,0,t1_cvspha8,kyonu,"If he really has a problem with paying a lesser amount for national healthcare over paying a higher amount for personal healthcare, then he's really not thinking about this the right way, and there isn't really much you can do about someone who doesn't understand that a dollar is a dollar, regardless of where it goes to.

It really bugs me to no end when people are okay with paying hundreds a month for healthcare, but get all up in arms when they pay half or less a month and contribute to the largest humanitarian aide in the country... Super back-asswards.",1,0,1444326729,1444729621
cvsorek,1,t3_3nzicb,kyonu,"Well for one, Bernie's plan does not state whether or not it will require citizens to fork up anymore taxes. He does state, however, where he's getting money from, and chances are he will not increase the funds.

But here's what you ask your friend:

""How much are you paying on healthcare right now?"" The answer should be anywhere between 60 and 500 a month if he pays for his own healthcare.

Then, tell him, ""You will be saving that XXX dollars a month, and [if any taxes are presumed from Bernie's plan] by supporting this plan, you'll be paying less than XXX a month, AND you don't need to worry about copay, out of pocket expense, maximums, etc.""

In reality, you will save a LOT more money, even if you pay an extra 10% in taxes.

In that respect, would this also mean many of the republicans have similar issues, since Hillary's, far worse out of the Democrats, is better than all of the Republicans?
