And then, I thought about what the world would be like if women and women only were allowed to possess the key to incredible power? Wouldn't there be some contortion of gender roles? Yet, I would expect them to be different than they were presented in WoT.  ",7,0,1444678673,1444723958

Even in the most ""free"" society, someone will still need to be paid to come scrape you off the pavement and transport you to the morgue.

If you manage not to die, chances are pretty good that you get to take a ride in a helicopter to the nearest trauma unit, occupy the talents of a trauma team and then occupy a precious bed in the ICU unit.  Now, thanks to Obama, you probably have insurance so someone will probably pay for all that care, but that doesn't do much good for the poor sap who needs that helo, trauma team, or ICU bed because he was shot by a gunman on a college campus. 

As John Donne said, no man is an island.  We all end up paying for the stupidity of others one way or the other. ",2,0,1444422825,1444723958

GOP it is!

I'm usually pretty good about remembering that.  Maybe too much time writing ""GoT"" has instilled bad habits. Fixed it for you. ",0,0,1443199030,1444723958

If Bush I had beaten Clinton in '92, it wouldn't have been the end of the world.  If McCain had beaten Obama in '08, I could have lived with it (though I would have hoped against hope for his good health). 

But if any of the top 3 right now make it to the Whitehouse, it'll be hard not to label it anything short of the end of America as we knew it.  ",7,0,1443197620,1444723958

Aside from that, though, I do think that the best thing that could happen for the GOP Presidential candidates right now is for a quick budget to be struck that delays any potential showdown until after the election.  Not that the GOP is in the habit of doing things that are in its own best interests.  ",2,0,1443193703,1444723958
