Depression affects 6.9% of adults.
Anxiety disorders 18.1%
Bipolar disorder 2.6%
Schizophrenia 1.1%

All these are stats done by American government agencies and considered correct.  Nice infographic here: https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers

I doubt statistics vary much from country to country.

That is not what this was about. 

It was about you showing human decency and not calling other Redditors for retards and losers.  You have a pattern of that, bro. 

Try to treat others like you want to be treated.  The golden rule, dude!  That is where the real karma is, not Reddit karma.",0,0,1444712593,1444729885

Air Conditioner, what/where to buy? Any tips? by burnaskopen in indonesia
[â€“]martinsulistio -4 points 8 hours ago 
First we have this retard exemplar example of redditor who bitches about paid holiday by his dad because his dad is secretly plotting for him to have sex with his own wife.
Now we have socially challenged redditor who literally have no friends to talk to about buying AC, and have to resort asking anonymous people in the Internet for opinion.
Look bud, I hate to be in your shoes, but have you ever tried talking people whose face you can see and voice you can hear? I'm not judging you as pathetic, it's just the evidence is overwhelmingly certain that you are.
That being said, daikin is the way to go. Find price and model in big box electronic store then find small electronic shop and see if they can match delivery and installation fee. Get the unit that is made in Thailand as opposed to the ones made in China. They cost a little bit more but have better quality. Go with 3/4 pk (probably too much, but gading can be really hot).",1,0,1444704054,1444729885
