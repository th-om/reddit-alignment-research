cvwe386,0,t1_cvwbn15,arktouros,"I don't think you quite understood what I was saying. I was saying that even if there was a genetic component to brain development, it still isn't genetic because genes don't directly start or stop brain development - that is done through hormones. It could be that africans might naturally have a different hormonal cutoff, but that's a long stretch from saying it's genetic. Anywho, you have to show not only that it isn't environmental nor is it an issue of self-identity, but also that it isn't hormonal.",0,0,1444609178,1444725399

cvwdslx,0,t1_cvvuemy,arktouros,"> Raw IQ scores are lower pre-adulthood, for the same race/sex.

Are you talking of the actual mental age score? Because there's a huge jump you gotta make in order to get from correlation to causation, and you haven't ever put up a convincing evidence.

> You don't seem to understand the difference between raw and normalized IQ scores.

No, first you use raw scores, then you jump to normalized scores. It's crazy.",1,0,1444608599,1444725399

cvvsrob,0,t1_cvvhaxl,arktouros,"> It's not that shocking, as the average sub-Saharan African adult has a raw IQ score (not normalized) on par with the raw IQ score of an 11 year old Northern European.

It shouldn't be shocking that IQ favors children over adults of any categories. 

> That white 8th grader is around 14 years old and their raw IQ and brain will still be growing, whereas the black high school senior has likely already reached where his inherited IQ is going to be and his overall brain is almost done growing, so the latter can be roughly seen as an adult for these purposes.

So your saying growth development for africans stops sooner than whites? Even if that were true, which I highly doubt, it certainly wouldn't be a genetic issue; it would be a hormonal issue.

> Thus, there is only a three year difference between a pure and an American black to achieve raw IQ parity with whites, again due to that 20-30% European genetics.

The bigger factor is age. From what it seems, you've given blacks an inherent structural disadvantage and then based your conclusions of genetics, which still you haven't really shown causation rather than simply correlation.",3,0,1444572667,1444725399
