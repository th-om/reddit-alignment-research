cvu59cj,0,t1_cvto5gu,foilfenceru,"The basic construction of a sword is very simple.  
1. Find some cardboard. The best cardboard is two-ply refrigerator boxes or TV boxes. However if you want to make a smaller prop like a dagger or something, boxes you mail stuff in are just fine. Cereal boxes or the like won't work though, they're two thin. You'll also need masking or duct tape and a stick about the width of your pinky and almost as long as the sword you plan to make. Bamboo garden sticks work well for this as they are sturdy and straight.  
  2. Draw out the sword you want on the cardboard and cut it out with a box cutter. You can use scissors in a pinch but I wouldn't recommend it.
3. Trace the sword cutout onto the cardboard and cut it out again.  
4. Score the sword cutouts down the middle and bend them along the score. This gives the sword a more 3D look.   
5. Cut the stick or bamboo to be about 2 inches shorter than the sword. Tape the bamboo down the middle of one of the sword cutouts, along the score.  
6. Finally, tape the second side of the sword to the first. If you want to paper mach or paint it use masking tape. Rip small pieces off and pinch the edges of the cardboard together, than stick the tape around the edge.  
7. You're done! Enjoy your sword!

cvu49ka,0,t1_cvtlvov,foilfenceru,"Not OP but work at the same camp. If it rains hard the outer cardboard castle skin gets destroyed. I remember clearly a frantic morning trying to put a whole new skin of cardboard on the castle before the kids arrived. Besides that, the campers armor and weapons are stored safely under tents when it rains, and they get to use the camp weapons which are made of duct tape and plastic election signs to play games in the rain.",1,0,1444423276,1444723311
cvu3wt3,0,t1_cvtnj9j,foilfenceru,"This is actually pretty close to what we actually do. We give the kids ""camp weapons"" which are made of those plastic election signs covered in duct tape. The actual weapons that the campers make though are covered in masking tape and sometimes paper mached.",4,0,1444422662,1444723311
