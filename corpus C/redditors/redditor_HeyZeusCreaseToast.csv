cvwwo4f,1,t3_3oerzs,HeyZeusCreaseToast,"You are not alone in being a voter who is hard to reach through traditional advertising and this is presenting a large problem to campaigns - especially with it getting harder to reach voters through traditional means of voter outreach such as phone banking (more and more people have cell phones) and canvassing (less and less people are willing to open their doors to strangers).

That being said, the people who do watch traditional tv and read physical newspapers are usually the demographic most likely to vote (older populations) and so as of right now it still makes sense for campaigns to advertise in those mediums.",2,0,1444658703,1444719913
cvvvc7n,1,t3_3oby9r,HeyZeusCreaseToast,"Potentially.

As of right now, the Democratic Primary electorate can be boiled down into four sections (in reality it's more complicated than that, but for the sake of ease): Anti-establishment/Progressives (Bernie), Establishment (Hillary), Anyone-But-Establishment (Anyone-But-Hillary), Undecideds. Let's say the voting blocs breaks down to: 50% Establishment, 30% Progressive, 10% Anyone-But, and 10% Undecided. Bernie has a lock on the anti-establishment/Progressives vote, and, for the most part, the anyone but Hillary vote.

Now those two Democratic sections Bernie has are smaller in size than the Establishment vote, which is why Hillary doesn't view Bernie as much of a threat, or at least why she remains ahead in the polls. So at this point it looks like Hillary has 50% of the vote, Bernie has 40% of the vote, and 10% remain undecided. If Vice-President Biden were to enter the race, since he would be viewed as another Establishment candidate and has the potential to split or peel off some of Hillary's base of supporters, but also would pull some of the support from Bernie (the Anyone-but-Hillary crowd).

All that being said, a lot of Biden's support is ""soft"" - some of it is sympathy vote for his son, some of it is his ""Uncle Joe-ness"" and charisma and some of it is actual support. He is kind of a loose cannon and once he starts making gaffes and dropping ""Joe-bombs"" his support would probably drop quite a bit. You could feasibly see his support going to O'Malley (if he does well in the debates) but also going to Hillary and Bernie.

It's also really early in the election season, and quite a few Primary/Caucus voters aren't paying attention or found their candidate yet.",1,0,1444578239,1444719913

cvubhbh,1,t3_3o5sc6,HeyZeusCreaseToast,"To be blunt, foreign aid directly benefits the interests of the United States - both economically and security-wise. Because we live in a globalized world, the United States doesn't exist in it's own bubble, the events and happenings in one country can spill over or affect another in a variety of ways.

Foreign aid is given to countries and earmarked to be used in certain ways, but usually broken down into the three categories of economic, military/security, and humanitarian - and the countries that receive foreign aid *usually* are the most vulnerable and unstable areas of the world, such as Colombia, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Egypt. The two examples you gave (Germany and China) are two of the world's largest economies and able to repay loans without it damaging or hurting their economies.

One example of why foreign aid is important and in the best interest of the United States is why we give to Egypt. It is primarily used to keep peace in the region and to ensure that the Suez Canal - one of the busiest and economically important shipping routes in the world - remains open.

The argument is usually that we can pay a little bit now and address a country's problems while still small and localized, or we can pay a lot more in the future when the problem has grown and has gotten out of control and directly impacts our nation. The best current example of this rationale, and main driving force is, globalized terrorism.

Third parties in United States politics are a tricky beast. Recognizing the fact that the Democratic and Republican Parties are multi-billion dollar organizations, with an established and extensive system that goes far beyond what many people realize, they aren't going anywhere anytime soon.

While the Tea Party is certainly the most current political group to make waves in US politics, it came about in 2010 (or one could argue right after the Obama election) and in less than 2 years, was absorbed into the Republican Party. Typically, any new political party immediately gets absorbed into either the Democratic or Republican party. Third parties being absorbed into one of the major parties isn't a bad thing - it forces that Party to evolve and adopt new policies. And we have seen this with the Republican Party and the Speaker election.

Even if a politician identifies with a different party and wins - such as Bernie Sanders who runs as an Independent for Senate, or Angus King the Independent Senator from Maine, or Ron Paul who considered himself a Libertarian - they are forced to Caucus with one of the two parties because that is the only way to be a chair of a committee, which is where all the power is. Thus, Bernie Sanders Caucuses with the Democrats and is more or less a Democrat and Ron Paul is more or less a Republican.

The Tea Party actually holds more power working within the system and inside the GOP, rather than being an outside group opposing them and being view as an external threat.
