Most Republicans don't like each other, but Paul Ryan is relatively popular. He knows everyone, he understands what they want and how to write legislation that will meet all their needs. Any of them *could* do that (or hire someone to do the writing), but only Ryan is actually capable of doing so, or at least that's what many suspect.",1,0,1444416601,1444716953

Also, it's got a lot of stuff to do, which someone will have to do eventually. It'd be better to merge it with the Federal Redundancy Commission, so they could be combined.",9,0,1444341264,1444716953
cvszcaq,0,t1_cvssn3f,Eroticawriter4,"Rumors have been flying around conservative blogs since Boehner first announced his retirement: supposedly, McCarthy has been having an affair with Renee Ellmers, a Republican congresswoman from North Carolina. I'm not sure I believe it -- conservatives don't like McCarthy, and they hate Ellmers, so ginning up a fake scandal that took either or both of them down would be very popular. But rumors have been popping up all over the place, and I think that was what Jones was referring to.",6,0,1444340354,1444716953

In addition to your point, it seems that every time there's a debate about a free trade bill, the general agreement of economistfolk is that ""those other free trade bills kind of sucked, but free trade in general is good and this bill is good"". Which sounds logical, but why do I hear it every single time? Every free trade agreement sucks in retrospect, but the next one is always great and will surely fix those shitty ones from the past.",10,0,1444076829,1444716953
