cvxgxde,0,t1_cvxgq9a,fizolof,"Thanks for responding! I normally feel vary anxious about everything, I feel extremely lonely, I really want to have a connection with other people, and yet I feel extremely stressed and self-conscious when I'm around them. I guess that's pretty common nowadays? I've taken MDMA like and hour ago and it's pretty great right now. I genuinely have a will to live, which is not something I normally feel. I think I'll delete this comment after I'm done because of the anxiety that somebody will read it and judge me. :(

Do you want to get together and do MDMA sometime? :)",2,0,1444689740,1444718562
