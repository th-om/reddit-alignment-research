cvt7vyp,0,t1_cvruyy0,excalq,"It's definitely not fast or easy. I had a few false starts over a couple years, and each time (a few weeks) I did improve, however going back to Qwerty really hurt my progress. It really wasn't until doing a heavy few weeks of Dvorak typing tutor lessons, then physically rearranging my keyboard to Dvorak that I started feeling comfortable and fast. I still look at the keys a lot, but less and less. Fortunately most keyboards, including the MacBook are super easy to rearrange. Having a Qwerty layout even in the corner of my eye  made it very difficult to think ""in Dvorak"", not to mention making passwords impossible to type.

If I had to start all over again, I'd probably chose an easier to learn layout like Colemak or Workman. Still, I'm quite glad I made the switch.",1,0,1444354667,1444724361

cvrt9g0,1,t3_3nucom,excalq,"I recently fully switched to Dvorak (after quite a while of going back and forth). It definitely makes using vim awkward though. ""d"" being where ""h"" was is particularly an issue. Oh well, it's still worth the ergonomics. I'm curious what other vim+Dvorak users do. ",4,0,1444256322,1444724361
