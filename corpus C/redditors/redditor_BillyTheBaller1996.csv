Could you elaborate on that and why it's good please? ",1,0,1444721620,1444726964
cvxxdzm,0,t1_cvwkq1m,BillyTheBaller1996,">68 different lenders said we were great, property was great they just weren't lending less than a couple million

They wouldn't lend less than a couple million dollars? What happened in the credit crisis? I've heard vaguely about it. 

If you don't mind me asking, how much did you pay for your property and how much do you make off of it? And what are the negative and positive aspects of it? 

And why would repeating this drive you nuts? Do you do anything besides own the property? ",1,0,1444721496,1444726964

Would it be useful to look at housing markets that are traditionally more steady than a place that had massive increases in price recently (silicon valley)? Is that a useful strategy? ",1,0,1444720471,1444726964
