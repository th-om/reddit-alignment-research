cvnsl22,0,t1_cvnm3wg,Boone727,"Someone who isn't a strict constitutionalist believes that the Constitution contains many implied powers and can be interpreted in the light of modern issues without requiring revision. This is not a new view either, and many founding fathers believed this, most notably Alexander Hamilton. It's not ""just a list of suggestions that don't really mean anything"", it's a list of ideas and principles that are to be applied to modern situations and problems. ",1,0,1443970309,1444727109
cvndim7,0,t1_cvncy2l,Boone727,"I wasn't arguing for anything pragmatically. You seem to have your reasons for why you oppose gun control, but that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the logic of the specific argument that was given above. If you have a reason for why the cutoff should be where you believe it should be then I'm happy to hear it, but unless you actually support legalizing all weapons don't say you do. I don't have an argument supporting the idea that ""semi-automatic, non-crew serve weapons"" are beyond the scope of the Constitution, but I also don't have one for tanks, which is why by itself it's a poor argument. Unless you can elaborate why you believe this weapon is ok and that one is not, then you need to take another look at your underlying philosophy. This goes for both sides.

cvnbzjf,0,t1_cvnanhj,Boone727,"I'm not actually talking about voting at all right now, just gun laws. My point was just that unless you advocate for letting people buy tanks and rocket launchers and nukes it's hypocritical to say you support no restrictions on the right to bear arms, because you clearly do. You just disagree with gun control advocates at where the cutoff point should be, unless there's something about the second amendment that makes it specifically about guns that I'm missing. I'm generally supportive of gun rights, but I've never liked that argument because when taken to its logical extreme it leads to policies I view as dangerous. Honest question: do you believe there should be no restrictions on weapons whatsoever?  ",0,0,1443921543,1444727109
