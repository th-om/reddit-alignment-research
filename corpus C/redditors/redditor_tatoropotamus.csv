cvxktne,0,t1_cvxkorx,tatoropotamus,"Well, the words ""fucking crazy"" are uncalled for and there is a historical precedent for raising the minimum wage. I wouldn't call the idea crazy, but economically tenable? The fact that it's met with so much resistance, particularly from economists, proves the opposite. I'd say there is a middle ground in this debate - somewhere above $7.25 but below $15 - and insisting on achieving $15 isn't realistic, at least not right now. But I've always thought the minimum wage should be tied to inflation, anyway..",1,0,1444696079,1444723549

cti4xrz,1,t3_3eg73l,tatoropotamus,"Czech banks use all three interest calculation methods for their products. These methods differ depending on the type of product. Deposit accounts generally use the English method, while credit accounts mainly use the French and German methods. However, banks such as AirBank a. s., ZUNO BANK AG or mBank S. A. deviate from this standard, as they calculate the interest of their products using only the English method.

*** i have no idea what that a. s. or S. A. jazz is, so i can't confirm it's right. 



In case Czech banks include interest on their bank products, customers should be pay attention to the interest rate and other indicators, such as interest calculation methods. Even if two banks offer the same product, the calculated interest might not be the same. This fact is not only influenced by bank fees, but also by interest calculation methods, too.

cti4ows,0,t1_ctdn0hu,tatoropotamus,"I agree with this. I started to edit the document, but I had to stop because my work break ended. Overall, though, I got the sense that it's all talk and no show. A college essay hinges on the ability to *show* something instead of directly stating it. /u/thenetworka, what did you actually do to improve your grades? Describe the nights you stayed up studying -- not because you procrastinated an essay due the next day, but because you were so eager to learn about the topic that you *couldn't* sleep. 


You have to do more than essentially say you tried and it didn't work,  but you've at least tried, so you should be admitted. They want to see you've changed. Maybe you realized your old approach to learning didn't work, and now you're eager to try a new learning style in an environment better suited for you. 

Also, there's way too much begging at the end. It doesn't show confidence -- a skill everyone looks for these days.

I hope this advice helps. I'll come back to this essay later today or tomorrow if I can find time. ",1,0,1438026769,1444723549
