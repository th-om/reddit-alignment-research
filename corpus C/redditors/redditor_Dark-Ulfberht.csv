Last year was close, but the trend is very much on the side of the US. And, we're doing it with a much bigger baseline.",13,0,1444696180,1444723275

I just try to call a spade, a spade.",2,0,1444691056,1444723275

Better yet, compare the aggregate costs of accidents due to faults a safety inspection would have found against the aggregate of tickets for inspection violation and inspections themselves.

Your livelihood is based on nothing more than rent seeking. Just be honest with yourself about that.",-2,0,1444679770,1444723275
cvt6ush,0,t1_cvrqbsw,Dark-Ulfberht,"Really?

This guy tells a story that is common as fuck: subsidized housing moves in; crime skyrockets.  Have a look at [this](https://www.ncjrs.gov/app/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=145329).  Is it so hard to admit that OP's story is not uncommon, and that it doesn't necessarily make him some kind of race warrior?",3,0,1444353014,1444723275

What's up /u/NOTORIOUSD?  Is it so hard to admit that moving subsidized housing into a neighborhood will likely result in increased crime in said neighborhood?",2,0,1444352755,1444723275

cvs17o5,0,t1_cvrxw5o,Dark-Ulfberht,"I wouldn't place blame on business leadership. At the end of the day, they must provide a good or service at a price someone will pay. If a competitor does it cheaper, they risk losing revenue. If this goes on long enough, the business becomes unprofitable and dies.

It's really that simple.

To find blame, look in two places: (a) well connected conglomerates that hold sway over politicians who go on to craft regulation that emplaces barriers to entry and creates unnatural market conditions and (b) the parasitic finance industry.

It's easy to see a rich CEO who lays off employees and conclude he is the enemy.  However, he is simply acting in his company's interests. Look instead to those entities who bring literally no value to society and are yet its wealthiest members.",-2,0,1444269618,1444723275
