cvxp613,0,t1_cvxocug,sunthas,"hmmm. Anything that goes against what most American's believe. Blunders or gaffs that have no basis in reality. Stuff about abortions never being allowed, even in rape cases... or talking about undoing what the supreme court did with gay marriage. These things might work in a primary, but will tank the candidate in a general. The benefit the republicans have is that America in general is right of center. But so are the democrats...

I think if a candidate stands infront of a DebtClock at a rally it might get some of the base rallied up, but it doesn't resonate with the general population. It's not going to make or break his run, so I guess if he can get some people riled up with it to donate then props. But your original comment indicated that you thought the current debt load of the US would cost Obama a 3rd term. The problem anyone has on the right running against Obama is that he isn't that far left, wall street has done great under Obama, Obamacare is really a handout for the insurance & health industry, etc, and the things younger people would like to see him skewered for is liked by both sides. NSA Wiretapping, Snowden, Drone Strikes. Any talk about how the middle class has staggered while the rich get richer is something both sides will claim to have solutions for.

I'd be okay with a balanced budget amendment, but I don't think our debt it a top 10 issue that will make or break a presidential run. Good thing to talk about during the primary I guess?",1,0,1444698139,1444720920
