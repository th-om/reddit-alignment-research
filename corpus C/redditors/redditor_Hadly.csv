cvdwlwo,0,t1_cvdvv2c,Hadly,"Not sure how old the article you found was, but one junior Conservative member was charged and convicted, currently appealing.

>Former junior Conservative staff Michael Sona was ""charged with having wilfully prevented or endeavoured to prevent an elector from voting at an election"".[201] Sona is the only Conservative to be charged with any crime related to any robocalls, and in August 2014, he was found guilty of one violation of the Elections Act.[202] The trial judge concluded that it was unlikely that Sona acted alone in the commission of the offence.[203][204] Justice Gary Hearn sentenced Sona to 9 months of imprisonment and 1 year of probation. He described Sona's actions as 'an affront to the electoral process'.[205][206] The sentence is currently under appeal.[207][208]

The way the C's run their party, it's entirely top down.  If this person is indeed guilty, they were told from someone higher up to do it.",0,0,1443199523,1444724336
cvdv07r,0,t1_cvdnfnz,Hadly,"Are you Canadian?  Not asking to be a dick, genuinely curious.

If not, I suggest you look up the Senate spending scandal currently ongoing.  Many of our Senators (which are appointed, lifetime positions usually given to party insiders by the PM) are being investigated by the RCMP for their spending habits.  One in particular was paid 90,000 out of the pocket of Harper's top aide in order to cover expenses he was fraudulently claimed and was forced to pay back.

His party, and members of it, were also taken to court and proven guilty of massive electoral fraud from the last federal election.",0,0,1443197034,1444724336

In terms of the economy, Canada's economy used to be far more robust, but now oil exporting is a major export.  Even though the only oil we have is locked away in the tar sands that requires crazy destructive methods to extract it.",-1,0,1443149718,1444724336
cvdbfps,0,t1_cvd905d,Hadly,"Harper is worse.  Harper is Dick Cheney.  Bush was just a puppet for forces behind the curtain.  Harper is those forces.

The way our system works means that he essentially has absolute power to do what he wishes.  He keeps his party silent, no one falls out of line.  He muzzles scientists and has completely made the Canadian economy reliant on oil and tarsands.

Trust me, he's worse.",5,0,1443147021,1444724336
