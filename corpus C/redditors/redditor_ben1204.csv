To address some of your points

>She built and maintained a coalition to enact the toughest sanctions in Iran’s history.

Is this really a good thing? Tough sanctions in my opinion often don't work, see Cuba for instance.

>Supported the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice.

Well how much of a role did she play in it? If I recall correctly it was Pannetta who did a lot of it, but I'm not too knowledgeable on this.

>Helped avert war in Gaza by negotiating a ceasefire between Israelis and Palestinians.

Only after in the Senate, voting to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

>Played a role in bringing one war to an end and planning for the end of another.

I don't really like the Obama adminstration ended two wars line of thinking. Iraq was on a timetable already in place, and he expanded involvement in Afghanistan before ending it. 

>She worked to build the coalition to oust Qadhafi and stop massacres in Libya.

Libya is an absolute disaster now. Plus, the President should have asked Congress for permission to strike.

>Engaged in economic statecraft.
Brought the State Department into the 21st Century.
Secretary Clinton elevated the cause of women’s rights to new heights.

These are all pretty vague.

Most of your points are from a foreign policy perspective-I counter to you that her foreign policy mistakes are many-for instance, she advocated arming Syrian rebels, voted for Iraq. [Please read more here](http://swampland.time.com/2014/01/14/hillary-clintons-unapologetically-hawkish-record-faces-2016-test/).

Then of course there's tons of non-foreign policy issues, like her voting for Bush's bankruptcy bill and defending her husband's 1990s welfare ""reforms"". Truth be told, I absolutely hate the Clintons as a progressive-they've sucked the soul out of the Democratic Party in my view.

She has an extensive resume, but her job stints have not been too good in my view. 

In addition, I find her to be opportunistic, pandering, and calculating. Sort of like the female democratic Mitt Romney.

cvxdwxm,1,t3_3ohwfj,ben1204,"I'm in support of this bill. While there are a few amendments that need to be fixed (type-o's, etc), it's a good idea. People may think DC too small to give two Senators-let us remember, though, that Wyoming and Vermont are both smaller than the District of Columbia. 

One more amendment-Congress can override state laws already, DC or not-Supremacy Clause. How it works with DC is that the laws are subject to Congressional approval for 90 days (I think 90), a review period, where if Congress decides not to approve the laws, they may do so. If nothing is done after this period, the DC statutes become law. What I would suggest is clarifying S3A .",1,1,1444685024,1444718020
