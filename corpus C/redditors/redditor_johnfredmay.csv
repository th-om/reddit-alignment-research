cvamiqh,1,t3_3lxleg,johnfredmay,"Claiming that you're DF'd will certainly keep them away for a while, but after a year or two you'll end up with a couple of Elders at your door asking if you've had a change of heart and want to start the process of reentering the congregation. You then get to either continue your fabrication or tell them that you're not really a former JW.

The better way to keep J-Dubs away is simply to tell them directly that you have no desire to speak with them and to be permanently added to their **Do-Not Call List**. The publishers that you are speaking with will note it on the back of the territory card and will have an Elder initial it. They might eventually come back, but only if they think that you have moved away.

They're trying to win, but the divided nature of their party is making it hard in national elections. They're doing great when they only have to cater to a smaller, more homogenous, base. ",1,0,1442553424,1444723838

Here's a quick list of popular choices in the area curated by the city of Bend: http://www.visitbend.com/Bend_Oregon_Activities_Recreation/Three-Sisters-Scenic-Bikeway/

The McKenzie Pass route leaves straight from Sisters, but the route up to Mount Bachelor is incredibly popular with locals.

Good luck!",7,0,1440816653,1444723838
cttaida,1,t3_3fys9e,johnfredmay,"I would just move into the COCC library. It's summer term, and it will be pretty empty. Nobody will hassle you for being there. 

Head to the back of the second floor, and you'll have a great view and (probably) complete privacy. Drinks and snacks are ok, and the cafeteria next door is cheap and tasty. 

Have a great time in town!",9,0,1438840400,1444723838

http://hoodoorecreation.com/deschutes-campgrounds/

Many of the campgrounds allow for reservations, if you know your exact timetable. They will all be dog friendly, as long as your dog is on a leash or well-behaved enough to stay in the site. If you'd like recommendations about a particular campground, let me know what your interests are and I can help you narrow it down. 

Have fun! It's beautiful here. ",5,0,1435809707,1444723838

They're a bit pricey to get started.. the basic rack is about $600 and the mount are each $100+, but well worth it. ",1,0,1432164312,1444723838

If they fail to secure funds from a friendly source, they always have the option to borrow money with an interest rate attached. There is always someone willing to you loan money if you have collateral or credit worthiness.",2,0,1432095192,1444723838
