cvx3e36,1,t3_3ogs5x,233C,"Well, the TMI accident scenario was known in the safety case, and it worried the engineers because it was the only situation where the plant behaved the very opposite to normal: in case of leaks, the water in the pressurizer drops, except if the leak is at the pressurizer, then it will increase. The operators did what they were trained to do: level rises = reduce the water coming in. The inquiry later concluded that the operators were ""over trained but under qualified"".   
Also few month before TMI another US plant had a related incident (pressurizer valve stuck open) and corrected it, but the information wasnt shared between concurrent companies. Which lead to the creation of [INPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Nuclear_Power_Operations)   
Or when Lithuania (i think) corrected one of the bad design of RBMK (Tchernobyl type reactor), the tip of the control rods being made of moderating material rather than poison meant that when inserted, before having a negative effect, they had a positive one (no big deal in normal ops, but in emergency can make all the difference). (Tchernobyl lead to the creation of [WANO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Association_of_Nuclear_Operators)
