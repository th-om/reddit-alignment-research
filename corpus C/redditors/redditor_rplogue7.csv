cvlrkih,0,t1_cvk2u53,rplogue7,"I'm an adult, I'm entitled to my opinion as much as you are, and just because you don't know how to argue without being biased doesn't mean that I'm wrong. Please stop with this it is really getting old..",1,0,1443800490,1444720841
cvlaqf7,1,t3_3n5tut,rplogue7,"Honestly, you may hear from someone that is socially a democrat that this was an act of 'terrorism' simply to mask the fact that terrorism is directly related to radical Islam. They really love to support Islam, especially if they can blame a white person at the same time.

Truly disgusted with this situation overall.",-3,0,1443754401,1444720841

The only thing that you'll accomplish is sounding like the king of bias and prejudgement himself, Joe Biden.",1,0,1443666186,1444720841
cvjc08i,0,t1_cvj64to,rplogue7,"Saying that ""you've been in my situation"" doesn't entitle you to anything because in reality, you haven't been in my situation. From my experience, hard work will never *not* pay off. If you work hard, and are dedicated to get what you're striving for, it will pay off. The problem with today's America is that people get discouraged too much and think that it's not fair. They think that it's a right to succeed, when it's not. *Work Ethics.*",1,0,1443625480,1444720841
cvj0agr,0,t1_cviuoks,rplogue7,"Yes, terrible work ethics indeed. I've known several people in their 20's who's parents told them NOT to get jobs because they would receive less benefits without a legal dependent under them.

You can't knock me from an argument because I'm eighteen. You don't know me, my knowledge in economics, math, my background, and therefore your prejudice is irrelevant to this argument. Simply *ignorance* at it's finest.",0,0,1443591219,1444720841
cviuact,0,t1_cvbx9zh,rplogue7,"The main thing that I'm getting at here, we cannot go too far in to debt and simply assume that the economy will get better and we will be able to pay it off. Paying it off means not only paying taxes, but using less taxpayers dollars than incoming in the budget (Woah, is that even possible??...) 

Having said that, when it comes to the 'ultra wealthy', you cannot simply blame them for the income gap in the economy. We have a lower class without work ethics, and will happily live off of the government without contributing ANYTHING to it. No tax payments, no contribution to businesses, just complete loss of loaned money.

Bottom line, the country will succeed and 'be great again' (I'm not a Trump guy but hear me out) when more than 54% of people pay taxes. 46% of America doesn't pay taxes, that's approximately 100 million people, and if they were to work a job that were not shipped overseas, per say, and paid just $1,000 in taxes per year, that is an extra $100 billion dollars in revenue. Keeping in mind that $1,000 per year is less than what I contribute at just 18 years old, I think this country is capable of balancing a budget and maintaining a successful economy if the lower class has a chance to work for it.

We just have to stop complaining about the rich and stop blaming them for their overwhelming success which has somehow caused you to fail. No.",0,0,1443578779,1444720841
cvittx4,0,t1_cviti3q,rplogue7,"I feel the same way. The political parties have tried too hard to recruit support, and are involving social issues with their values when they really shouldn't. Being Pro-Life and Christian doesn't make you 'pure', and being Pro Gay-Marriage and PP doesn't make you a 'freedom advocate'. When it comes to social issues, I really don't think that your opinions should put you on either side of the table.",5,0,1443577977,1444720841
cvbro6x,0,t1_cvbo02j,rplogue7,"Well I mean, I'm not throwing anyone under the bus, but all of the government money that anyone receives is coming directly from a loan which is generating more debt. 

With the rise in debt to fund that money, will the investment eventually help pay it back through taxpayer money? If so, how well are we doing it? How efficient is our entitlement money being dispersed?

It just seems like, on a federal level, It can't be efficient enough.",0,0,1443039790,1444720841
cvbqqq9,1,t3_3m23ei,rplogue7,"Honestly, there is no way he will 'keep his promise'. In order for him to pass anything through, it's got to go through the representatives, and I can tell you right now that most of them won't be on board with socialistic views like his. It's just the way things will be. Four, even eight years will not give him enough time to execute what he's saying he will do in his presidency with the law making system we have right now.",1,0,1443038494,1444720841
