It might be useful for the doctors here to know how long ago the operation was performed. Also if you've ever seen a gastroenterologist. Or have a history of this type of stomach pain.

cvxu1bx,0,t1_cvxs5su,REJECTED_FROM_MENSA,"I found that last part pretty interesting. The US is a big place so I won't presume to speak for the whole country. But there is some notion of autonomy in filling your own tank. Even more generally, I think Americans tend to prefer doing things yourself rather than having someone else do it for you.  I would even go further to say that some would even see solicitation of simple luxury services as a nuisance if it slows you down. Many of us are always in a hurry and as far as I can tell, self serve is oftentimes shorter and more efficient than full serve as there are typically payment terminals built into the pumps.

cvxrhky,0,t1_cvxqhvx,REJECTED_FROM_MENSA,"Good point. I agree with that but would ask given how often people ignore these warnings, how likely are these sort of events? Do they happen often enough to justify passing laws that, depending on your interpretation of the data, restrict the freedoms of consumers at the pump? Of course, reasonable people can differ on this but the costs and benefits must be weighed according to the circumstances.",1,0,1444706487,1444729561

cvx948u,0,t1_cvx8fn6,REJECTED_FROM_MENSA,"It works here.

The original fallacy goes: A boy breaks his dad's window. Dad is mad because he has to pay to replace the window, but others think the boy did well because now Dad has to pay the repairman to fix the window. Maybe the repairman uses that money to buy something, stimulating the economy.

Here the window (thing that already works) is self-serve pump. It is being ""broken"" by the NJ legislature -- only producing a maintenance cost, which does not lead to productive value ",14,0,1444678217,1444729561
