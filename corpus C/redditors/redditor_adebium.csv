If you do as you suggest and ensure the fan isn't blowing directly on the vials, you should be fine. For the fridge I assume you are looking at something like [this](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Igloo-2.8-cu-ft-Refrigerator-Black/19895942).  Second picture shows EnergyStar label which states it uses ~300 kWh of energy. So less than 1kWh per day. To determine the exact load you can put fridge on a meter that records power usage like [this](http://www.amazon.com/P3-P4400-Electricity-Usage-Monitor/dp/B00009MDBU). This would allow you to figure out exactly how much power you need and get solar panels/batteries that fit your need. ",1,0,1443986560,1444718536
cvl3too,0,t1_cvkyn5s,adebium,"It is designated to treat or be investigated to treat an orphan disease. It is NOT considered an orphan drug (and the market exclusivity) until the company files an NDA and receives approval for the drug. Market exclusivity is granted in part by a guaranteed 7 year patent post approval. At the end of 7 years is it an orphan drug anymore? NO, it is designated to treat an orphan disease but is not an approved orphan drug. Other companies can now file with the FDA to manufacture generics of that drug. 

I repeat myself so maybe some of it seeps in. I tried giving you the benefit of the doubt but you can't even appreciate the FDA website lists it as NOT orphan drug approved. I have corrected every erroneous assertion you have made with verifiable links yet you still seem to not want to listen.

> Market exclusivity through, Tax incentives. Enhanced patent protection and marketing rights. Clinical research subsidies. Creating a government-run enterprise to engage in research and development.

and this statement is false. It has market exclusivity through distribution chain restriction. It has no enhanced patent protection since it is no longer under patent. You say it above that it was under patent until the 70's. If a generic wanted to market daraprim in the US all it has to do is file an application and await FDA approval. No company has done that in the past because the market for it is so small that the return on investment would not make it financially viable to apply in US. 

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_Drug_Act_of_1983#Regulatory_harmonization

This has nothing to do with the current topic. All it is saying is that US and EU (largest markets for drugs) will use the same application formats. It even says that approval is still separate between US and EU, therefore any orphan status designated in EU may not be applicable to US and vice versa. 

Finally [Orphan Designation Status](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions/HowtoapplyforOrphanProductDesignation/ucm364750.htm) is for the FDA to designate a drug treats a specific rare disease. This is done before a submission is made for approval. It sets in place the process for assigning orphan drug status BUT does NOT infer orphan status. The drug must still be approved by FDA. This is the difference between designation and approval status. So for the last time (I hope) [Daraprim](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/OOPD_Results_2.cfm?Index_Number=232206) is NOT an Orphan drug as its orphan approval status is 
> Not FDA Approved

Clear as mud, right?

Daraprim is manufactured by Turing. ExSAR Corp (link sends to Zywie Bio site). 

Zywie Bio used daraprim in a clinical trial as a pharmacological chaperone, in combination with its proprietary drug in a single clinical trial. Zywie does not manufacture or sell Daraprim on its own. Part of applying for a clinical trial is filing an IND with the FDA. Part of that IND is applying for Orphan Drug Status for the product (it sets up the eventual orphan drug designation at time of commercialization). Again, the link you provided is for a clinical trial, not a commercial product. Big difference.

For the sake of argument, if daraprim is an orphan drug, as you suggest, what does Turing get out of it's orphan drug designation?
