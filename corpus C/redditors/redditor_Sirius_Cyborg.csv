cvilvun,1,t3_3mvwys,Sirius_Cyborg,"Electric Guitars are normally compressed from the overdrive/tubes/amp naturally.  

You generally compress tracks that fluctuate in volume, that need to be solid in volume.  A consistent bass, vocal, and snare level are very important so you compress to achieve that.  

Bass dies down if the note is held out, and you don't want that.  The voice changes in volume on different syllables so you want to make it even.  Snare hits are very variable, so for hard hits on the backbeat, you want it consistent so you compress so that the loud is always the same.",3,0,1443564145,1444731680
cvhkdz5,1,t3_3mrazn,Sirius_Cyborg,"Good luck.  Being a studio musician with a steady gig means being one of the best players in your city.   

Try to contact a record producer/bigger studio in your town offering your services.  Odds are they might want to hear you play, and if you're good they might book you for a session.  Your first session is very important, as it's your first impression with the producer, engineers, and the artist.  If you kill it, you're on your way.",2,0,1443488475,1444731680
