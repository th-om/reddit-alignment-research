The Missouri campus is a botanical garden. Seeing as how fall is here, it won't be as impressive as it is when it's warm, but it's a beautiful campus for sure.

The Columns on the Quad are the second-most photographed thing in Missouri, after the arch.

There's a museum to the left of the columns that is pretty impressive, IMO.

If you have a car and don't mind a 10 minute drive through some backroads my favorite place to take people is Coopers Landing. It's a bar on the Missouri River, beautiful place.

Let me know if you have any more questions!",1,0,1444051494,1444718410
