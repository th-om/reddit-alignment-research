cvxrm42,0,t1_cvxr62l,President-Jeb-Bush,"I have no idea, it's not like they come out and announce such things. However, it's a common topic / theory in such threads (people have also claimed to troll through users' post history and see them commonly post on places like /r/conservative, however not having actually done the internet sleuthing myself I couldn't tell you for sure) and if I were (1) a superpac with a $50m budget or (2) a 16-year-old with tons of time on his hands who really hated Dems, I would definitely be on reddit doing these things. There are way too many eyeballs here to ignore (that's why we have prominent politicians doing AMAs here). 

> Reading comments from random internet people on Reddit is supposed to swing the election?

It's all a numbers game anyway, every hundred yard signs are worth X votes, every TV advertisement is worth Y votes, etc... You do enough different things and it makes a difference. ",1,1,1444706710,1444720513
cvxnwo0,1,t3_3oiw2c,President-Jeb-Bush,"Lets see, pick the reason that sounds best to you:

* Secretary Clinton doesn't come across as the most warm and kind person in the world. 
* The Republicans' attacks on her have been happening for so long many just assume they're true at this point. 
* She's only the 11th most liberal Senator in the Senate, while internet users on a lefty forum of an internet blog are going to tend to be much more idealistically closer to the radical left.
* Some portion of the users on /r/politics masquerading as Sanders supporters are in fact ultra-Conservatives out to ""poison the well water"" so as to help the eventual Republican nominee.

However, none of these are the real reason IMO. I personally think it's a bit more complicated. Essentially, IMO it's a byproduct of Reddit itself. Most users don't actually read the articles, they just read the headlines and/or comments. Additionally, most titles are chosen to be the most ""click-baity"" to attract views and are often misleading or straight up false. This is nothing new and a sad reality of the click-viewership ratings system that are in place for the internet. 

So what you end up having is the most extreme way any news can reasonably be interpreted getting used as the title and most people don't read anything else. So a lot of misinformation gets spread around. A while back I would report / note in the comments at every article that had an inaccurate title but it got nowhere. In the comments people would point out that this was the title in the article, so it didn't really matter that it was misleading / false. And the Admins (in some subs) are either overworked or don't care that much about making things clear to those just window shopping. 

Anyway, I could keep explaining but I'm a bit more interested to see if Keenan Allen will start getting some action (so far on fantasy he's putting up a goose egg). I'm sure you get where I'm going with this, so we'll just do the tl;dr version from here on out: (1) people read the titles but not the articles (2) Reddit users use Reddit as their source of news (3) the titles are misleading and have a bias (4) half-truths / lies get taken as fact (5) people start to believe the defamatory statements about her (6) people form a bad opinion of the stuff about her (7) they then upvote the stuff that then confirms this bias (8) the bias is reinforced and expanded upon.

cvxct9l,0,t1_cvwuwwd,President-Jeb-Bush,"To be fair, even if you think Governor Jeb Bush shouldn't be in the White House, that doesn't mean that some future Bush (who may not even be born yet) shouldn't hold the office.

What you're describing is just pure prejudism. You can hate GW and Bush Sr. as President, you can hate the prospects of Jeb! as President, but to say that an entire people shouldn't be President based solely on who their parents were is wrong. 

There was a thread on /r/Politics a day or two ago about how Carlson said (and was taken out of context btw) that a Muslim shouldn't be President. The thread was littered with comments (correctly) noting that this was absurd and we shouldn't make such decisions based on something that person can't control.

However, all the TPP does is make the current United States copyright law the ""standard"" moving forward. So for us here in the United States, it's actually not a change in the copyright law.

Also, there's the fact that this treaty may make it harder in practice for the United States to enact another copyright term extension act when Mickey Mouse goes into the public domain in a few years.",1,0,1444593647,1444720513

And then you're hiding under the guise of ""what if it comes up during a debate and she supports it then"" or ""what if her Pac was creating attack ads about it"" (neither of which happened). Again that means nothing. IF she supported it in response to a debate question or directed her pac to attack then-Senator Obama on the issue that's one thing, but neither ever happened. 

What we do know happened is that Clinton NEVER suggested that Obama was born outside the United States. Your reply is merely an attempt to create a narrative of deception and underhandedness for Clinton where there is none (in at least this specific case). It's a  patently false attack on her character and I'm merely calling you out on it. ",0,0,1444506378,1444720513
