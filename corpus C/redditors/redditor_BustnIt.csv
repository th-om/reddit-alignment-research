Nah. Coutesy is very important, no arguing about that. But you need to draw the line somewhere.

cvux49m,0,t1_cvuhpo9,BustnIt,"This is true. But did you notice that nobody claimed differently?

The comment was, *""let the taxpayers deal with the expense""*.

Unless you meant that the government doesn't hand out money to the deceased.

But if you consider families of mass shooting victims to be collateral victims of the same event, then *the government absolutely does assist with related expenses*. They don't assist with cash payments, but they do provide services and other resources.

My personal direct knowledge is limited to the 12/14/12 event, and services and other resources are still being provided to this day.

I'm only assuming that other mass shootings are handled in a similar manner.",1,0,1444497166,1444728822

Wait a minute. [Last week she told Chuck Todd](http://newsone.com/3200974/loretta-lynch-feds-should-not-require-cops-report-fatal-shootings-of-civilians/) 
she didn't want the federal gov. to dictate police violence/shooting reporting standards to the states.
