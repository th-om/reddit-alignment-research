If someone can have their abortion without serious qualms, and many seem to (and I think some of the guilting tactics of the extreme wings of pro-life are disgusting), then the only person who is on the wrong end of that won't be able to complain about it anyways. However, our society (American) has some glaring holes in sex education, access to contraceptives, and crucially in adoption support. As I said, if the state becomes pro-life, then it should create a quality adoption and orphanage system. Otherwise we're creating a new generation of impoverished and underprivileged who will be less educated and less safe, and more likely to have unplanned pregnancies. 

I'm perpetually uncomfortable with my stance on abortion, since i feel like there's simply no right answer in the current socio-political climate. 

Death penalty is another mess for me, since I'm in favor of the death penalty in general (the most serious crimes should have the most serious consequences), but the judicial system is such a mess that we shouldn't be executing anyone right now. It's another problem that isn't a simple ""Yes-No"", but needs to be tackled from many different directions. My ""moderate"" position: greater welfare, reformed sentencing, and re-regulation (de-privatization) appeals to the left, but I want reform so we can keep the death penalty, which is a lot more controversial in the left.",1,1,1444712323,1444717432

cvxpl4v,0,t1_cvxn7t7,DeShawnThordason,"HuffPo is a pretty useless source, they don't even link the study they're citing (and probably misrepresenting, given the pop-media's track record with science). Anyways, higher rates (per what? Woman? Pregnancy? Live Birth?) can be logically explained by poorer access to contraceptive birth control, poorer reproductive education, and in many cases, worse freedoms and protections for women. Again, *how much* of the difference can be explained through those means is unknowable. Simple correlation should not be taken to be causation, especially when there's reasonable explanations for the correlation.

My point is it's *a priori* reasonable to believe that, ceteris paribus (that is with ALL OTHER factors held equal -- access to other contraceptives, sex education, women's rights, etc), disincentivizing abortions (by making it illegal and consequently less safe) would lead to a decrease in the number of procedures. The risk (inherent costs) of abortion would go up, and a number of people would opt to carry to term. 

So, NO, it's *certainly* not proven to be the case that the opposite is true, based on the evidence that you've made available. Don't forget your confounding factors, because you hit the nail on the head with:

>My guess as to why this is would be that places abortion is illegal also tend to be more restrictive when it comes to sex ed and birth control

Remember, I'm talking about making abortion illegal, not restricting other forms of birth control, or limiting sex ed. 

As to your next point, I'm going to begin by pointing out that these are edge cases, and as such apply as exceptions, and not rules, even in the best of circumstances. 

Ideally, you would want to argue the certainty of your rules: i.e. that fetuses aren't persons and don't have rights and ergo abortion is a violation of a woman's privacy in all cases, although exceptions apply. 

Instead, you're not attacking the rule I'm proposing, but offering exceptions. And I'll deal with them like this: 

(Remember, I mentioned it before, and I'll reiterate, this is all from the perspective that fetuses are persons with rights. That's the perspective I'm arguing from. You can certainly disagree with that, and then you'd be attacking me at my ""rule"". If we allow that assumption, then all of these arguments have traction, otherwise, we're arguing personhood. And lord knows the answer to that one)

If a woman is raped, it's absolutely awful. And it's completely not her choice. But choosing to kill her fetus still is her choice. It's still an evil or unjust act, and it doesn't create justice, it's not bringing her rapist to justice. I think she would easily have legitimate grounds to put the child up for adoption. As an aside, I do not think the state should be able to force a woman to raise her child (although if she has the means she should contribute to his support, although that's one hell of an edge case). tl;dr of this is two wrongs don't make a right.

I've never understood the ""if the pregnancy may kill her"" argument. I suppose some hard-line pro-lifers think there's no instance where the mother's life should take precedent over the child's, but I disagree, and I think most people tend to as well. I think it's pretty clear, from a medical ethics standpoint, that doctors should do what they can or need to do to save the life of their patient the mother. The death of the child would be unfortunate, but medically unavoidable. In the grey area, the cases where the child might be saved or the mother is at risk but is not guaranteed serious harm, then I think it's up to the doctor's professional discretion. With modern medicine, there are almost no cases where the mother must die, and given her better odds of survival in nearly every situation, her life should be given priority when necessary.

> Even if the fetus would survive, I personally have to think it'd be really rough growing up without a mother

Living without a mother is bad. Being put up for adoption, or being bounced through foster care can be really hard on someone. But I, since I don't believe in reincarnation or after-lives, place a very high value on life. There is nothing more precious than life. All things that one can value, can only be realized through someone living. As such, I don't see any positive from someone choosing for another person whether she lives or dies. You're not saving them from anything but their own life. I would be *really* upset if someone were to tell me tomorrow that they thought my life wasn't worth living according to their values, and they have decided to help me out by killing me. tl;dr of this is yes living can suck but not living definitely sucks.",1,1,1444703403,1444717432

cvx8w8u,0,t1_cvx7p97,DeShawnThordason,"I am willing to accept that life begins at conception, and that many pregnancies fail naturally after this point, I think, doesn't invalidate that. After all, most lives fail, naturally, more or less on their own. That doesn't invalidate that they were once alive.

The point you're looking for, the Supreme Court calls ""personhood"", as I recall, as the point where someone becomes a person, and acquires his rights. At this point the government holds some responsibility in protecting those rights, and therefore, if I recall Roe v. Wade correctly, IF there's a consensus for when ""personhood"" begins, then it's necessary that abortion be illegal after that point (as it would be murder). The SC, at the time of Roe v. Wade, declined to place a personhood line, and clarified that the ruling wasn't meant to imply one. 

I've taken up arguing, for fun and practice, that personhood begins when one gains a sense of self and other on one's consciousness. This would place personhood somewhere between 2 and 3 years after birth, which could have some strange implications.",7,0,1444677895,1444717432
cvx8fsg,0,t1_cvx2lza,DeShawnThordason,"I think it's fairly reasonable to assume that making abortion illegal (and consequently less safe) would decrease the number of abortions. It certainty wouldn't stop all of them, though.

Arguably, an increase in unsafe abortions would lead to the deaths of more women, another reasonable assumption, although of course this wouldn't be all women who undergo the procedure.

Quantities of lives saved in each  category are basically wild speculation, so from the (traditionally ""conservative"") viewpoint that fetuses are lives that have rights, it's unclear which situation saves the most lives.

However, I suspect that the important distinction is that women who have abortions usually make that choice themselves (as they ought -- but important decisions are never fully removed from external pressures, coercions, or considerations), but the fetus has no such choice. Ultimately, it is more just for the women to die because they chose to take the risks that killed them, at least to an extent much greater than the fetuses do.

I imagine both sides would agree that in a perfect world there would be no abortions, for there would be no perceived need.",3,0,1444677235,1444717432
