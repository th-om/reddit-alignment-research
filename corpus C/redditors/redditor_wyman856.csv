cvq301r,0,t1_cvq1v67,wyman856,"This may just be personal bias, but I'm fairly certain that's just lip service because the LP for the foreseeable future will only nominate candidates who want to abolish or audit the Fed.

I mean, his chief economic advisor was Harvard's Jeffrey Miron (MIT PhD). He may have less faith in the Fed than the median person here, but I don't think he genuinely wants to have it audited (or at least not after learning the costs of such an action). Miron's against auditing the Fed btw.

I think it's telling that all of Johnson's campaign was focused on social/fiscal issues, with literally zero emphasis on the Fed.

cvpop91,0,t1_cvpla9r,wyman856,"To be fair, even libertarians think the LP is a joke. I met my state's LP  head (who shared a name with a certain famous hockey coach) and wow, he was a total clown. Clearly he didn't know what he was talking about and he may have literally gave the most boring presentation I've ever heard in my life.

It's a shame Gary Johnson is wasted running on the LP's ticket.

FWIW, I usually self-identify as a liberal before a libertarian. In my experience, libertarian has too much of a negative connotation and people automatically assume you are a Paulite and/or Randroid. Libertarians in general also like to focus too much on subjects the public finds little appeal in imo. 

I have found I can usually make more secret converts under the liberal label.

cvpnvpw,1,t3_3nn4mw,wyman856,"How many people have listened to Conversations With Tyler? I'm obviously biased, but it has become far and away my favorite non-comedy podcast. His guests are incredible (even though there has only been four so far) and I've listened to all but Rodrik's, which just came out, twice. I think [Luigi Zingales's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLS8aEHTqDvpInY9kslUOOK8Qj_-B91o_W&v=e7DU5f0GZ9E) interview was my favorite, but they're all amazing listens imo.

In terms of comedy podcasts, Superego's Forgotten Classics was a well needed break from my life's insanity that was hurting me with laughter. The premise is a group of hilarious improvisors are given the cast and title of a classic work of literature. Beyond that, the only other information they receive are the first and final sentences of the story. There's only 2 full episodes out so far, but both are amazing listens.

On a sadder note, between university and two part-time jobs, it seems like all of my badeconomics time has been stripped away. Damn the real world.

cve4ypa,0,t1_cve4roe,wyman856,"As the person who wrote that, I'm pretty indifferent to higher or lower marginal tax rates, as long as we're not talking at extreme highs or lows. What's the much bigger danger in my view is government spending at the federal level, which at current rates is unsustainable. I generally prefer lower taxes overall, but I wouldn't mind modest tax increases if they were met with a proposal of limiting government spending (for example, increasing tax rates 5-10% if the government agrees to limit its spending to increases of only 1-2% for a presidential term or so).
