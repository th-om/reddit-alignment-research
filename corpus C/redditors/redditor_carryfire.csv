I would not feel comfortable with the president disregarding overwhelming evidence on something more life threatening. ",8,0,1444357382,1444720269

cvmwalx,0,t1_cvmw1ay,carryfire,"I appreciate that people like you exist.  I understand that a functioning society needs to have those who concerned with liberty alongside of those who care about security.  I just find the 2nd amendment to be pointless.

I don't see how you could feel that the average person does not have more rights than they did in 1789.  Non-landowners can vote. Women can vote. Black people can vote. People can't be slaves.  Gay people can get married.  People can't be discriminated against generally. Plus, we have so many new ways to care for people if they are hurt, sick, unemployed, some shit happened, whatever...

I like living now and if there were no guns, I think it would be even better. Just my opinion.  ",1,0,1443893000,1444720269
cvmvhmj,0,t1_cvmva54,carryfire,"Hmm couldn't possibly disagree more in this particular scenario.  Not being able to own a gun is one ""right"" I'm happy to part with.  I would totally prefer not having mass shootings every 6 months.

Also, think of how many more rights the average American has now compared to when the Constitution was written. Seems like things are trending in the right direction.",1,0,1443891605,1444720269

More free? What the hell does that even mean?  If people don't have to worry about mass shootings the way an American might, then I consider that considerably more free.  They are more free to live a peaceful life.",2,0,1443890719,1444720269
