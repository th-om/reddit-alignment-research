In fact, by almost every economic and social metric, everything is the best it has ever been right now.


- Public education in the USA is the best it has ever been right now. It stayed about the same from 1900 to 1973 and has been continuously improving since 1973. By every measure, graduation rates, literacy rates, standardized test scores, advanced placement courses, extra-curricular participation, truancy, highest degree attained, etc., things are the best ever right now. http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/2014/tables.html
- Unemployment rates are close to average right now. In 1982, the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent. http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0104719.html Or 10.4% in 1983 http://www.multpl.com/unemployment/table
In 1979, interest rates were 17+%.
- USA life expectancy has been continuously improving http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN
- USA household income is almost as high as it has ever been right now, and if you take into account how many single parent households we have now compared to the past, the current situation is not bleak. http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Household-Income-Distribution.php Every quintile has improved, but the top 5% have improved faster than the rest. https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/",1,0,1443976751,1444727052

In 1989, the median household income was $51,681 in inflation adjusted dollars. In 2012 it was $51,017.

For the top 5%, in **inflation adjusted** dollars, the 1988 lower threshold of household income was $127,958. Today, you need to earn $166,200 to be in the top 5%.
