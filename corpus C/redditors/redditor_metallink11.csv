cvxeayf,0,t1_cvxbblr,metallink11,"Which is why deficit spending isn't as much of a problem as people make it out to be. The US government can borrow money at a lower rate than inflation, so deficit spending is just a roundabout way of taxing wealth. And even better, it's a tax on any wealth that's held in US dollars, so we're also able to ""tax"" people who aren't even US citizens. It's a pretty awesome trick and it's a shame that we're discouraged from utilizing it by people who like to imagine that the US budget works the same as their household budget.",3,0,1444685616,1444726232
cvwn6tt,0,t1_cvwmt8v,metallink11,"Wealth inequality would be a problem if the poor were getting poorer while the rich get richer, but that's not the case. Everyone is getting richer, but the rich get richer faster. In my opinion, that's just a sign that we should cut taxes for the poor and middle class while raising them on the rich instead of trying to slow everything down with more tariffs and trade barriers.",1,0,1444626674,1444726232
cvtrnm8,0,t1_cvtnol5,metallink11,"No, Putin just forced Obama's hand. There is no point in training rebels if Russia is just going to bomb them. We're not going to go to war with Russia over Assad, so if Putin wants to prop him up we may as well just cut our losses and go home. It's his problem now.",1,0,1444404313,1444726232
cvsq107,0,t1_cvskw5k,metallink11,"What we've heard about the TPP says that it's largely about standardizing those sort of things across the member countries. Considering that the US already has some of the strongest IP laws out of the member countries, it's pretty unlikely that the laws are going to get any stricter in the US. We won't know for sure until the text is released, but the IP components of the TPP are likely much more about making sure that countries like Malaysia can no longer get away with selling bootlegged copies of US movies in retail stores.",5,0,1444326774,1444726232

cvrd6dh,0,t1_cvrbmk7,metallink11,"Yup, all the problems with H1-B1 visas could be fixed if the worker was allowed to switch jobs after getting their visa. Then companies wouldn't be able to pay them shit wages and work them to death because they'll just pack up and go work for someone else. And then once companies can't get away with that shit anymore, they'll just hire American workers unless they legitimately can't find an American who can do the job.",53,0,1444232683,1444726232

While I don't agree with her ""kill all men"" comments (or similar comments by other bigots) I do believe being able to say stupid shit like that is a fundamental right that shouldn't be infringed by the government. Of course, other entities like her employer or twitter should be free to restrict her speech however they want.",31,0,1444167609,1444726232
