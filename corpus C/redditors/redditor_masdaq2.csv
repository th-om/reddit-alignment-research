cvqem87,0,t1_cvqdcyr,masdaq2,"Yeah, to me it should be Palmer. After that injury, he has come back and lead the Arizona offense, without much of a rushing attack. All AP did was abuse his kid and get suspended. Terrible f-ing descision. ",36,0,1444158388,1444727736
cvqehww,1,t3_3nqow5,masdaq2,Hilton. Colts still cannot run the ball. Even with luck out Hasselback tossed the ball 47 times. Thats a freaking backup! ,-1,0,1444158211,1444727736
cvp3idb,0,t1_cvp15gm,masdaq2,"Arizona will be higher, bad loss yesterday, but the defense is built to take on a passing league. Palmer has the receivers and the skill to lead a good offense, not to mention the fact they have the big play capabilities to stay in games. ",9,0,1444065775,1444727736

He is losing ground fast in New Hampshire, which was his strongest state. He is looking like a backup for the establishment, which has been sputtering of late. Expect him to drop out to make room for Bush. ",2,0,1442973194,1444727736
cvawnrw,0,t1_cvac7ku,masdaq2,"I doubt it, there is a massive portion of the GOP who view illegal immigration as a vital issue. Thus, they will never support a Bush or Rubio, so expect to see a Cruz or Carson up there with Bush or Rubio until the end. Bush has been terrible, so I think Bush falling into irrelevance is more likely than most think. Either way, this field will be competitive till the end. ",3,0,1442972992,1444727736
