cvvqkv2,0,t1_cvvmp5g,theholyroller,"But also remember that democrats, in many of the local races in which republicans won, actually received more votes. It literally boggles the mind to consider it, but in many states we saw races where Dems took in 3 or 4 percent more votes but lost an election. ",4,0,1444566174,1444721206
cvuqz9c,1,t3_3o5op0,theholyroller,"Whatever liberal or conservative bias may or may not exist out there, it cannot be refuted that right-wing candidates regularly make up the most absurd shit - straight up lies and unadulterated falsifications - and their supporters never, ever seem to call them on it, or to be at all interested in the truth in any meaningful way whatsoever. I cannot conceive of a moment when a Democratic candidate has repeatedly made a string of such ignorant and false  statements of the type Carson has been making the last few weeks only to end up being largely supported by the party.

cvtlbl5,1,t3_3o1l8j,theholyroller,Republicans obsess over abortion and then are happy to watch people die once they're out of the womb. Makes sense I guess. ,2,0,1444392164,1444721206
cvsl23t,0,t1_cvsk7iy,theholyroller,"Logically then it would be no more of a false talking point than to say the inverse, that Republicans are any better on the economy. And yet the main point I'm making is that there is scant evidence that republicans do more for the economy, while there is plenty of evidence in support of democrats being better for the economy, despite that evidence being debatable.

cvsjtik,0,t1_cvsj7f3,theholyroller,"yea i've heard that. but boy, that's a lot of consistent good luck. and the other takeaway is that if republicans actually were better than dems on the economy, or balancing the budget, or reducing the debt, we would see at least *some* evidence of that, but we just don't. so chalking it up to dumb luck for democrats does not make a compelling argument in support of republicans, by any stretch.

cvsj1uk,1,t3_3nxwl1,theholyroller,So....why do so many of them vote for Republicans? We have leading presidential contenders in the Republican party that think the earth is 6000 years old. I mean. What the fucking fuck. ,3,0,1444316512,1444721206
cvsiw98,0,t1_cvsgmvo,theholyroller,"just a quick find, and yeah yeah it's a biased source - but you can fact check the assertions, which are true despite the leanings of the publication. http://www.forwardprogressives.com/want-to-shut-a-republican-up-just-show-them-this/

and then there's the fact that the economy as a whole historically does better under democrats. http://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2012/10/10/want-a-better-economy-history-says-vote-democrat/",0,0,1444316263,1444721206
cvsdnrk,0,t1_cvsdbno,theholyroller,"I think Burt is saying that had Donald Trump done nothing at all with his money except put it into an index fund he would have more money than he does now. So all his 'business investments' that he claims makes him a good businessman are actually evidence of him performing worse than an index fund. I.e. Trump doesn't have anything to back up his big talk about being a particularly successful business man, beside shaving started on 3rd base with his dad's money. ",4,0,1444306022,1444721206
