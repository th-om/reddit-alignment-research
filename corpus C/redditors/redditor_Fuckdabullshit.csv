No, instead we force him to keep working and hand over a large portion of his paycheck. Also, there's no law that says a woman has to stay home to care for the child. If there was, you might have a point. ",3,0,1444694104,1444717906
cvxiroq,0,t1_cvxipvt,Fuckdabullshit,"Murder is part of our existence.... lists a bunch of things that aren't even remotely murder.

It's no wonder pro-life and pro-choice people talk straight past each other. I'm convinced at this point that a good portion on each side aren't even interested in understanding the other viewpoint. 

It's all about demonizing the other side at this point, which is evident from the comments in this post. ",6,0,1444692728,1444717906

Go help a few other people out and you'll get your help. If you can't take the time to give advice to a few people, don't be surprised when no one has time to give advice to you. ",4,0,1444692626,1444717906
