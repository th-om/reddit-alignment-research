cvwlm2m,0,t1_cvwiyt7,DaSuHouse,"> How do you democratize something while simultaneously making it more exclusionary?

I'm not sure why you're stuck on the notion that making college free equates to paying everyone to go to college. One example of how this might work is to limit subsidized tuitions to a limited number of seats for accredited institutions (i.e., exclude for-profit schools).

> If the problem were that there is an underclass of brilliant, capable individuals who just can't get in, that would be different.

This certainly addresses the problem with the financially challenged being unable to afford a level of education that has become more of a requirement to get a decent job. Instead of having an education system tied to student debt and biased towards those with the funds for it, we could have higher education be truly meritocratic.

> A better solution, in my mind, would be to actually educate people at the secondary level.

This doesn't solve every problem and should be treated as a start to solving them. Improving primary and secondary education, limiting access to student loans, and incentivizing enrollment into professional trade schools are some other initiatives that might make sense to address the other problems you've mentioned.",1,0,1444622940,1444732210
