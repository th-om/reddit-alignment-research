Despite what the employee handbook says, there's no law about not being a douche boss, and nothing prevents them from filling him in.

Your best bet is to find a new job where they respect their employees, and possible to move to a state with more employee protections (TN is not one of them).",1,0,1444714075,1444718674

I lived with a car salesman for three months, he used to brag about pulling shit like this.

I agree that the GF needs to learn how to deal with this, but all the people who claim she's lying?  Car dealers PREY on young women who don't know anything about buying cars (They prey on young men too, but they tend to be more successful with women, since less women take a strong interest in buying cars earlier in life).

Hell, I'm a 41 year old guy who has purchased 5-6 cars, new and used, and I am still surprised by some of the bullshit they try and pull- and how I almost fell for it.

Sounds to me like they pulled a big con on her.  It's possible that she signed for the new car under duress, believing that they weren't going to return the car.  Na√Øve, yes.  Not sure if she will be able to back out legally.  But at the very least the dealer should be exposed to the public.",3,0,1444713048,1444718674

If you knew you would have to pay a $30M tax bill on $100M or you could buy a $100M asset and generate more income or just hold it until a more favorable time, what would you do?
