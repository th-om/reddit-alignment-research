cvxhdil,0,t1_cvx6fka,DoctorDrakin,Which is why the corporations divide you into two groups and make the rest completely apathetic. Divide and conquer. How can you rise up against your masters if the slaves can't even work together or agree on things. ,8,0,1444690463,1444719453
cvxh02a,0,t1_cvwz8lz,DoctorDrakin,"Obviously no one country is the best at everything. If your measure of best is land size then its Russia, if its biggest armed forces its the US, if its best national hockey team then its Canada. A lot of experts like to choose liveability meaning the best place in the world for the average citizen to live or some measure similar to that. I personally think this is a good judge of greatest. 

In this case the US usually ends up ranked somewhere between 10 to 25 which is still very good. Also no one single country occupies the top spot for very long but you can see from multiple years and multiple studies which countries are consistently up there in the top 10 or 5. 

These were some of the countries I listed above. Currently the city of Melbourne, Australia is widely considered to be the most liveable city in the world while Denmark or Switzerland probably holds the top spot out of the countries. ",1,0,1444689858,1444719453
cvwxnhr,0,t1_cvwtgmp,DoctorDrakin,"The US has some good things going for it sure but its really fallen down in many areas for the average citizen. Sure if you are pretty wealthy then you can get the best of the best of nearly anything in America but for the average citizen there are many other places in the world that consistently rank higher such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore and a decent number of European countries like Switzerland, Sweden etc. This is due to better healthcare and outcomes, higher safety, lower crime, high median incomes, high life expectancy, cleaner environments, higher educational opportunities and standards, good government and even freedom where the US has fallen down a fair bit and many other factors.

cvwhs9z,0,t1_cvwfm2y,DoctorDrakin,Bush pissed of the world/allies much than Obama has. Obama's a very popular guy outside of the US actually and the allies are ok with his foreign policy. No one wants a war with Iran and people were happy to cut a deal but admittedly shit like this from Iran is not smart from them. ,13,0,1444615858,1444719453

cvwhewp,0,t1_cvwg5lk,DoctorDrakin,The GG was Harper's guy and as PM he had the powers to ask the GG for an election. After the vote of no-confidence to hold Cabinet in contempt Harper was still the PM and still the head of government. He still had the right to ask the GG for an election as the other parties had failed to yet rally behind a leader and form an alternative government and get sworn in. Thus they went to an election which is really a pretty sensible thing to do anyway and Harper won thanks to the voting system splitting the opposition votes.  ,0,0,1444615217,1444719453
cvwelxp,0,t1_cvwcm0z,DoctorDrakin,You are wrong. The GG is effectively appointed by PM through the Queen so the GG is basically Harper's guy. This is so Canada remains its own country and the Queen can still stay really neutral in times of minor crisis like these.  The Queen did not interfere at all. Also in that case the GG still followed protocol as far as I am aware.,3,0,1444610164,1444719453
cvvipal,0,t1_cvvhtjg,DoctorDrakin,This is silly. There is no more burden on other Californians than before it just makes things easier for a huge section of the population. As for internet voting its never going to happen and it shouldn't happen. It's just too insanely risky.,12,0,1444537576,1444719453

cvu9d3o,0,t1_cvtxsb0,DoctorDrakin,Exactly. The local German population were mostly behind the Nazi's by that point. They had seen an economic recovery and had been spun the story that Jews were the root of all problems. There was nowhere to hide.,2,0,1444431867,1444719453
