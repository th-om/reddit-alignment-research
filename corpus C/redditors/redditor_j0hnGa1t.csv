practical

ˈpraktɪk(ə)l

adjective

1. of or concerned with the actual doing or use of something rather than with theory and ideas.

[Ayn Rand](http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/library/pwni.html): ""Formally, I call it Objectivism, but informally I call it **a philosophy for living on earth**.""

[The Objective Standard - What is Objectivism](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/what-is-objectivism/):
The Nature of Reality

Objectivism holds that reality is an absolute—that facts are facts, regardless of anyone’s hopes, fears, or desires. There is a world independent of our minds to which our thinking must correspond if our ideas are to be true and therefore of **practical use** in living our lives, pursuing our values, and protecting our rights.

[Ayn Rand's non-fiction at the Ayn Rand Institute](http://campus.aynrand.org/more/ayn-rands-non-fiction/): ""Ayn Rand’s lifelong passion for philosophy was rooted in her conviction that **philosophy is the most practical force in human life**.""

[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Ayn Rand](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayn-rand/): ""Rand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and achievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a good human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life. Philosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative abstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is. Everyone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at least an implicit one (1982a, ch. 1). Her novels express her belief that if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more or less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our lives will be disastrous. **Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical importance**.""
