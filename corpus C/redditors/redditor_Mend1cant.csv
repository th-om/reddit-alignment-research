cvvdq9b,1,t3_3o7n17,Mend1cant,"I loved that in middle school I took a laptop class, but it entirely centered on taking cornell notes on microsoft word. Not once were we taught ways to actually make use of computing, and were discouraged from using them other than when instructed to. The problems we face I believe aren't in high schools or universities but rather primary education.",0,0,1444528026,1444721043
cvvd4r2,1,t3_3o8rzo,Mend1cant,"It has little to do with religion for me. Hell, most of Leviticus which everyone cites is more or less an ancient health brochure, and I could care less what it says. I see it as an ethical dilemma regarding the definition of human life. 

As for my own opinion regarding abortion, I detest the argument people make saying that its a woman's right to choose what to do with her body. An unborn child is not someone's body. Perhaps early on you can consider it not much more than a mass of cells, but once that takes shape, intentionally killing that child is to me almost the equivalent of murder. To end the life of a child before it is born simply because it inconveniences you is selfish and inhuman.

I am an ardent advocate for teaching people about birth control and  making it available as anything from the pill to condoms. On that note, I also believe in abstinence as its own birth control. Simply put, if you don't want pregnancies or STIs, don't have sex. I won't force that on anyone, but I also believe in personal responsibility that if you made a stupid choice you should live with it. Put your child up for adoption if you must, but give it a shot at life. 

If it's a case of rape or harm to the mother, then I understand. Rape can be dealt with early on in a pregnancy if reported (I could go on about my vision of a society in which women would be much more willing to report it, but I won't). And I wouldn't ever ask a mother to die in pregnancy if it can't be prevented. To me, that's something out of her control and isn't so much an ethical issue in my eyes.",1,0,1444526926,1444721043

cvojmq1,0,t1_cvohsyr,Mend1cant,"Not true. All of it actually. Have you ever seen a Rite-Aid or a Walgreens? A 16 year old can walk in and out of there with a pack of condoms. It may not be medical birth control, but contraceptives aren't some hoarded commodity. 

Edit: Hell, damn near half the girls I knew in High School a few years back were on some form of birth control. Even the ones not having sex, it's just a precautionary measure that is becoming more commonly used in younger society",4,0,1444014492,1444721043
cvojjbd,0,t1_cvoj79f,Mend1cant,"If you reach the point with your spouse that you no longer trust them with your medical information, you probably shouldn't be married to them any longer.
