cvqk4es,1,t3_3nqzw7,Zeakk1,"It really depends on what and who you're hiring and who you're accountable to.

Some skill sets simply exist without necessarily having a college degree. Some soft skills are hard to measure and a degree, graduate or otherwise, is a hint at a minimum level of ability.

I work for a state agency that recently added a 4 year degree to their minimum requirements. The difference between these folks in their 50s that only went to high school and these folks in their 20s with college degrees is amazing.

Another consideration is how much is invested into human capital development.

cvijol5,0,t1_cvi3eku,Zeakk1,"You're right. There's really not -- but I do think the cut off needs to be somewhere. I might have higher standards than others, but the cut off should ether be 5.5"" or lower. In my prime I was 305 lbs and would consistently have a 5.0 or 5.1 40 -- however in the same regard few people believed me when I told them how much I weighed.

I am not a coach and haven't touched a football for years. The mile time is arbitrary, but it's an expression of overall fitness. A mile isn't that far, and 7 mph isn't that fast. I just expect a player, and more importantly a student athlete that practices 5+ times a week to be in some kind of cardiovascular shape. If they can't jog a mile in a decent time, that tells me a lot about what they're doing with their practice time.

There are a lot of other factors that go into making it on this list besides arbitrary fitness times, but the high school player that needs to be developed probably isn't going to have many of them; http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/2/20/8079187/2015-nfl-combine-results-40-yard-dash-offensive-line 

I do know this -- if the kid weighs over 400 lbs, I am going to expect him to have lifting stats that reflect that. If he can't move and isn't also ridiculously strong, I wouldn't take on the risk. However, there is some D3 school or community college that will pick him up if no one else don't

If this kid had a 9 minute mile time and could run a 40 in 5 flat or less, it'd be a different story and he'd be a different weight. ",25,0,1443536105,1444732194

Especially since it kind of ignores all of the dictators and kings that the U.S. has sponsored over the years in the name of democracy.

I just don't think he really thought about this statement before making it.  ",11,0,1443534747,1444732194

cvhnzvd,0,t1_cvhlc3y,Zeakk1,"I think you're confusing the concept of diminishing returns with the Laffer curve. The Laffer curve presumes that at 100% tax that the revenue becomes zero. 

Folks who have actually tried to apply real data to the Laffer curve have put the revenue maximizing tax rate at 70%. 

Now the trick with tax policy is it's a lot more complicated than the options that you're presenting, especially when there is progressive income tax rate. What the rate is set at is not necessarily the effective tax rate that people pay. 

There are all sorts of things that folks can do to exclude income from taxation that lower their effective tax rate, and in addition to those subtractions we also allow deductions, exemptions, and credits. 

So, the higher the tax rate the less likely a person wants to pay those taxes and so they'll engage in activities that reduce their tax burden. So, a business owner might actually invest in their business because it would reduce the amount of profit they pay in taxes. They might be more likely to pay higher wages, and so forth.

Most importantly, someone might decide to control less of a market share because the taxes make it not worth the effort making room for more firms to compete with them.

Taxes and economic tax policy is actually a very complicated realm and you're trying to reduce it down to a 99% or 50% taxes because you think your logical fallacy proves some kind of point. ",2,0,1443494175,1444732194
