cvw67zn,0,t1_cvw5nhq,milesandmilesoftacos,"Do you know what it actually would look like on the Democratic side?

Bernie Sanders.

And I say this is a conservative, but y'all obviously have the much more respectable anti-establishment candidate on your side. But it's all out of the same thread, Americans on both sides are getting sick of Washington insiders. ",7,0,1444595682,1444717996
cvw5ogq,1,t3_3od8n7,milesandmilesoftacos,"Just because Bernie has held office for decades doesn't make him a political insider. He is still very much an outsider to the establishment and Democratic Party. There's a reason he's had next to no endorsements from the party he is seeking the nomination from. 

The sudden rush of anti-establishment*ism* to the mainstream is very interesting in my opinion. I think the modern movement away from establishment politics has existed longer among conservatives (Tea Party) than it has for liberals, but I'd say today it's pretty obvious that no matter who you talk to, far right or far left, they are sick of business as usual in Washington.",21,0,1444594875,1444717996

If you've ever met someone in the military, you'd know they are more pro-Liberty, pro-2nd amendment than most gun-toting Americans. They wouldn't take illegal orders. They'd be on the side of civilians. ",3,0,1444515658,1444717996
