cvxrafw,1,t3_3oj18x,MpMerv,"Yes, it sounds like you two will eventually end up together after you find a way to close the distance. As a matter of fact, your scenario is very similar to mine. My boyfriend of this past summer 2015 went away to another country and we've been talking less and less but I know that we both mutually value each other very much.

But I'd still advise you not to lose him. ",4,0,1444706141,1444726846

I lived in Brooklyn, far enough from Manhattan not to see anything in person, but I'll never forget, as soon as I stepped outside of my school, seeing the ENORMOUS black plume of smoke clear across the blue sky. That alone left an impression on me because up until then, I didn't grasp the scale even though I had heard of the two plane crashes. ",1,0,1444621520,1444726846
