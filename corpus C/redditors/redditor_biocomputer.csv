For example the body might have been 4 cells big at the time and those 4 cells gave rise to all subsequent cells in each quadrant.,4,0,1444676929,1444724187
cvwnhky,1,t3_3odqpw,biocomputer,"If you're talking about a naturally occurring phenomenon then yes, it's called [parthenogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis) but it only occurs in a few species.

If you're talking about what's technically possible in the lab then there are more options.  For example, you could [make sperm and egg from the same person](http://www.nature.com/news/rudimentary-egg-and-sperm-cells-made-from-stem-cells-1.16636) then fertilize the egg with the sperm and the offspring will have all its DNA from one parent.",2,0,1444627450,1444724187

cvwmm8e,1,t3_3odogu,biocomputer,"It's not really true that the female would not express the recessive trait.  If a female is heterozygous for an X-linked recessive mutation and their X-inactivation is random, then half their cells will express the mutated form of the gene and half will express the normal form.  The reason they may not display the overall phenotype or symptoms of the particular mutation/disease is because sometimes the half of her cells that are ""good"" can make up for the half that are mutated.  For example, in [haemophilia A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia_A) (caused by a mutation on the X chromosome) you'll generally be fine with half as much factor VIII being produced but a carrier female could have mild symptoms.  So at the genetic level they express the recessive gene in 50% of their cells as would be expected, but at the organismal level they may appear normal.

Another reason a female carrier could appear normal is because X-inactivation isn't always random, especially in cases of X-linked mutations.  [Skewed X-inactivation is common when a female carries a mutation for an X-linked mental retardation syndrome gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC384975/) and [if this skewing doesn't occur then the female can exhibit (a milder form of) the syndrome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16100724).",6,0,1444625250,1444724187

cvvczo8,1,t3_3o6xdd,biocomputer,"I've done some research with the gene in question so I can give a little background.

[The gene *H3F3B* encodes the histone protein H3.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H3F3B_%28gene%29).  Histones are like little spools around which DNA is wound, they enable all your DNA (about 3 meters long if stretched out) to be compacted and fit into a single cell.  Histones also affect accessibility of DNA by winding it tighter or looser; DNA needs to be accessible for a gene in a given region to be expressed.  Therefore histones play a major role in regulating pretty much every gene in the genome.

There are 4 core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, and some of these have variants.  H3.3 is a variant of H3.  There are 2 identical copies of the gene that encodes the H3.3 protein, *H3F3A* and *H3F3B*, so you might think that if one is mutated the other can compensate, however as is case with the OPs daughter, that isn't how it works.  [Here's a study in mice where they deleted either *H3F3A* or *H3F3B* to see what the effects would be](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004964), they found some redundancy and that in general *H3F3B* was more important (keep in mind that this study in mice won't translate perfectly to humans and human genes).

OP I don't know where you're located but one of the [top researchers in the world who studies H3.3 is located in New York](http://www.rockefeller.edu/research/faculty/labheads/DavidAllis/), maybe you could contact them.",3,0,1444526669,1444724187
