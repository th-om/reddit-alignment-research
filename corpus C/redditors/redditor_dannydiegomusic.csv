cvxjw9f,0,t1_cvxjjo0,dannydiegomusic,"Oh man, I totally forgot that passage. It seems to suggest that Jon will stay dead for at least a while before coming back. I feel like Arya and Jon have thought about each other too many times for them not to get a reunion in the end. Also “Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle. Who knows?” From Jon II in AGOT",1,0,1444694587,1444717960
cvxjh8p,0,t1_cvxj739,dannydiegomusic,Oh I just meant Maggy's prophecy where Cersei's kids have to die before she does. I guess by soon I mean before the end of the series which is just 2 more books :(. Just as speculation though I think the show accelerating killing off Myrcella means that Tommen could go at any moment (and given all the crap that's going down in King's Landing it really could happen any time).,1,0,1444693897,1444717960
cvxj47g,0,t1_cvxj1cd,dannydiegomusic,That scene where Tommen fights the straw man in a tourney is so great. I really hate knowing that Tommen's going to die soon.,1,0,1444693309,1444717960
cvxj0je,0,t1_cvxitc6,dannydiegomusic,Haha definitely lol'ed at the end. Bobby B at 74 and Greatjon at 47 though? So disrespectful...,1,0,1444693134,1444717960
cvxix5t,0,t1_cvxisn3,dannydiegomusic,"See I read this completely differently, Qyburn seems way more like a mad scientist to me than someone who would know how to use magic (blood or otherwise). It would make me so sad if Jon came back as a total dick like LSH though, a Jon-Arya reunion is the closest thing to a happy ending that I can hope for in this series.",1,0,1444692977,1444717960

cvxilfq,0,t1_cvxi9pm,dannydiegomusic,I wish they showed the wolves more often in the show. Having a loyal personal direwolf is way better than 3 dragons that don't listen to you IMO.,3,0,1444692449,1444717960

cvxi7nk,1,t3_3oiio8,dannydiegomusic,Zach Lowe wrote a piece a few years ago saying [Adam Silver wanted to at least discuss having a 40 minute game](http://grantland.com/features/the-case-40-minute-nba-game/). This would be a much much much bigger change than any of the current under 2 minute mark rules like no Hack-a-shaq.,2,0,1444691830,1444717960
cvxi2qg,0,t1_cvxi050,dannydiegomusic,"I don't understand why if Qyburn is good enough to not only bring Gregor back from the dead but also to enhance him, he can't just sew Jaime's hand back on (or even just give him someone else's!). It frustrates me as a big Jaime fan that Qyburn is now suddenly this superhuman surgeon.",1,0,1444691608,1444717960
