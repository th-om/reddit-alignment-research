cvxmh02,1,t3_3ohja1,EricGMW,"I was convinced, after seeing Matt dropped the hand signal routine, but noticing that his total ended in 11, that he was going to start finessing his Final Jeopardy wager to always increase his total by whatever and one dollar... But alas, it was not to be.",2,0,1444698604,1444727105
cvwhyeo,0,t1_cvw1pep,EricGMW,"I think that the most recent example of a Governor General going against the wishes of the House of Commons would be the King-Byng affair, where William Lyon MacKenzie King requested that Byng dissolve Parliament and call another general election, and Byng refused to do so.  To be fair, there was quite a bit of scandal and politicking involved prior to the request, but it happened.",3,0,1444616161,1444727105

Had to be familiar with every molecule in the process, their structures, every enzyme, every byproduct, everything going in and everything going out.

cvurba2,1,t3_3o6lnl,EricGMW,"From the moment I walked in, to the moment I left, I heard non-stop complaining and under-the-breath profanities. And it was only about twenty minutes for me from entering to leaving. There was even one person, who was next in line (out of maybe about seven), who felt it was necessary to loudly ask if it would be better to come back tomorrow since the person in front was taking so long. I mean come on, people. Voting isn't a chore to bear. Just be patient and do your civic duty! Please don't leave the line.

And my God, it took so much will power on my part to just keep holding my tongue during that wait as those behind me kept going on and on and on...",2,0,1444484951,1444727105

Edit: Did I get that right? What would have happened if he lost everything in FJ, but got to it himself? Does he win because he outlast the others, or does he also lose the game?",7,0,1444482562,1444727105
