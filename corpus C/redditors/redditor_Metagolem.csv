cvxwu8o,0,t1_cvxlzta,Metagolem,"Kind of. I'd like to think to some extent two-year olds are incapable of having a 
moral compass and actually do have unstable emotions rather than being calculatingly abusive while hiding behind the veneer of emotion.",1,0,1444719435,1444726940
cvxwsx8,0,t1_cvxtfxa,Metagolem,"I actually do think you could call it ""social activism""... It's just regressive social activism that attempts to stall progress rather than promote it.",2,0,1444719308,1444726940
cvx7g6g,1,t3_3og2ye,Metagolem,"The title is actually true. It's why abusive relationships are a thing. Abusers benefit from their abusive behavior and that's why they continue it.

A pretty good example paraphrased from ""Why Does He Do That?"" by Lundy Bancroft: Say a family with a male abuser has an equitable split on the chore of washing dishes. One day, the abuser comes in, while in a mood, has dinner, and then doesn't wash the dishes. When someone comes to remind him that it's his turn to do dishes, he responds by blowing up and throwing plates and a general shit fit. From then on he can pretty much shirk his dish washing duties because everyone will remember the last time and work around him.",8,0,1444675800,1444726940
cvw680k,0,t1_cvvlx42,Metagolem,">fox (slang for, you guessed it, a slut)

My impression is it's a little more nuanced than that, it's more like a predatory slut or man-eater. Still a gendered slur, though.",1,0,1444595683,1444726940

cvvm9sj,1,t3_3oat4m,Metagolem,"Artesia: The Known World

While relatively unknown in the general community, I've run into quite a few people that own it and think it's quite neat. Never met anyone that's actually played it.

Character creation is set up to be mostly random and leans very heavily on medieval ideas like bloodlines and following your parent occupations. During play there's like 13 different kinds of XP you gain from doing different things. There is a ""binding"" system that essentially gives in game mechanics for emotions that players can manipulate by use of gifts.",3,0,1444547610,1444726940

tl;dr: Standard Priority's worst case is 624.5 karma and best case is 1030 karma. Sum to 10s worst case is pretty much the same, but best case is 1075 karma.

Just in terms of karma it's pretty balanced.",6,0,1444528988,1444726940
