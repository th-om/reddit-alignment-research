cu5c3ru,1,t3_3h7hoq,AdmiralChamrajnagar,"Around 4 years ago (I'm in my mid twenties) I was a blissfully ignorant college student with little to no idea of what the world around me was like. A friend of mine of Palestinian descent introduced me to Al Jazeera before AJUS was even a thing, and I started viewing the world as something that doesn't revolve around the United States. Once I had that little bit of spark, it grew into a flame I couldn't extinguish and had to learn more; about World Politics, about the shortcomings of our state and federal branches, about local biases, etc. The more I learned, the more depressed I became, as the world is truly a fucked up place. Fast forward to last year, my depression was full rage, and I had to reconcile with myself that the current state of things was out of my control for the most part, and the best thing I can do is focus on improving myself and helping others become more aware. My generation, for the most part, is disillusioned with our political system and thinks we're already doomed politically, at least according to about 90% of every non-poli-sci majors. I've been trying to help people realize that voting, especially in primaries DOES matter, at the very least to show those ""above"" us what ideas matter to you.

Today, however, I have one singular focus that I've decided to dedicate my time to: a military base on our one natural orbiting satellite (the moon). I think that if humanity ever wants to reach the stars, we need somewhere to build large ships capable of travel, and large ships built within the confines of Earth are improbably because of our gravitational pull. Now, I know this is something that many people would consider impossible in our current world, but I firmly believe that if we can conjure a crisis extra-terrestrially, perhaps we can gather enough support world-wide (think Ender's Game, but instead of aliens, there's an asteroid 50 years away going to collide directly with earth) to begin a base on the moon that has the capability to launch missiles away from earth. If this idea can garnish support from all the major industrialized countries, and have a doctrine of being a location not controlled by any one country, but as a coalition of Earth specifically for extra-terrestrial defense. I think it's possible to start small like that, with one focus beyond just Earth, and eventually, as it progresses, become our major station for building spaceships, and then become our trading post once other colonies are created. This thought is what drives me today, and keeps my depression at bay because I think it's an absolutely achievable goal, and something I can work toward with my life. Even if I can't achieve my ultimate goal, I hope to at least lay the ground work so others can pick up the mantle and we can begin looking beyond our small, dying rock, to other small, dying rocks.

tl;dr I'm still depressed, but found something I personally can work toward that would make things better for humanity as a whole on the form of a space station built on the Moon.",1,0,1439768314,1444732214

Take it in stride, accept he's bred from a different type of cloth, and move on to something productive. A good indicator of a person you ought to consider the viewpoints of (at least here) is someone who cites sources, does not straw-man arguments, and backs up claims with arguments not based in fantasy or lack of knowledge. Nothing to contribute beyond that, which makes me the same sort of poster, but it's what I came to say.",0,0,1439720317,1444732214

Unfortunately I'm not adding much to the discussion besides parroting what you've said in regards to your stances on Paul/Sanders. Also would like to throw in that I'm incredibly sorry you are seeing Wisconsin at this time in history. We used to be better. Perhaps one day we will be again, but we'd need competent leadership.",1,0,1433866535,1444732214
