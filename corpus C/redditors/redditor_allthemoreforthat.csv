That's what I did, I met some really cool people in a French meetup and we meet weekly either to speak French or just to hang out. Or you can just go to downtown Vancouver on the weekends, there are a couple of really cool clubs on Main St, you can just go there to dance/have a beer, you'll meet some fun people that way.
