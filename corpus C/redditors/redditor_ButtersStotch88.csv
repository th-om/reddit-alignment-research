All the people in this thread seem to be overlooking the fact that most of the things we benefit from in the modern world are a product of capitalist economies. Hell, Reddit was started by a citizen of a capitalist economy. It might not be perfect, and can always be improved, but capitalism will ALWAYS beat out socialism and communism.",4,0,1444357070,1444726136

cvlqbr6,1,t3_3n7a0t,ButtersStotch88,"As a right leaner, here's what I think should happen:

1. Assault rifles need to be banned
2. Gun show loopholes need to be closed
3. Better background checks

But here's the problem guys: Even if we did all the above, mass shootings like Oregon will still happen. He killed people with some pistols and a rifle. If the laws above were in place, some crazy dude without a criminal record can still waltz in to a gun store and buy a rifle or pistol.

Let's get even crazier here. Let's say the second amendment gets repealed tomorrow and there is a government buy back program similar to what Australia did. There will still be hundreds of thousands of guns out there that are either a. not turned in or b. purchased illegally.

We have to be realistic. No matter how many laws get passed, shit like this will still happen. We need to pass these laws, but people need to be objective as well.",-5,0,1443798705,1444726136
