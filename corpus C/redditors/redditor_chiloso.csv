I just don't remember it as being as big a deal as recent mass shootings are, even though it was much larger in scale. I don't remember Bush addressing the nation about it, as Obama does all the time. (Maybe he did, I'm just saying it didn't get as much coverage as Obama does now.)",0,0,1443843430,1444728092
