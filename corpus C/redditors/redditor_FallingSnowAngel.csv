cvxw3i4,0,t1_cvxv644,FallingSnowAngel,"> seems he was talking about something hurtful in his past

He was talking about a woman he loved, who saw him as a passing sex toy. He never got over it. Ever. And it was all he'd talk about. It was driving other women away, and he was convinced he was a forever alone. 

She was my deepest friend, and the best ""Shoulder to cry on."" After listening to his tale of woe - the long version; she said she'd never use him. And that should have been the start of something good...

But he angrily accused her of changing the subject, instead. He wanted to talk some more about the woman who used him for sex...nothing was going to get in the way of that.

She'd already gone out of her way for him, and now, reaching out to him, she was being accused of being a selfish bitch. 

She'd had enough of his entitled, self-absorbed shit. He really didn't give a crap about anyone other than himself. 

We ditched him. Haven't talked to him since. 

> So they had sex with you without judging you.

This is curious...you're quick to observe when I'm uncomfortable talking about my strengths, but you didn't observe me being uncomfortable simply listing all of their's. 

I just assumed some things are part of every good friendship. 

And I didn't say they all had sex with me. Would you have sex with every friend who crushes on you? What if the chemistry's wrong? What if they want more than just sex? Would you lead her on?

We were in a kink community. Sex was just going to come up. It's like talking about the weather, over there. 

Those I actually let fuck me...if they couldn't make me laugh, if they couldn't offer me complete honesty, if we didn't spend so much time together, just talking about anything that came to mind... 

Serious question - have you had sex, beyond just losing your virginity? Was it really so important to you, that it would be worth sacrificing all your own ideals, your self respect? 

> Scared of losing it, I guess?

What's given suddenly, can vanish just as suddenly. I can't figure out why they wanted to be my friends. And they were using the word ""good friend"". It's just...

What the fuck are they doing in my dystopia? Can't people see I'm broken? Why can't they think I'm creepy, when there are other people who would kill for the kind of friendships I can find so easy? 

> Is that part of the hebephrenia?

Nah. Tempting to make that excuse, but it's more social anxiety and ridiculous perfectionism. 

> If they do have potential, I hope they don't think utilizing it in exchange for a girl who simply won't judge them is what they 'deserve' as human beings or something they should be grateful for.

There's a huge difference between tolerance and attraction. 

> Didn't you say you're pretty and adventurous in one of our conversations?

I said I was cute, at best, if you're being charitable. And adventurous means I'm the kind of idiot who enjoys dark alleys and hanging out with cannibalism fetishists who think a sex phobia is fun to poke at, when I'm not arguing with people who think PTSD triggers are comedy gold. 

What part of that sounds not messed up to you? 

> All kinds. I've known incels who were physically disabled, deformed, and so on.

I've met women with the same problems. Some of them would kill for a guy who understands. ",1,1,1444716955,1444719301
cvxvhlo,0,t1_cvxuj0y,FallingSnowAngel,"> Your first guy seems more eccentric than a ""loser"" to me, like I said, he doesn't fit my textbook image of the ""male loser"".

Is it textbook, or stereotype? I've never met anyone, in real life, who meets the ""angry obese shut-in fedora wearing neckbeard who wants a life like porn"" description. 

> Is she a single mom perhaps?

No.

> What is she living on disability before?

Not sure. I know she used to work Hershey Park? 

>  Did she need extra money? 

No. Actually, they don't live together. But they spend so much time together, it's like Seinfeld rules? 

> her looks

Cute face, otherwise, the redpill wouldn't even be aware she exists/would be abusive. 

> wealth

Disability checks.

> status 

Hardcore gamer, and atheist, who watches horrible/cult movies for fun. We just finished Big Trouble in Little China. If she was a guy, she'd blend right in with stereotypical internet culture. 

Although she's also some people's lifeline. Basically, life gets too shit, you come to her place for detox.  

> attractiveness

Well, for those attracted to brains and depth of personality...and we do exist...she's very attractive. But we don't make moves on people in relationships. She and Dave are happy, so...I'm glad they've got each other. 

I just wish I could find something like that, instead of just sex? 

Christ, this is getting depressing...apologies for that.

Moving on, then.

>  I've never really told off anyone in my entire life.

That can be good or bad. Do people take advantage? 

>  At least I can't be blamed for being so jaded after spending time on Reddit, I guess.

I think we tend to focus on the negative here, because we've eliminated any community in most subreddits. Moral outrage buys karma, as does sex and comedy. And most of us might as well be anonymous in the larger subreddits. We're simply milked for fresh content...",1,1,1444715117,1444719301
cvxuvi6,0,t1_cvxu4k3,FallingSnowAngel,"> What happened next? He screamed at her? insulted her?

He accused her of not giving a shit about his pain. He wanted a therapy session, not a date. And yeah, people need to give more of a shit about each other, but...

Hmm...I think, reading the rest of your post, we're talking about two different populations of people. Those I've interacted with, argue that they're forever alone, but they're not part of an organized internet community? 

This leads to all kinds of questions about the differences between them - feel free to mock me for my ignorance on this one. 

> I would make a sardonic comment about what THEY offered you 

They knew I was afraid of sex, but they didn't judge me, the way most people do. In fact, they made sure I faced my fears, instead of hiding from them.

More important, they gave me a community. Someplace I almost belonged...

You know what's fucked up? That scares me worse than the thought of dying alone. 

Yesterday, I made new friends. Today, I'm hiding from them on Reddit. I'm way more okay with talking to you, tomorrow...

I have no fucking idea why I'm not an incel. 

I'm mostly only doing this, because I have a personal belief, that incels don't know their own potential. There's no way, they can be as messed up as I am. I mean, I'm struggling with hebephrenia...

Who has no filter, and is terrible at understanding basic human interaction. He rambles, all over the place. He comes across like he's high.

Do they jump in the air? Do they yelp? Can you fuck with their heads without even trying?

Not in the least. Average build for a short middle aged man who doesn't exercise, grey beard, wrinkles, lost puppy look.

> age

She's 46, and he's 58. They met when she was 30. 

> rich family?

Rich? No. But her's isn't hurting for money. They both live on disability. There are times when she might be happier, if she could leave, but she's loyal to everyone she meets. Friends, family, etc. 

Then again, the same is true of everyone in my contact circle, so take it for what it's worth. We've got each other's backs, and until I came to Reddit, I never understood it's value. ",1,0,1444711952,1444719301

Welcome to the rest of the world. We actually have reasons for believing the things we do, that have nothing to do with you. 

> So you have zero other redeeming qualities? Because that's what it would mean to claim they crushed on you just because of that.

...okay, fair point on that one. You're right. But anything else I offered them isn't an unobtainable goal. I still believe the bar has been set artificially low.

I don't think you're evil. I think you mean well. But those who felt sorry for me, nearly kept me from ever losing my own virginity.
