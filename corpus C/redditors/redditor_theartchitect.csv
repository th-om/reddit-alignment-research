cvuwjmi,1,t3_3o72sr,theartchitect,"Heated? Probably Rockets. Our series with the Clippers last year was borderline cordial. There seems to be a lot of respect when they meet, also, with GS, Memphis, Lebron's Team, and Mavericks. When I think heated, I think who are we gonna lose our cool against. Immediately, the Rockets, Lakers (Kobe), and OKC (Westbrook).  But Harden has annoyed and been outright hateful of the (Champion) Spurs so many times in the past, its hard not to think a team like Houston does outright want to beat us more than any other team in the league, and us them.

cvigvdo,0,t1_cvicgd1,theartchitect,"Agreed, Tim and Manu handled themselves, but Pop does get credit for a lot of that. Tony will be a true measure, and he may not go so quietly into the night. Not sure.",1,0,1443556912,1444731358
cvgucia,1,t3_3mor30,theartchitect,"I agree whole-heartedly. If Patty gets starter minutes v LAC we win that series. I think this issue is a true test of Pops clout. Hes able to reign in a Ginobili or a Duncan, can he say to Parker ""I know being a starter in the NBA drives up your value and maintains your legacy in France, but Mills is just the better option now"" and not have Tony check out conpletely? I hope so, but I dont know

cv9b83r,1,t3_3lswox,theartchitect,"I understand the sentiment, 3D World is a GREAT, GREAT game, and an essential game for the Wii U (as there are so few already), but don't trade one classic for another. Especially since 3D World is a little less expensive these days. KEEP THEM BOTH! SMM may have not connected with your nostalgic Mario senses, but that's why you're supposed to go in there and make one yourself! People are doing all kinds of crazy crap with their levels, and then there are also people just trying to make the most playable levels possible, but the Maker is satisfying to me in so many ways. It allows me to pull stuff from my brain and decide at the moment what level I wanna create and, thus, play. Go back to the store and get SMM, so when you're done with 3D World (which, BTW, the last level will drive you nuts) you'll be inspired to revisit the older 2d platform!!",1,0,1442862239,1444731358
cv883xd,1,t3_3ldndm,theartchitect,"I think Patty should be allowed to start a majority of games this year. People like to point out his flaws, but he doesn't get enough credit for running the floor, being a pest, and making clutch shots. This year, I'd take Patty as a starter for 70% of the games.
