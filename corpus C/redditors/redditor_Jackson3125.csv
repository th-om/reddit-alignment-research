[Here is a great article demonstrating the process.](http://tobyhemenway.com/resources/how-to-the-ultimate-bomb-proof-sheet-mulch/) Keep in mind, however, that is an awesome, thorough version. Yours doesn't need to be near as extensive for it to work. At the end of the day, a foot of *any* type of organic material on top is going to help your soil immensely. 

You should also pick up a Ruth Stout book, too. She has a very similar process. ",1,0,1444685792,1444728030

I would give the plants a few weeks before you start any kind of harvesting (you can take the peppers whenever they're ready, though) or pruning. I would think they need some more time to acclimate before you shock them further. 

>All the plants were put in new indoor potting soil without fertilizer.

Had you fertilized the plants in the ground recently? If not, I would wait a week and apply fertilizer as required by each individual plant species.  

Depending on fertilization, watering, etc, you should see some growth within a three or four weeks at the latest.  

I'm not sure about the cuttings, though. I don't have any experience with herb cuttings. ",2,0,1444682648,1444728030

cvx836y,1,t3_3ogyiv,Jackson3125,"###If your only option is to plant the seeds you have already purchased, wait until the proper time. 

Planting seeds at the improper time will not yield good results and more often than not it will yield no results at all. Plants know if it's their time to shine (germinate or grow) based on temperature, amount of sunlight in a day, moisture levels, etc. If you think you can fool them just by planting them in the ground, you're wrong. In fact, if you think you can fool them at all then you're probably wrong, too (unless you're a much better gardener than I am). 

###If you want to provide her something nice in the meantime, go buy a flat of pansies or three. 

Pansies, ironically enough, are some of the toughest flowers readily available for purchase. Buy a bag of compost and a flat or three of pansies and make an area of her yard pretty with them. (Dig a hole. Put a handful of compost in the bottom. Put the pansy in the hole where the top of the dirt (root ball) the plant came in is 1/2"" above the dirt in the ground. Pile about 1"" of compost around the plant but not touching the stem. Repeat. Also, plant them close together in a bunch for aesthetic reasons. Think of it as a tiny field of flowers.) 

She will love you for it and the pansies themselves have a much better chance of surviving than any seeds you casually stick in the ground. You could also plant some snapdragons behind them; they're also tough, survive the winter (at least in my area) and are taller than pansies so you can use them as an aesthetic backdrop. 

Once you've planted the pansies, research the seeds you've already purchased, make a gameplan, and then come Spring it will be your time to shine because you'll be well prepared and timely (and your mom will be very, very happy about her kind, green-thumbed offspring). 

###Planting from seed can be hard. 

Growng plants from seed can be hard (depending on the plant). Very, very hard. (That's why nurseries exist) You've got to plant them at the *right* time and provide the *right* amount of TLC or you're not going to have a good time. Even when you do follow all the proper instructions for various seeds you'll have plants die or just plain fail to germinate for no cognizable reason. (No, I'm not bitter. Ok, yes, I'm kind of bitter.) 

I say this to you only to save you some heartache: **If you are new to gardening, start with plants, not seeds.** Preferably tough plants well suited for your soil and climate, which your local nursery can help you find.


I hope that helps and keep being awesome by providing your mom a cool garden. ",5,0,1444676725,1444728030

Try either (1) cooking your bacon at a lower temp or (2) let your pan cool significantly longer before you start the eggs. ",4,0,1444620632,1444728030
