In case anyone else is following the thread, I'll reply to this:

>Employees are always paid less than the value they generate for an employer. That's just basic business sense. 

I think we're on the same page here.

>What I meant by subsidizing corporate profits is that if someone has a job and still requires assistance then the corporation is basically not paying the employee a fair wage.

A 'fair' wage is a wage that compensates someone for their work, not a wage that compensates them for their needs. A person's needs really aren't the concern of two parties involved in a trade. I'm open to the possibility otherwise, but it would take a very solid argument to tie employee needs to wages, rather than tying civilian needs to safety nets (which is pretty straightforward).",1,0,1444604619,1444729609

To start with, you'd have to assert that what an employer owes to an employee is *not* related to what value the employee generates for the employer, and instead assert that what employer owes the employee depends on what the employee needs. This of course would create an environment where the employer is incentivized to hire employees with little needs.",1,0,1444600904,1444729609

Absolutely not. If the person's not able to support themselves, then a safety net should catch them. There's no reason to place that burden on a business.",0,0,1444586171,1444729609
