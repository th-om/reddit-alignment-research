cvx0vp4,1,t3_3ogkll,ariverboatgambler,"There's one theory that states the abortion debate is so vitriolic is because it was decided by the Supreme Court and not within the confines of the various legislatures.  Basically, in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision abortion went from being legal in less than 10 states (mostly on the coasts) to every state overnight.  The case was centered around the abortion rights of one woman in Texas, and with Roe's victory there was now a constitutional right to abortion for every woman in the country virtually instantaneously.  It's really tough to think of another example of a civil right that was granted so sweepingly, so quickly, with such little popular support nationwide.

Ever since 1973, abortion rights proponents have basically been on the defensive.  Their position essentially ""won"" immediately and the only place to go from there was down.  Every year in dozens of states new abortion restrictions are passed and are challenged in the courts.  Every once in a while, something makes its way up to the Supreme Court and something small is changed, but the right still stands largely intact.  As a quick aside, keep an eye out for a potentially landmark abortion decision this June regarding burdensome regulations on abortion clinics.

From the Roe v. Wade decision and earlier decisions by the Warren Court in the 1960s that opened up a lot of new civil rights, there was born an opposition judicial movement that took the position that the Constitution is not a living document and that the Founders meant it to mean exactly what it says.  This is called textualism and sometimes perjoratively as originalism.  This subject is another really long answer and a separate discussion, but partly from the Roe v. Wade decision there's been this ongoing conflict in the judicial system about how to apply the Constitution that's spilled over into lots of other different fields.  

There are other contentious issues regarding life and death that don't get nearly as much pull as abortion.  I think the reason it is so prominent in American discourse is how it came into existence.  Frankly, if you can catch an abortion rights proponent in an honest moment, I bet he or she would regret Roe v. Wade.  Not for what was decided, but for how it came into being.  Yes, they won, but at a price of splitting popular support into even, fiercely divisive halves, and an outlook of forever battling anti-abortion proponents.

cvjeg2y,1,t3_3myrv9,ariverboatgambler,"The efficacy of airstrikes without ground forces is marginal.  Just think about it, the country is already four years into an extreme civil war.  Most of the population centers that aren't Damascus or border the Med have been destroyed.  Continually bombing the same destroyed targets will be as effective as the current US-led coalition airstrikes.  

Perhaps the Russians will place more Special Forces in Syria to help direct their strikes better than the coalition has, and certainly the Russian rules of engagement will be less stringent than those imposed from Washington.  Still, there's only so much that can be done.  For example, during the Vietnam Era there was more gross bomb tonnage dropped on Cambodia than there was dropped across the world during the entirety of World War II.  

Russian involvement still doesn't change the fact that the Syrian Regime forces are critically depleted of manpower from years of casualties and desertions.  The battle has been stalemated for years now, and without significant infusions of manpower I just don't see how that's going to change.  Hezbollah is already largely committed to the fight on behalf of Assad, and the Syrian regime doesn't have any geographically close allies.  I just don't see where the next surge will come from in order to aid the Assad side.  

I think the smart money here is that there will be a perpetual civil war with foreign involvement in Syria a-la Afghanistan from 1979-1996.  Perhaps events could have been better influenced with more forceful US action in 2012, but time is too late now.  It's an unbelievable quagmire and tragedy now.  

*Quick Correction - I misremembered the details of the bombs over Cambodia.  It should have read ""Dropped on North Vietnam than there was dropped on Germany, Italy, and Japan"".  I think the point still stands, though.  The NVA still succeeded.  ",7,0,1443629099,1444721622

cuw19pi,0,t1_cuvxh13,ariverboatgambler,"This is a really good write up.  

If I may, I just want to add a couple quick points.  In The Bin Ladens, also by Steve Coll, it was revealed that the children of Mohammed Bin Laden, Osama's father, each received an inheritance of around $2.5-$3 million each.  This was revealed in an affidavit in Los Angeles County District Court during a divorce hearing between one of Osama's many half brothers.  For a long time, there was a belief put out by the CIA and FBI that Bin Laden himself was worth hundred and hundreds of millions dollars that he received from his family.  The specifics of his inheritance are likely unprovable, but I think it's no longer widely accepted that Bin Laden funded Al-Qaeda entirely by himself.  

From 1984-1988(ish), Bin Laden and some other like minded individuals formed and ran the Afghan Services Bureau out of Peshawar in Pakistan.  This was the vehicle that funneled so much wealth into the region upon which the future Al-Qaeda was built.  According to Steve Coll in both ""Ghost Wars"" and ""The Bin Ladens"", Arab fighters in Afghanistan were minor celebrities in the Gulf region and money from Arab donors and governments flowed generously.  The Afghan Services Bureau sort of billed itself as a staging ground for fighters from the Gulf traveling into Afghanistan, and would help with logistics and such.  Now, it's stated by Coll in one of the books, I forget which, that the CIA was giving matching funds to whatever money the Saudi intelligence service would give to Arab Mujahidin.  As stated above, there was also a lot of arms and material that was given to the fighters as well during this period.  

This is becoming a longer post than I wanted, but I believe a more accurate statement is that ""money, weapons, and supplies given by the US and the Gulf States to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan was later used by Al-Qaeda for different purposes"".  In intelligence and political science parlance, this is called blowback.  ",2,0,1441832735,1444721622
