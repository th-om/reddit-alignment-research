cvupk8w,1,t3_3o0hak,joshamania,"Talk to the construction companies in your area.  The big ones, the ones that build schools and arenas and such.  They get all kinds of projects, not just huge things, and they sub out everything.

You can ask to get put on their bid list and let them know your capabilities and availability.  When a project comes up, you'll get a chance to bid on it.  I've seen plenty of arenas built, but also plenty of small libraries, tiny firehouses, fast food joints, additions to existing buildings.  Stuff like installing a service (which will be pre-engineered, usually) and running a couple dozen  or hundred feet of wire and/or conduit.  Stuff that you and a laborer could knock out easily.

The bid list is the way to get your foot in the door, but the way to keep getting work is establishing a relationship.  Big construction is a small community.  Even when people only work a couple years in a job, they're almost always going to do something similar with a local competitor...and there are plenty of lifers in these places.

Everyone knows everyone and a lot of the business is done based on relationships.  The lowest bid doesn't always win.

So a lot of these places are cool and they're usually cool about helping other businesses succeed and giving new people a shot.  You'll get a chance to bid and you can usually find these people in person to talk to them.  If you don't win a bid it's never a terrible idea to go see them in person and get yourself an explanation of what you could have done better, to help you win the next time.

If you win a couple small jobs, and you do a good job knocking them out, that opens the door for a lot more work.

And talk to the parts-counter people at your local electrical supply houses.  They know *everything* and *everyone*.

edit: Be warned that this type of work can take a long time to get paid for.  But if you can make it steady work, that takes care of itself.",1,0,1444479381,1444727472

cvsf0no,0,t1_cvsefgw,joshamania,"In a perfect world, I'd agree with you.  Execution is too easy for the individual, but one cannot deny the politics of the situation.  The whole Bin Laden thing went so far beyond anything simple.  I also happen to think that the fallout from having him in prison or ""officially"" executing him would have been bad.  

Another issue to consider is that this isn't Nuremberg.  The ""war"" isn't over and I certainly think that having Bin Laden alive would have created a type of Mary Queen of Scots kind of atmosphere.  Someone for the opposition to rally around, causing yet more trouble.

Who knows?  It never happened so we'll never really know what could have been.  ",2,0,1444309329,1444727472

That's just how CIA/NSA/GCHQ operate.  They don't talk about anything and their job is not that to produce evidence in a trial.  Whether what they do makes them look bad or good, they don't talk.

They could have a recording, even a *legal* one (though that definition is considered by more than a few to be tenuous at best), of an American helping some foreign terrorist group to launder money and *at most* they're going to tell the FBI ""you need to check this guy out""...and even then it's debatable.  Maybe they don't want their source investigated, but they sure as shit aren't going to provide a recording or even let anyone know they have one because that's state secrets stuff.

There's not going to be any paper trail, any official orders...even financial records...nothing...to directly link Bin Laden to any act performed by Al Qaeda.  They've got an untraceable [financial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala) in the Arab world that would hide any such links.",1,0,1444307002,1444727472
