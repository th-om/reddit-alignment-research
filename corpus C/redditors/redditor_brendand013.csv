cub4ny9,1,t3_3hw10t,brendand013,"I feel like people miss two important aspects of normalizing relations with Iran:

1. The Iranian government is pretty moderate and the majority of its citizens are between 18-30 years old, are well educated, and pro west. Only the ayatollahs chant death to America but we put them into the ""Axis of Evil"" for essentially no reason at all as they were helping us fight Al Qaida at the time so it's basically a wash. 

2. Iran has promised to help fight ISIS and Iran has an incredibly strategic geographic location that works in our favor in the fight against ISIS. we have turkey to the north, Saudi Arabia to the south and Iran in the east which puts ISIS in a weak position if we have all three of these countries fighting against them as a common enemy.

cub3s9w,0,t1_cub24nd,brendand013,"It does not disprove what Frank did that is why I am looking into the issue because I do not know everything, but I do know this blame game of who is at fault is pointless as there were many factors at play. Blaming government or the private sector entirely is an exercise in futility. 

There were bailouts across the board. Bailouts for the auto industry, homeowners, banks, insurance agencies, etc. Whether the bailouts worked or were justified is another argument.

A central bank is necessary for capitalism to function with a uniform domestic currency, without it the dollar as we know it would not exist. Jackson closing the central bank exacerbated the Panic of 1837. I don't disagree that the fed is anti-market, but I do not think that is absolutely a bad thing in general.

Spreading the wealth fairly is not the same as spreading it out equally as in communism. I never advocated for equality and furthermore our debt has little to do with what I am saying. Ronald Reagan took on massive debt, as did George Bush, was this in pursuit of fairness? The logical conclusion to fairness is a progressive tax system to fund public works. Every time we have cut taxes the benefits were felt disproportionately by the top earners. Debt can be attributed to many other factors and when dealing with the global economy is not necessarily a bad thing.

I never said that capitalism was bad just that it is factual that unfettered markets disproportionately benefit the wealthy and that is the way it has been throughout all of history. IF you do not see that then you clearly are the one who does not have a grasp of reality. Why would Roosevelt need to break up monopolies if the free market works for the betterment of everyone?

I am no idealist and no an open economy does not function like that. A free trade economy only functions with the assumption that labor also moves freely. We have moved much of our manufacturing overseas, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does come at the cost of American jobs. Once again this is not a criticism just a fact. And there is a finite amount of the pie, take oil for example. We will run out some day. And just being willing to work is not always enough. You say you know economics therefore you would be aware of the fact that unemployment is cyclical and sometimes there reaches a point where there are more people looking for work than is available, giving employers a superior bargaining position at the cost of laborers. 

The closest thing I have argued for is a mixed economy which we have had since the beginning of the 20th century. I do not think you are wrong in what you are saying but neither am I. I am simply expressing my skepticism for an unregulated free market in completely reasonable and justified terms. ",1,0,1440190575,1444725403
cub0cma,0,t1_cuazh67,brendand013,"That video is the exact reason I am skeptical of this book. The idea of expanding home ownership was not the be all end all cause. They expanded home ownership to poor people through the Community Reinvestment Act, yet most of the defaults happened in middle to high income households once home values began to drop.  Furthermore, very few of the defaults were traced to mortgages backed by the CRA compared to those based in the private sector.  The fact that there was more risk and less government oversight that allowed for risky investments to be made by brokers who knew that the loans they were granting people were at a high risk of default. Therefore, taking that into consideration, it seems to me that if there was more regulation preventing subprime loans in the private sector, that would have prevented the crisis. 

The central bank fixing rates may also be anti free market but a central bank is the only way to maintain a uniform currency. When Andrew Jackson closed the Fed it created a worse depression than the Great Depression. Capitalism has made everyone in America richer you are right, but it is not laissez-faire capitalism, it is a mixed economy with regulations put in place specifically to spread the wealth more fairly (e.g. Roosevelt and Trust-busting) but if you follow our supply chains you will find that much of our riches rest on the backs of poor nations with fewer rights than we have here. There is a reason Foxconn exists. You cannot have cheap goods without cheap labor and you cannot even manufacture goods without getting materials cheaply which is why profit based market capitalism is inherently imperialistic. 

I have no better solution really but you are wrong in thinking that everyone prospers in capitalism. Our poor may have nice things but there is no prosperity without someone somewhere getting the short end of the stick. The government is only a problem because it no longer works for the benefit of the people. If politics actually strove for the greater human good we would not be in this mess. I concede that the government is the source of many problems as it has been corrupted by moneyed interests which are the exact same interests that I see endorsing this book, hence my skepticism.",1,0,1440185238,1444725403
cuayabi,0,t1_cuaxz2y,brendand013,The private sector was not at fault for the 2009 recession it was the governments fault entirely and only free market capitalism can bring us to prosperity. If your next question is why I oppose it I would answer that I don't outright oppose it I am simply skeptical of that position because I know that under laissez faire capitalism wealth concentrates at the top and that distribution of wealth is what I oppose. If it can be shown that unregulated markets can create a proportional level of benefit for all while maintaining worker and human rights by all means I would be on board. This doesn't mean I oppose markets I just don't blame the government for all our problems. ,1,0,1440182092,1444725403
cuaxr0h,0,t1_cuax8mo,brendand013,Well I am not entirely sure I only mean that insofar as it probably has an agenda and I don't want to be mislead. It is very easy to twist things to support some kind of pre-ordained notion. I tend to be skeptical of free market solutions but by no means do I oppose it dogmatically. ,1,0,1440181306,1444725403
cu5yg7x,1,t3_3h98ok,brendand013,"In fine with it because I don't see it in the way you are describing it. While it is putting subsidized housing in more affluent areas, the idea is to cut down on segregation and the cycle of poverty. If you look at a map with demographic data you would be able to see how there are a ton of areas that are still very segregated. Brooklyn has an entire area filled with only white people right next to one with only black people. There are also many people in poor areas who do work hard and want to move up but very often the good jobs and schools are out of reach as you would need a car to go long distances that would be unaffordable without a good job in the first place. 

I see this legislation as trying to compel local city planners to do a better job laying out the city in order to make it more integrated and have the opportunity to prosper more evenly available. ",1,0,1439825995,1444725403
csyywdm,1,t3_3ctw6g,brendand013,"We need to curb the cost of healthcare before we can do anything else about the problems our economy faces really. Technology will make our lives easier and perhaps there will be new jobs as a result, only time will tell. Besides, income inequality has more to do with how our economy is set up and the growth of globalization as well as stagnant wages.  Taxing the rich will just move money off shore, where it already is for the most part, and raising the minimum wage will help us in the long run but it may cost us more jobs in the short term by sending those jobs overseas or automating them. Really the biggest cost besides wages to businesses are benefits as a whole and healthcare is a huge chunk of it. There is evidence to show that the lower the cost of healthcare, the higher wages become. So really fixing healthcare costs will help businesses, small and large, consumers, and workers. It is the closest thing to a silver bullet we have.",1,0,1436559182,1444725403

csygdhh,1,t3_3crsbn,brendand013,Many things are agreeable or at least in part we just don't hear about them. Unfortunately taxes and minimum wage are issues that people do not have a consensus on and I doubt there really will ever be one because tax rates have been debated since their inception. Although I would agree with you in that pundits make everything sound much worse than it is. Everything they say is really just a constant barrage of outrage. But there are times of sobriety too. I remember seeing Bill O'Reilly talk about the confederate flag and without hesitation and with great articulation explained how it was hateful to black Americans. In the next breath he started insulting the youth of America but hey he's and entertainer for the older crowd.  ,3,0,1436526285,1444725403
csy7d0x,0,t1_csy4vy8,brendand013,"You are right. What I'm saying is that the current minimum wage, especially when coupled with government assistance, does constitute livable to many people. I do want minimum wage to be raised or some sort of basic income to be implemented instead. But while raising it to $9-$10, which according the the CBO are the only two amounts that would have the least amount of negative impacts on our economy, would be beneficial, by your own definition these still wouldn't be livable which proves my overarching point that a ""livable wage"" is subjective and is not a feasible or useful solution to the problems we face. If anyone has any issue with anything I am saying I want to see what amount they would set a livable wage at. ",2,0,1436498446,1444725403
