conkzps,1,t3_2w48fq,chessmaster9000,"Yeah, I used amphetamine salts last semester to study and it is great as long as you are disciplined and responsible. Here are my tips for disciplined and responsible amphetamine use:
1.) Invest in a good scale! Trust me, when you accidentally dose 150mg instead of 15, your studying becomes manic, obsessive rambling. Which leads me to...
2.) Less is more! At a certain point, the speed productivity transitions toward drug induced insanity. I advise not to dose more than 50mg or so at a time, redose no more than once without sleeping and not dose more than 3 times in a week. It is a fine line between student and speed freak.
3.) Sleeping, hygeine and eating trumps studying! If you can't sleep, you stop showering and you don't eat, your grades will go down the drain and everyone will abandon you as you descend into amphetamine psychosis. Keep track of your health and prioritize it over all else.
4.) Yes, amphetamines might help get work done, but it is you who must do the work. Any assignment you can do on amphetamines, you can do without amphetamines if you want to. It is just a bit less fun.
Never allow yourself the psychology to become dependent on the amphetamines. That is how you fuck it all up.


Last semester I was not responsible. I ended up living in the woods near campus, obsessively studying chemistry, doing upwards of a gram of amphetamines a week. I became convinced that my classes were teaching elementary concepts and I could learn far more on my own. So I stopped attending and my grades tanked even though I was actually learning a lot. Unsuprisingly, I got pneumonia from not sleeping, eating or really ever going inside except to the library. Finally the semester ended and I had failed everything, written an entirely incomprehensible textbook on organic chemistry, and gone batshit crazy. I was self-aware that amphetamines were consuming me so I quit cold turkey, slept 16 hours a day and was a complete prick for a week and now I think I have learned my lesson.

TL; DR: It should work if you are careful. ",10,0,1424131061,1444720540
