I'd say Asia is the most diverse.  More than half the world's languages are spoken there, and there are too many ethnic groups to even count.  I think this whole debate over who's more diverse is kind of pointless anyways though.",-3,0,1443657679,1444731390

China, a country of over a billion has a plethora of ethnic groups that coexist (with the exception of Tibet but that's a whole different animal).  The Middle East isn't just Arabs you know right.

Many of these migrants had good jobs and careers before being forced to flee.  You really think its greedy do to want to maintain some semblance of your former life rather than be a beggar or menial worker for the rest of your life?  What's wrong with immigrating to somewhere where there's more opportunities?  Isn't that precisely what European immigrants did when coming to America in the 1800s. Apparently wanting to move your family to somewhere where thy have a better future is ""greedy"".",0,0,1443652276,1444731390
