cvrk2lu,0,t1_cvrhuwn,Tripanes,"This AI interpreted a question in a way a human would not, this does not make it stupid or not conscious.

To expect AI to think, act, see the world, in a similar way to how people do, when AI have little but text or sensors far more simple than human senses to interact with the world, is incorrect.  A sentient AI could well be one to say something like this.  

However, modern AI aren't anywhere near what anyone would call consciousness though, I agree with you there.",6,0,1444242707,1444731076
