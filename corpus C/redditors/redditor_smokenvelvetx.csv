cvuppvc,1,t3_3o70uc,smokenvelvetx,"I thought about making this post last month but I knew the way I presented it would never get any visibility, thank you for giving this issue the presentation and treatment it needs to get up voted. 

IceFrog is enforcing an action meta in all the wrong ways, and it makes all games feel exactly the same.  It's actually boring as a spectator.  The 5 man meta can't end soon enough. The more heroes are balanced around an enforced meta, the more they are enforcing the meta as well.  There is nothing wrong with many heroes that are not seeing play-time but AOE and comeback gold has made them effectively obsolete.  Instead, IceFrog is now going to buff them.  

The fact that your supports can just reap money off of an enemy carry is totally backwards.  Why not use team net worth instead of hero net worth?  Why even have a system that takes into account net worth?  It's obvious that this is a purposely enforced meta because there is almost no other way they could do it and had to use this ridiculous hidden gold mechanic to do it.  We all can feel the difference of trying to play a 4 protect 1 split push strategy as opposed to an early 5 man roaming strategy, but we can't say why only one of these strategies is viable.  It's the hidden gold mechanic.  ",14,0,1444479965,1444721254
cvte41u,1,t3_3o0toq,smokenvelvetx,"if you have the better late game, you just want to spread the map out if your team is feeding and ur participation with them in the frenzy wont make the difference, buy items that will help you take towers, sometimes thats shadow blade or necrobook or some other item.  the goal is to make the most room possible for your team to have a chance to comeback.

if you have the early game, you want to group with your team and start making things happen, if your team is just bad players and wont organize, you need to be warding and buying smokes and you need to try and give your team aggressive vision, and a reason to group up, this is harder to do than dragging out a game

Also hz is a typo, I mean 144fps, as I'll be using an external 144hz monitor when playing most of the time.  75hz on the laptop monitor itself is fine.

cvs72nr,1,t3_3nwpdf,smokenvelvetx,"cleaving heroes is why you buy bf on PA

if it didnt work on heroes nobody would buy it except shitters that still think its a farming item.  it's a fighting item for PA.

other than that, cleave is useful against heroes but ussually only when it's setup i.e. black hole, rp, vacuum, etc. ",-7,0,1444281529,1444721254

cvs70hq,1,t3_3nxovc,smokenvelvetx,"you are averaging twelve deaths a game on dazzle so you're doing something wrong

carry tp scroll.  if anything bad happens just shallow grave and tp out.  that alone should help you improve with this hero.

but it won't fix the problem which is that you are dying too much and not contributing enough.  try finding a mentor or paying for some coaching.  you will get alot of it, i assure you. ",2,0,1444281371,1444721254
cvr8hvp,1,t3_3nrht1,smokenvelvetx,"a few things

this guy needs armor.  heals are most valuable when health points can absorb the most damage.  this is what makes blademail so good. it doens't just boost your mana pool, and give you damage and reflect, it's the armor that really helps.  this is also why shivas is so good, it helps you control the zone around necro, and at the same time gives you a huge mana pool and a huge amount of armor, and slows attackspeed.  mekansm is an alternative to blademail. 

consider every item when playing necro, euls, shadowblade, solar crest, halberd, bkb, forcestaff, necrobook, etc.  the hero can put almost every item in the game to decent use in the right situations.
