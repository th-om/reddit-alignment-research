cvkaavp,1,t3_3n2lc2,clay3r,"My subtank ni200 coils last a week. Taste is great and no dry hits. I don't know why it's not working for you. Regular .5 ohm coils don't last as long for me.

I don't vape all day though because I work 8 hours a day and can't vape on the job. Honestly, I love temperature control on tanks. I think it's fantastic. I like standard kanthal on my rbas though. Also, I use 70/30 or 50/50 (vg/pg) and I've never had a problem.

I've tried 90/10 in my tanks and I had the same problems. If that's not your problem, I don't know what to tell you. ",1,0,1443684702,1444732102
