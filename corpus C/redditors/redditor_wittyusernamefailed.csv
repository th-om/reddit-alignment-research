cvx86xm,0,t1_cvw8yuh,wittyusernamefailed,"At this point what Turkey wants is a moot point. The U.S. is now finding much of it's influence in the Levant being taken by Russia, and with few reliable allie in which to offset it. The YPG has been one of those few that we can depend on, so at this point strengthening them and helping their influence expand becomes of paramount importance. Syria was never in our influence, and Iraq is quickly going to Iran (and in some respects russia) so it becomes a matter of realpolitik; unless we actully want to send in ground troops, which i can't see Pres. Obama having the guts for yet.",1,0,1444676878,1444725488
cvgswoc,1,t3_3mos4j,wittyusernamefailed,"It will probably be more ""exciting evidence!"" that there was once flowing water on mars that ""might"" have supported life.

The Red Cross would be another, you know that organization that helps feed and cloth all the people fleeing the Islamic wonderland that is the Caliphate?

cv6ft2x,1,t3_3lgc8r,wittyusernamefailed,"One worrying aftermath of these reports and the news of the information about the war being doctored is a resurgence of very hawkish behavior. members of both parties in congress (as well as most of the Presidential candidates) are starting to trip over themselves to vocally call for ""more forceful measures"" If the administration had actually had a realistic plan in the beginning (instead of this very fanciful dream of ""Hundreds of vetted Syrian fighters"") we wouldn't be where we are, with things getting worse, Russia joining in, temptation to use more force than is needed looming in the minds of an administration obsessed with leaving with some middle east peace legacy.",3,0,1442619879,1444725488

cv4k6io,1,t3_3l99f7,wittyusernamefailed,"Rubio seemed the most ""presidential"", he was at ease, had tremendous energy, had obviously did his homework and wasn't stumped by questions.
