cvxut5s,1,t3_3ofaac,Oreo_Speedwagon,"Here's the thing: It isn't even like video games are set in the U.S.  How many video games do you know set in Florida?  Or Philadelphia?  Or Colorado?  Or Louisiana?  Las Vegas?

No, the vast majority of games are set in either California or New York City (Or a stand-in for 'em, like Liberty City.)  I think it's because that's where the people who develop film and TV are from, and games take a huge amount of influence from them -- are often times mimicking them -- and that's trickled down in to games.

It's a one-in-a-decade thing for a city when not-California or not-NYC is the setting for a game.  Georgia gets the Walking Dead, and uh, I guess Left 4 Dead 2 (Which most likely was an influence of the comic).  I can't think of a game ever set in Philadelphia -- wasn't the cancelled Homefront game gonna be there?  Texas gets the occasional game like Red Dead Redemption or Call of Juarez, but is pigeon-holed as ""That place Westerns happen"".  There will never be a GTA: Houston.  Boston's getting Fallout 4, but before that?  I couldn't name you a game set in Boston.

Personally, I'd love to see a lot more variety in locations.  So sure, fuck it, give us France.  Give us South Korea.  Give us Brazil or Kazakhstan.  I am just so fucking tired of New York.",1,1,1444713248,1444716961

Russia's response to direct Saudi intervention in Syria *might* be -- in the most batshit insane scenario -- a conventional assault on KSA.  That takes weeks of preparation to do, something Russia ground forces haven't done since 1979.  And that's when KSA would aquire that nuke, for regime survival.  Whoops, suddenly that conventional threat Russia holds is useless.

Russia wouldn't just randomly nuke Saudi Arabia.  You'd have to be batshit, bonkers, totally insane to nuke Mecca.  I'm not even sure why I am deigning this with a reply, but I am pretty bored at night.",0,0,1444708409,1444716961

> Western intelligence agencies believe that the Saudi monarchy paid for up to 60 per cent of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, in return for the ability to buy warheads for itself at short notice. Any failure by Iran to provide the necessary safeguards by the end of this month could see Riyadh activate that deal, thereby enabling Saudi Arabia to become the Arab world’s first nuclear power.

If Russia were to try to go hard against the Saudis, starting to move heavy equipment and troops in the region, the Saudis would very, very quickly become a nuclear-armed state.
