cvxgawl,0,t1_cvxe5jg,ChronaMewX,"They could get around it by wiping his memory of the events (screw around with a future doctor instead of a past one) combined with taking him back to the moment he left. From his perspective he'd have still been there the entire time. But still, we have other breaks in his tenure so we should just use those",2,0,1444688743,1444723205
cvw5cxi,0,t1_cvw3wtm,ChronaMewX,"I never said to make counterfeiting not be a crime, just remove the copyright on ideas. Allow everyone to make a Mario or Zelda or Pokemon game. Allow them to make their own cards similar to them if they want to. I wasn't extending it to selling someone else's exact product for a lower price - removing restrictions on ideas allows people to use those ideas to make new and potentially better things without allowing people to literally rip off and sell each others products",0,0,1444594418,1444723205
cvw3jux,0,t1_cvw3alh,ChronaMewX,"People watch them free on file sharing now, I don't see how it would make things any different. All it would do is increase creativity by not artificially limiting the market. If you want to make a game where Pikachu beats up characters from My Little Pony, you'd be free to do that. It won't stop Nintendo from creating the next Pokémon games and it won't stop me from buying them. Even if other people make knockoffs (which they already do via rom hacks and such), my decision to purchase a game relies on the merit of the game in question and not in the copyright. If every company made Pokémon then the best ones would win and the best ones would almost invariably be the originals. ",2,0,1444591754,1444723205
