cvwbcbb,0,t1_cvvlqye,ptpatil,"Check out GPU training NNs like the other user suggested, but also another point, we have applied evolutionary aglorithms to the construction/structure of neural networks. Check out this open source project called [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) and [HyperNEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNEAT), frameworks that create random phenotypes of neural networks with learned genotypes that it can then put into a domain and optimize as populations with gene propagation etc.

I am excited to see how these evolutionary approaches and how autoencoded features combine.",1,0,1444604084,1444731724

It's like me saying ""In my experience black people are lazy, at least the ones I know"". I would expect someone to comment on my assertion providing at the least a experience to the contrary, or even better, sourced, objective information.

As someone who belongs to the generalized group, I chose to comment, point out the anecdotal nature of his experience and then provide my own experience in contrast.

Oh and OC stands for original content by the way, OP is original poster. Idiot.",-1,0,1444079968,1444731724

cvpb9gw,0,t1_cvpauwe,ptpatil,"Pffft, yea you can fuck riiiight off. He was generalizing dog owners based off of ""people he knew"". Which is why I added the ""hanging out with"", because I wanted to illustrate why his anecdotal claim was wrong and a counterclaim could easily be made.

And no I'm not bragging, quite the opposite, I think most dog owners love their dog and just like it's not a notable or praiseworthy thing to do the bare minimum of feeding and taking care of your child as a parent, it is similarly expected that you either he a good dog owner or one that is generally intending to be one but maybe a little misinformed.

And ""hanging out with bad dog owners"" is not much of an insult.

Fuckin reddit
