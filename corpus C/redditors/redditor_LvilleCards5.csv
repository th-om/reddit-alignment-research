cvx1fek,0,t1_cvx16gq,LvilleCards5,"They're absolutely not -- and that's my point! 

Corporations aren't people, they're simply transfer entities. So any tax a corporation pays is simply paid by a combination of lower returns to its investors, lower pay to its workers, and higher prices to its consumers. And economic studies have shown that this incidence falls mostly on a company's workers, which is why most economists support lowering or eliminating corporate taxes. 

Which is why I said comparing a self-employed person's tax bill to a corporation is a bad a comparison -- because you're comparing a person to a transfer entity. It would be better to compare that person's tax bill to either a Facebook employee or shareholder if we wanted to make a point about how rich Facebook people don't pay enough in taxes.
