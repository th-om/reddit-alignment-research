You don't think you'd be able to tell the difference in someone's motives just from their body language and behavior, even with just a second's glace?

Go look at the video recordings we have of every active shooter. They walk around confident. They walk around because they know they're in control. They aren't going to be hiding behind trash cans and shit.

Rule 4: Be aware of your target and what is beyond it.

Not only do I think the odds of any sort of confusion you describe to be so low as to be ridiculous, but the tradeoff we're talking about is retarded. You'd rather a bunch of people get massacred and the shooter be left completely unopposed because there's a 1% of 1% chance that a would-be hero accidentally gets shot by the cops?

I mean, really, if the cops are there, the concealed carry guy doesn't need to be using his weapon. If the cops *aren't* there, there's no risk of the cops shooting him. Do you think he's going to shoot the gunman and then run around waving his gun in the air shooting at the ceiling in celebration?",0,0,1444694659,1444717608

Kenya allows concealed carry. Furthermore, if Kenya is anything like Nigeria, you can 'buy' a retroactive license from any cops who give you trouble.",19,0,1444693508,1444717608
