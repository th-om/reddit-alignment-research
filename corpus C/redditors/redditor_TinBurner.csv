cvwxpeq,0,t1_cvwsmn1,TinBurner,"Same. UK startup here. We paid about the same as them. Kinda feels unfair...

That said, I would prefer they reduce startup taxes and let Facebook do their thing.

The UK needs more companies (tech). Raising taxes on FB isn't the answer - it's reducing all the taxes for everyone else.

But damn, same as us.",2,0,1444660697,1444721581

cvrkq0x,0,t1_cvrezqn,TinBurner,"I slept with a girl in Miami in 2003. Unprotected while drunk.

The next day I flipped. I assumed I had any/all STD'd.

The next 6 months were hell. I couldn't eat, sleep, be social, etc... I developed OCD and became a germaphobe. I also went on medication for anxiety.

It f'd me up. 

It turned out I was clean, and so was she. But my god did I have phycological issues from it. 

I think it would be easy to get damages if what happens to them what happened to me.

Man, fuck this nurse.

cvp5naw,1,t3_3nl862,TinBurner,"Both feel a bit nebulas and broad. Not knowing what you do I still don't know what you do.

What is ""technologies?""

How do you use AI?

How do you empower?

What does ""incubate"" mean to the user?

What tools do you create?

How do your tools improve lives?

Personally, this feels very generic and like your team does not know it's mission, or have clearly understood your vision.

The Middle East is on the verge of a 1000 reprieve into history. Once oil is obsolete they have no natural resources to maintain themselves. It would be like fighting for alignment of Australia's counties in the middle of the continent.

The strategic value of the Middle East is passing us by. Israel may be a counter argument, but they need to defend themselves.",3,0,1443652273,1444721581
cvjub7j,1,t3_3myxq0,TinBurner,"I think its a great move for the USA. A bad one for Russia.

If you think in terms of 10 year plans, the USA being out of the Middle East would be in a better spot than Russia being in the Middle East for 10 years.

If they want the terrorism they can have it.

With that, I prefer the USA and Russia put away their dicks and play nice. We both leave the Middle East to sort out their internal and externally created problems by themselves.

Per the oil, who cares? Let them have political or forceful control of 6/6 of the oil and land. If we think on a 10 year plan, would investing in oil or other (nuclear, solar, wind, etc) be a better bet? I think the later.

Also on oil, I believe we get most (USA) our oil form Canada, internally, Saudi Arabia and then a few others under 5%.
