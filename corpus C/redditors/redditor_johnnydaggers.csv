cvwl36s,0,t1_cvqjeoo,johnnydaggers,"I'm one of those ""pessimistic"" engineers that he talks about in his video but there's a reason that people like me kept telling him that these ideas probably won't work: these solutions don't even survive back of the envelope calculations for feasibility. 

Graphene has high thermal conductivity because of the strength of its covalent bonds and high electron mobility, but its mechanical properties are abysmal. That cable would be very brittle and incredibly expensive to manufacture. 

Their distillation machine takes in sea water, boils it, and then pumps out the high-salinity brine as waste. If they took just 10 minutes to read the wikipedia article on [corrosion] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion) they would realize how big of a problem they would have on their hands keeping these things in working condition. Also, they propose to put the machines inside the barge below the water level so that the seawater would ""flow"" in and they wouldn't have to waste energy to pump it up to the top of the ship. They then go on to say that they would pump the distilled water via floating pipe to where it was needed. How does it make sense to pump water ten kilometers to shore when it doesn't make sense to pump it a few meters up to the deck of the ship?",2,0,1444621837,1444723534

The reason you are here is for the critical thinking skills you are developing during the gladiatorial process that is engineering education at Berkeley, which you get whether you are top of your class or not (as long as you work hard.) Don't put your self-worth on your GPA because it's not an accurate indicator of your potential or abilities. Please don't harm yourself. I've been at Cal for 4 years and I went through what you're going through the first semester of my junior year. If you want, I'll buy you a coffee/hot chocolate and we can talk about it. Just PM me.
