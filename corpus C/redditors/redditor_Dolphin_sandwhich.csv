cvw99wl,0,t1_cvw8foq,Dolphin_sandwhich,"Nobody ever said it would be easy, but that was not in question. I am not completely knowledgeable on the subject so if you have any evidence otherwise you can let me know. But from my understanding, the problem is that we are not doing anything about it other than militarizing our police force. 


We already know that the [murder rate increases in the states with existing right-to-carry laws](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/november/donohue-guns-study-111414.html). 

We know that there is [states with higher levels of gun ownership have disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm-related homicides](http://www.livescience.com/39754-states-with-more-guns-have-more-homicides.html). 

I feel that the problem is that there is [no survey at the state level that measures gun ownership](https://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news-media-law/news-media-and-law-winter-2013/chart-gun-permit-data-acces). We don't have to outright ban guns, they just need to be regulated better.",1,0,1444600585,1444730402
cvw5903,1,t3_3obgor,Dolphin_sandwhich,"I am not sure how well I can answer the question but I'll take a stab. I have met many foreigners across the world who are very afraid of coming to united states. They fear that coming to united states puts them at risk similar to that of coming to Mexico. It is recognized that gun violence is the [highest among all of the industrialized world](http://www.humanosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Graph-1.png). So people believe it is a national embarrassment to have such a high homicide rate when we could tightly regulate guns like the UK has.

You argue that we can spend our time and money on other things. Even if we lowered car accident deaths we would still have the media outlets projecting fear that we might get killed walking to our lecture in university. As long as the news feel that one type of death is worse than another then they will talk about it more often. If nothing is done about it the worse it will become.",2,0,1444594251,1444730402
