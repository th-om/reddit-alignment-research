cvxloea,0,t1_cvx3qiu,ImAnIdeaMan,Literally not a single person WANTS abortions. They just respect that other people may have different value systems and beliefs and let people chose for themselves.,2,0,1444697392,1444725062
cvxlmzi,0,t1_cvxjgfo,ImAnIdeaMan,"> It is absolutely no business of any man or indeed any religious or non medical professional. Frankly unless you are a woman and have been through the decision yourself I think you have no say whatsoever. 

A) A lot of women are anti-choice as well. and B) You don't think the father should have any say it in? It affects the father just as much as the mother.",0,0,1444697329,1444725062

cvxljii,0,t1_cvx0og0,ImAnIdeaMan,"> I am somewhat amused that those who support the right to end life are also so very offended by gun deaths.

But not amused by the people who are die hard gun fanatics who don't think there should be a single form of gun control but think that abortion is murder? I find that much more strange. Or people who are anti abortion and also unwilling to help people get birth control which would reduce the number of abortions.",0,0,1444697181,1444725062
cvxlflo,0,t1_cvx2g1p,ImAnIdeaMan,"How do you define a distinct life? If life begins IMMEDIATELY at conception you're defining a cell as a life. If so your skin cells are a distinct life too and even piece of dust is homicide but no one mentions that genocide going on. Is each sperm a distinct life? How many trillions of those have been killed just in the past 24 hours? Eggs? A lot of those are being mass-murdered as well. Your body is just a collection of ""distinct"" living cells working together so saying that a life begins IMMEDIATELY at conception may technically be true, but there are millions if not billions of other ""distinct"" lives in your body as well.

Maybe a better definition is if the ""distinct life"" if sentient or conscious. Or maybe whether it can survive independently of it's host/mother.

I'm not saying what the answer is, but I'm offering you thoughts to think maybe a little more deeply on the matter.",-1,0,1444697012,1444725062

Whether taxes should be progressive or flat? Way to much thought for the common person. It requires complex logic.,2,0,1444696393,1444725062
cvr61px,0,t1_cvqw6nd,ImAnIdeaMan,"Sometimes there are things we need to do as a society not for the benefit of people tomorrow or even ten years from now but 100 years from now. If we banned gun sales today (yes I know it's politically unfeasible and will likely never happen, but this is my argument) then people will still have guns tomorrow and a few years from now and we'll still face tragedies and mass shootings. However people won't be able to buy new guns and old ones won't last forever. Then, perhaps in 100 years the problem we won't be running into this shit all the time and guns won't be so prevalent in our society.

It's really the only actual *solution* I see to stop these mass shootings from happening. We can do background checks and make our mental health system better but psychos will still slip through the cracks and children will still get shot because they went to school that day.

At least that's the way I see it.",1,0,1444219027,1444725062

It's ridiculous that they even tested that, no one would need a test to know that. And where are the AWD car with winter tire vs F/RWD with winter tires handling/etc comparisons that would ACTUALLY tell us something?",0,0,1443473267,1444725062
