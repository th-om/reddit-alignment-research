cvxdosg,0,t1_cvxav2g,BitcoinPatriot,"Oh but there is where you are wrong. The Republicans CAN do something about both. Abortion is the intentional killing of a baby and now with technology and modern medicine a baby can be a viable living baby in as short as 23 weeks. 20% to 30% of 23 week old babies can survive and yet we allow abortions past that. Also, with technology we can see formed babies with hearts beating in as short as 6 weeks. This is information they didn't have in the early 70's and with a conservative president and Congress can pass severe restrictions on the murder of babies.

Regarding gay marriage the Supreme Court CANNOT write laws. They can only determine the laws written as legal or not. They determined that the definition of marriage was illegal. Bad decision but is the decision nonetheless. However, marriage has STILL not been defined!! So a law must be passed since the existing law no longer exists. With a Republican president and Congress that definition CAN be written as between a man and a woman and would take years to get back to the Supreme Court. By then all we need is one of the court justices that DOESN'T support the Constitution (like Ruth Bader Ginsburg) to retire or ""pass on"" and the Republican president and Congress nominate someone that DOES follow the Constitution and there is a 5 to 4 allowing marriage between a man and a woman.

So both problems of abortion and gay marriage can be correctly resolved.",-23,0,1444684694,1444731494
cvxd9xk,1,t3_3ohrda,BitcoinPatriot,"Understand that the Supreme Court cannot write law. All they can do is determine if a law is legal or not. Well the Supreme Court overruled a law. However, they cannot legally DETERMINE that gay marriage is legal they can only determine that a law DEFINING marriage was illegal.

That means a law still must be written defining marriage which means the next president and Congress have the ability to pass a new law defining marriage. Now THAT might ALSO be disputed and get BACK to the Supreme Court but by then there COULD be a change in the Supreme Court members.

So this election is VERY important for those that believe that marriage is as it has always been understood between a man and a woman.",-7,0,1444684094,1444731494
cvxaxz9,1,t3_3ohnkr,BitcoinPatriot,I bought one of your smaller cannons earlier this year and love it!! When I heard you had a 1/10th scale I thought AWESOME!! Certainly worth it but just don't have enough quarters right now:) But will certainly keep your website bookmarked!! A 1/10th scale would look AWESOME next to my collection of other (working and not working) replica cannons:),5,0,1444680818,1444731494

cvxa8eh,1,t3_3oex85,BitcoinPatriot,"Always have at least a Bill of Sale at the same time you sign over title so you have a receipt. Then if the government comes knocking you have the name and address of the person who bought it AND their signature.

BTW, the government is cracking down BIG TIME on cars being donated. So many donate a car worth a couple hundred, claim it is worth a couple thousand and make hundreds more on the deal in tax deductions. So now that is much harder to do and still claim without documentation of its value.",0,0,1444679796,1444731494
cvx9y8k,1,t3_3odyfi,BitcoinPatriot,"In my opinion a gun without a round in the chamber is a paperweight. In the rare occasion it is needed I don't think the assailant will hesitate to give you another couple seconds to chamber a round. Plus in the confusion to chamber a round you could drop the gun, not chamber fully so the round is not set, you could be attacked first and one arm has been injured and now CAN'T chamber a round, or a number of other reasons.

When my children were smaller I taught them not to touch guns but we also went to the range and I was letting my kids shoot as young as 4 or 5 years old.

Back to the story. But since I DID have kids in the house my gun (a small pocket .380) was ALWAYS in a pocket holster covering the trigger and always in my pocket. I NEVER laid it on the counter (which I do now that my only child still living at home is 25) and if it wasn't in my pocket was then in my small easy access gun safe by the bed. But my gun is either in my gun safe in my truck (when I can't carry while I work or my second job teaching at a public college), is between the seats in my truck while I am in the truck, OR is in my pocket (or if watching tv is on the end table next to me). When I go to bed it is on the shelf on the headboard right above my head for easy access if needed and the next morning goes right back into my pocket.

Except while at work or on campus at public college my gun always has a round in the chamber and is within arms reach.",-2,0,1444679403,1444731494
cvx9kje,1,t3_3odtbn,BitcoinPatriot,"Why would you want gun control? Over the last 20 years gun ownership has increased significantly and crime has dropped significantly. Today we have much smaller percentages of gun crimes because more law abiding citizens own guns.

Besides the fact that the Constitution guarantees the right to own a firearm and the founding fathers thought it critical that the individual has the ability to protect themselves the statistics also show that as more law abiding own guns the less crime we have as well.",0,0,1444678853,1444731494
cvx946t,1,t3_3ofu6h,BitcoinPatriot,"A gun is a tool that is used for sport, hunt, and if necessary to protect a person and/or their family.

That a statistically minimal number of people use the tool illegally and irresponsibly and cause injury or death is no reason to restrict its use by the other 99.9% of gun owners.

That is like saying because there was a drunk driver that caused an accident and killed a family last night we should remove automobiles from all other law abiding citizens. Or because a child had drowned due to their parents not watching them we should ban swimming pools. Or because a person injured themselves with a circular saw we should ban circular saws.

No, in the U.S. we believe (and is IN the Constitution) that a person who is responsible and law-abiding should be allowed to own a firearm. What we SHOULD do is enforce the laws we already have. That the government does not enforce the laws and/or make the penalties for using a gun in a crime much more severe is the problem.

BTW, more people are injured or die in automobile accidents than those harmed or killed with a gun yet we have more guns in this country than automobiles.",0,0,1444678216,1444731494
cvx8usu,1,t3_3of15u,BitcoinPatriot,Statistically you have a better chance of getting in a car accident than getting injured by a gun. So by your logic we should outlaw automobiles?,-1,0,1444677837,1444731494
cvx6k8k,1,t3_3ogfg8,BitcoinPatriot,"I continue to pick up great deals. I got to know my local FFL pretty good (a pawn shop) and he will actually let me know when he gets something in he thinks I might be interested in. Of course he is buying from desperate people who need money and buys for half its value or less. Then he calls me or sends me an email if it is something I might be interested in and offers to sell to me for about 70% to 75% of its current used gun value. Great deal for him because he flips it quickly and great deal for me because I buy a gun I have always wanted, get to shoot it a few times, and if I like it I keep it and if I don't like it (or don't need it) then a couple months later might list on Armslist for about 90% of its value so sell it very quick and make a few bucks as well.

I think I have bought somewhere about 20 guns from this pawn shop in the last 2 years. Couple that come to mind is I bought a Mossberg Persuader in excellent condition for $200 and bought a Marlin 795 .22 rifle for $90.",1,0,1444674521,1444731494
