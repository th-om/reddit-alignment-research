cvxv04q,0,t1_cvxetoj,lotu,"I think annual lotteries have a ""moral"" advantage over semi-weekly our continuous lotteries (like scratch offs).  The annual lottery has much less potential for addiction because it is hard to get addicted to an event that happens once year.  Also because it is a tradition I strongly suspect you get a more balanced group of people.  People that normally would not play the lottery are more likely to play.",1,1,1444713751,1444727596

cvwkbfv,0,t1_cvvgpes,lotu,Last I checked low end exploitive companies like McDonalds and Walmart don't pay their employees in stock.  It is the large tech companies that also provide their employees with back massages and stuff the pay their employees in stocks.  In fact I would say paying you employess in stock probably shrinks the wealth gap if anything.  Though you can only afford to get payed in a risky instrument like stocks if you are reality well off.,1,0,1444620406,1444727596

Our needs and wants are ever changing, just 30 years ago a mobile phone was an extravagant luxury, today it is a necessity probably just below clothing and food.",1,0,1444530144,1444727596
cvveqf0,0,t1_cvv8byw,lotu,"Because many things rely not simply having enough stuff.  For example real estate in Manhattan cannot be replicated in because if you do you have to put it some place else where it will by definition not be in Manhattan.  I also strongly doubt we will have unlimited matter replication like in Star Trek, I just don't think the energy requirements are realistic.  ",2,0,1444529913,1444727596
cvv5f64,0,t1_cvv525i,lotu,"It is not just, not profitable, there are people actively working against providing basic human needs to everyone.  Your local ~~African~~ warlord realizes that he can pay his soldiers in food only if everyone else is starving. As such he is likely to kill anyone who comes around trying to solve the famine he created.  

Edit: /u/edashotcousin bellow was right about my using ""African"" it is needlessly decisive and doesn't ad to my point in anyway while suggesting both that *all* of African is lawless and that this doesn't happen in places outside of Africa.",22,0,1444512397,1444727596
