cvjs5u1,1,t3_3n086k,ShelledThrower2,"May bought porn on a county credit card with tax payer money while on vacation in Hawaii, also paid for by taxpayers. Lies about it. Backtracks. Finally admits it like it's nothing.  Then he has the audacity to stand on stage and call the Bowers 'salacious?' What a hypocrite. He was squirming like a snake on that stage. May didn't like what he got and now the leadership doesn't want to face the facts. May has a job to keep. Can't get any better than this job with a divinity degree.

Bowers has his problems, but trying to discredit a former Attorney General generally isn't the smartest idea... 

May's done for. 


Edit: Let's also not forget the meeting Bowers was thrown out of in August when May was unveiling the new (and controversial) stadium deal.  Bowers showed up to deliver his reports and was told to leave by May's assistant. It's so simple to see, but May just can't face the facts.",14,0,1443648558,1444730846
cvirqnv,0,t1_cvi7b31,ShelledThrower2,"I would still go with Vardy. However, I will note that Ighalo has been playing the more forward of the two strikers. Denney looks to have slipped into the number 10 roll for the past few games. I've had Ighalo and have been happy with his returns, but Vardy is in a bit better form on a bit better team.

Gomis has been playing well but the possibility for him to only see 60 minutes, or even less, which makes me nervous.

Vardy is hot but they do have a series of united, swansea, chelsea, everton.",1,0,1443573824,1444730846
