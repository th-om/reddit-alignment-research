cvx4w3o,0,t1_cvx3hzd,zimm0who0net,"There are algorithms that do this, and they do get used (at least as a starting point) by districting commissions. The rub is what ""values"" get baked into the algorithm. For example, some try to balance distribution of voters. However, it doesn't take a math major to figure out that in a state with a 5% Republican advantage, districting with an equal proportion means that each district has a 5% republican advantage, and thus 100% of the districts will tend to go Republican. Some states try to do things like create ""majority minority"" districts thinking that Rep ends up speaking out for minority interests. That tends to create a district where the incumbent wins in 2-1 lopsided majorities and is hyper-partisan (generally what the article was about). It also pulls minorities out of the other districts which means the other reps will be less responsive to minority issues.
