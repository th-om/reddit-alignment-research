cvqhbtk,0,t1_cvqd4zo,jakizely,"Veteran suicide is a problem.  However, that wasn't the problem here, and taking guns away won't help.  Here's why.

Being in the service, there is a lot asked from you with little resources.  If you are going to commit suicide, there are a ton of ways to do it.  Even on the civilian side, suicide without a gun is very attainable.  Just ask Japan.",2,0,1444162342,1444724532

cvplljk,0,t1_cvplalh,jakizely,"The thing is, registration alone wouldn't really work.  You could just say that you lost the gun, or it was a private sale, it was stolen.....  

They have put forward ideas of having bullet serialized, or have the firing pin put a stamp on the casings, but the first would not work at all, and there are easy ways around the other two.  I feel that we need to focus on the reason why we have violence, and not how violence is committed.  But that is a much harder issue to tackle, and much less tangible.  I feel like guns are an easy target so that politicians can say ""see I did something"", without actually solving a problem.  I live in Maryland, and they passed a ""Safety Act"" which arbitrarily banned a whole slew of firearms (ones no more ""deadly"" than the last) and put a bunch of other random requirements in play.  Murders have gone up, two years in a row.  We already passed last years number back in early September.",1,0,1444094537,1444724532
cvpl4qc,0,t1_cvpdh5a,jakizely,"I'm OK with background checks, but the thing people are afraid of is the registration part.  NY and CT used that to try to take away firearms from previous purchases.  The gun was no more lethal, the owners not dangerous.  They took away firearms from a vet who was having trouble sleeping.  People always laugh at the ""but that damn skunk Muslim is comin' fee mer gurns!"".  I usually laugh at the really paranoid ones, but it has happened.  

What we need is a system that just takes in your info, long enough to do a check and then dumps it completely.  Make sure there are ways to differentiate between some "" mental disorder "" like insomnia and mental instability.  Also, stop using just any felony as a reason to deny a right.  Especially since we criminalize every damn action in this country, and have wonderful mandatory minimums.  Make the line violence.

As others have said, improve and increase care for the mentally ill.  Even if it doesn't help with gun violence, its still a huge problem and is a damn good idea. ",5,0,1444093746,1444724532

As for your co-worker, that sounds super shady, especially if it crossed state lines.",2,0,1443899670,1444724532

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/whos-to-blame-for-sub-accident/

I got to work with someone who was on the sub at the time of the impact.  He said that they had no idea how bad the damage was until they got back into port and were amazed that they made it.  He said it was a testament to how well they are built.  He also mentioned that they were cleaning up blood for months after the event.  Not that it was continuous, just that as they were doing something else, they would then find more blood.  Pretty intense. ",5,0,1443899449,1444724532
