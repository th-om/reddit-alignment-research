The great famine ended in 1961. By 1979 when the 1C policy was enacted, death rates had dropped to 7/1000 (same as today and therefore suggest little fear of food shortage), and birth rates had already dropped from 50/1000 to 21/1000 (today 12). Only then was the policy enacted, and not because of a food shortage, but because the party thought that they could affect global overpopulation aggressively, and, I argue, without consequences. 

If we were to play the game of weighing pros and cons, don't forget about infanticide, forced abortions, jailing mothers, 117 boys for every 100 girls, 4-2-1 syndrome, and a perfect storm of welfare collapse on the horizon. And the pros? Because they wanted to cure starvation problems that were by then minimal? Nope. Because their solution of overpopulation fears was short-sighted and carried out with an axe instead of a scalpel. ",1,0,1443489556,1444726988
