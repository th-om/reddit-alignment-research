cvxqmbz,0,t1_cvxq4r8,MRMiller96,I had them bring me a few extra pieces because they were ridiculously thin. They agreed and didn't charge me for them.,2,0,1444705061,1444726444
cvxp9uu,0,t1_cvxk0j7,MRMiller96,"You're not wrong, psychologically speaking, however, scientists do it all the time. I don't see anyone pushing Aether theory. It's not impossible, it just takes a different mindset, based on the idea that ""what I know might be wrong."" rather than the initial assumption that ""what I know must be right."" That type of thinking is learned more than innate.",1,0,1444702932,1444726444
cvxozbw,0,t1_cvxg3p8,MRMiller96,"There was a weird idea being spread around by a bunch of uneducated people making assumptions that became super popular in the 80's about a deity or entity called ""Sam Hain""; However, the word Samhain is not pronounced ""Sam-Hain"" it's pronounced closer to 'Sow-en' and is the name of the festival itself and not any particular entity.

It's actually pretty silly. It would be like spreading the idea of an entity named ""Chris Timmas"" or ""Passo Verr"".",1,0,1444702488,1444726444
cvxojuk,0,t1_cvwzb8b,MRMiller96,"The ""Satanic Panic"" in the 80's-early 90's caused a lot of schools in bible-belt areas to stop Halloween celebrations for a while. It was ridiculously stupid and an overreaction to nonsense that only took a fun seasonal celebration that all kids look forward to and made it out to be something horrible and evil. It eventually subsided, but Halloween has changed a lot because of it. Kids used to trick or treat from just before sundown to 10pm or later, until the majority of porch lights were off, and now they trick or treat from 5pm on and generally it dies off between sunset and a few hours after, depending on the area.

It's always been my favorite holiday, but really it's kind of a shell of what it was in the early 80's. People used to put a lot of thought and work into their costumes every year, but now it's not much more than a parade of identical cheap pop-culture walmart costumes.",2,0,1444701801,1444726444
cvx5imc,1,t3_3ogrig,MRMiller96,"I've noticed over the past 5 years whenever I get breakfast at a restaurant, the bacon has gotten thinner and thinner. I had breakfast at a local diner the other day and the bacon was thinner than paper and I could barely taste it.",15,0,1444673019,1444726444
cvx4udf,1,t3_3ogbt2,MRMiller96,Sounds like he's worrying about democrats using filibuster as much as the republicans have and wants to prevent that.,6,0,1444672052,1444726444
cvx1yqe,1,t3_3ogqem,MRMiller96,"There's a couple in Hook, but the one I remember most is when Smee throws the baseball to Jack, The ball is supposed to have a smoke trail after he hits it, but the smoke trail appears after the pitch instead.",1,0,1444667754,1444726444
cvvehpo,0,t1_cvvabzq,MRMiller96,"I understand that it isn't a rubber sheet sheet (I was a physics major in college 15 years ago) but the capability to deform would still imply some sort of elasticity (literally the 'ability to stretch, bend, expand or deform') so the term works for the purpose of my question.

>Space can 'deform' in essentially any way the physics tells it to, there isn't a penalty for too much or too little stretching or bending.

So essentially infinitely elastic.",0,0,1444529462,1444726444
