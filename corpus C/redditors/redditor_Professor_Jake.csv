>In other words, it's not a price control in the sense that the government is setting a price ceiling, but rather a price control in that the government wants to lower the price floor they've set. The equilibrium pre-regulation price remains much lower than the actual post-regulation price.

This doesn't make any sense.  Can you rephrase this please?

The same price control economics that discourage new development in NYC (*which they ""solved"" by demanding that all new development have low income housing included because of their price control failure results*) will discourage development of new drugs.

>However, what we usually don't do is set prices. Perhaps most importantly, setting prices as opposed to subsidizing is more inflexible than the market may require. If manufacturers have capped prices they can't as easily weather supply chain problems, and are not incentivized to provide for multiple segments of the market.

The point is usually.  Which is dependent on the situation for the public interest (*regardless if it is long term damaging such as rent control*).  If we were to keep that view and apply it more universally, the drug market wouldn't have price controls as we would want to prevent damaging policies that would limit future investment and progression in the field. 

Its a discussion of the politics of public good - price controls for drugs vs other products such as those that impact public safety and health.   

>Anyway, despite my efforts and those of some others here, you're likely to get far better and more complete discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of a planned or command economy and when they apply by using Google than Reddit.

I already stated at the beginning that the economics are clear, its not a discussion on economics.  Again, its a discussion of the politics of public good - price controls for drugs vs other products such as those that impact public safety and health. ",1,0,1443637370,1444722246

First, your uncivil comment is not welcome here.  At all.  Reform or leave, this isn't /r/politics where the lowest form of discussions is appreciated. 

>What do you think would happen to tesla if you cut the price of their cars in half or by two thirds?

I already stated the economics are clear.   For consumers, it would be a surge of demand while suppliers (Telsa) would be unwilling to produce at that level.   But that doesn't matter with price controls and forced sales, their recouping of the investment isn't a factor. ",1,0,1443632650,1444722246

The drug Daraprim is a version of a Pyrimethamine. The same thing can be done, less efficiently but still done, by a Pyrimethamine- Sulfadoxine combination drug where there are 46 generics out. 

But that also ignores the obvious fact that you made it economically unsuitable to invest to cure/treat diseases that do not already have another drug.  Because if you declare that unless it has competition there are price controls, you told everyone that they shouldn't research anything too new or they will be punished.
