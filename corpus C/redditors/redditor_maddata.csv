It's gotten more popular, which means more of the mainstream reddit opinion leaks in, instead of being dominated by ausensieter people who can't constructively discuss/communicate in the major politics subreddits.

I'm experimenting with maxing out authority to provide greater social unrest, since I'm using them with spies to try and incite revolts.  Main reason I need to do that is I took 4 cities from the arverni too quickly and then they just walked over the 2 rearmost cities retaking them and then stomped through (ungarrisoned because I was on offense) Italia taking 2 more settlements.

cvxdpt2,0,t1_cvxa2jc,maddata,"First off I was using 2015 data not 2011, so naturally there should be some discrepancy between 2015, and your 2011 data.  Still, the value you're quoting has taken income taxes paid and divided by all income *plus* government and employer benefits.  I was talking about the actual income tax rate, not a statistic manufactured by a left-leaning think tank which has aggregated the data just right.  For what it's worth, I could have quoted the similarly named right-leaning ""Tax Foundation"" for their opinion.  I have *no idea* how to find the same data for Norway, so there's no way to compare your figure to Norway, which was my example.  For all we know, Norway's effective rate was 5%.  I'm comparing two apples, and you're handing me an orange.

What we do know is that the top us rate is 39.6% and the top rate in Norway is 34.7%.  We also know that Norway places its tax burden more evenly across earners, while the United States uses a more progressive approach.

Again for corporate taxes, I was comparing two of the same statistics: 2015 tax rates.  You can't compare US effective corporate tax rate to Norwegian statutory tax rate.  In any case, in *Global Effective Tax Rate Comparisons—Methodology and Results*, PWC puts the *effective* US corporate tax rate at 17th highest in the world in 2009, *higher* than Norway.  IFS put the base case effective USA marginal corporate tax rate in 2005 at 24% compared to Norway's 22%.  Finally, the last source on that table I investigated, *Report Card on Effective Corporate Tax Rates*, concluded:  

> The United States’ top statutory tax rates will soon be the highest in the OECD, and the US effective average and effective marginal tax rates are far above the OECD average. Any effort at corporate tax reform is therefore incomplete without a push toward addressing not only the high statutory rates, but also the relatively high effective average and marginal rates.

> By our calculation, the US statutory rate is nearly 10 percentage points higher than the effective average rate and nearly 17 percentage points higher than the effective marginal tax rate. Relative to other OECD countries, the United States is one of the worst performers on this score. 

I have *no idea* how your source used data, that in their original publication were used to conclude that the effective tax rate in the US was high, to build a chart that suggests the opposite, but there it is.

Anyways, looks like I should have been using effective tax rates to make my point?  I was using statutory rates because that information is accessible and not exactly easy to 'doctor' up or dispute.  I didn't want to dig into contestable analysis.

I think it's clear that the highest personal income taxes are higher in the US than in Norway, that US income taxes are administered in a more progressive way than in Norway, and that corporate taxes (effective and statutory) are higher in the US than in Norway.

If we accept that Bernie Sanders wants to increase personal income taxes (especially the highest brackets), wants to increase the progressiveness of the income taxes, and wants to increase corporate taxes, then Bernie Sanders' ideas are a further departure from the ""Nordic Model"", and not an example of fiscal policy that has works ""everywhere else"".

Side note thanks for the discussion, I had to do some research to support my position, and read your sources to try and find chinks in the armor.  Disagreeing with people is usually the best way to test and strengthen your own opinions, regardless of whether anyone changes their mind or not.",2,0,1444684735,1444716270
cvxa6ct,1,t3_3ohmad,maddata,"Wealth is arbitrary to some extent, and depending on the commodity can fluctuate a lot.

Who is going to pay for the army of appraisers that would be necessary to verify that the value of a house is reported correctly, or the value of a car is reported correctly, or any number of other possessions... not to mention the fringe one-of-a-kind items that a truly wealthy person might own (things that nowadays are sold once every two decades at undisclosed prices).

Income is *way* easier.

Another reason is that savings is pretty good for the economy, so taxing on pure savings is not necessarily a good pressure to put on people's decision making.

We already tax capital gains, so investment savings are already discouraged through taxation, and in effect a bit of a 'wealth tax'.

A question to shoot back:

Why don't we simply tax on yearly *expenditure* instead of income?",10,0,1444679717,1444716270

The native Americans were already decimated by decades of disease, some estimates place NA native populations at around 10% of pre-columbian exchange levels.  In any case, conflict with natives isn't exactly a cushy luxury, I don't see how waging a war / defending a foothold isn't 'rugged or individualistic'.

Some of these colonies had no contact with Europe for *years*.  Some of these colonists had to resort to cannibalism.  Granted, it takes at least two people in order for cannibalism to exist, so by your definitions I guess that it's not individualistic enough.
