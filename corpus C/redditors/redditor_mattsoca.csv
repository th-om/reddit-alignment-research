cvwtjc2,0,t1_cvwhjx9,mattsoca,"Yes, but look at it a different way:  the Twins are building a team that they expect to make the playoffs and hopefully go deep in those playoffs in a few short years.  When that window opens, where will Mayer's level of play be?  In the meantime, he is getting in the way of other players getting time and progressing on that same playoff arc.  On a similar note, this is why I put an off-season catcher acquisition as a top priority: you need someone that's going to be good in a couple of seasons and Suzuki's play is also declining.",1,0,1444650453,1444725653

Interesting to note that there were allegations of voting machine rigging in the swing state of Ohio for the 2004 presidential election.

cvsftbn,1,t3_3nxl5l,mattsoca,"Wow.  I know it's pre-season game 1 - and this is just the highlights, but those offensive moves look like he's been playing pro-ball for about a decade.  Head fakes, pull ups, step backs.  Damn.  Let's hope he stays healthy.",3,0,1444310957,1444725653
cvsfj07,1,t3_3nx1cn,mattsoca,"Time for  frank discussions with your wife.  Lay yourself out.  Tell her flat out that you are insecure and start discussing the reasons why.  She's your wife -- your partner.  She should be there to help you through this.  Some of your feelings and thoughts might be irrational.  Some might not.  Is more communication necessary?  Are you missing some more quality time together?  Life can get hectic and it's important to make time to just be together.  This can be a stepping stone to build upon.  Hopefully this embarrassing moment isn't something to beat you down about ""mistrust"" with and is just an embarrassing moment.  Marriage isn't easy and there are sometimes my spouse just flat-out-pisses me off (and I'm sure I do the same to her from time to time (although rare ;)).  I still love her and cherish her and look forward to every moment I get to spend with her.  We just celebrated our 19th anniversary a few days ago.  Best wishes to you both!!",7,0,1444310392,1444725653
