I said that MLK wasn't spending time giving puff piece interviews where he would state his favorite food. Of course he would eat in front of people, where in the world would you get that from? Of course he would talk to people about it. But we don't have a statement from him as to what his favorite food was. When you look it up, it's all random stereotypical Southern food. Nothing concrete, everything has been filtered through hearsay. ",1,0,1444577494,1444729908
