The problem is that the anit-gun group don't actually know anything about guns and try to put policies in place that dont make sense. ",6,0,1444041179,1444723454
cvm7ls5,1,t3_3na3zj,Jojoweiner,My medical school allows concealed carry as does the undergrad campus.  We also have very low crime stats and there hasn't been one incidence involving a student with a gun that I can find.  I've been carrying to school for 2 years now without a problem.  I'm not sure if concealed carry makes our campus safer or is the reason for our low crime stats but being able to carry make me feel like I can at least protect myself and others if necessary.  I would imagine also this policy makes it less likely for someone to target our school knowing they will likely be confronted with armed students and faculty.   ,1,0,1443825449,1444723454

Also, Obama inviting him to the white house to see his ""clock"" is ridiculous.  If I showed up to the north lawn at the white house with that same clock in a briefcase, what do you think would happen to me?",4,0,1442937230,1444723454
