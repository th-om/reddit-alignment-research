cvwvdsu,0,t1_cvwowo6,Zetesofos,"For glory-yeah, ill adjust the wording.

Perfect form - perhaps. Ill change it to being able to take one additional stance reaction only.

Withstand. Will switch with adaptaive defense",1,0,1444655859,1444721559
cvwvc8w,0,t1_cvwmicl,Zetesofos,"Thanks. Truthfully i wasnt thinking of the old prestige class when i made it. More, i started with trying to make a fighter that could stop spell casters, then added the hunter ranger type format after the. Inital design seemed to narrow.

As for paragon, i was trying to find something between champion and battlemaster for complexity.",1,0,1444655757,1444721559
cvwvafj,0,t1_cvwnvjf,Zetesofos,"Yeah, you`re right. Ill update soon. Good catch.",1,0,1444655630,1444721559
cvwkg06,0,t1_cvwk7ts,Zetesofos,"Oh, my bad - it's 10+ cha temporary hit points (updated)

As for perfect form - not sure best how to word it, but idea is that you can take up to two reactions in a round

cvmplsd,1,t3_3nb62g,Zetesofos,"I would have phrased it similiar to the battlemaster power ""If that attack would hit the second creature's AC, it also takes damage..."" just so this can't be gamed in such a way is to allow you to hit a hard target easier.",1,0,1443879501,1444721559
cvlt6in,1,t3_3n7hto,Zetesofos,"I've been debating instituting some sort of point system for rests.  Players get rest points based upon character actions (drinking, eating, sleeping in an inn vs out in a tent, some magical items, etc). Then, during a set amount of downtime (1 hour for short rest, 8 for long), you can spend X number of points to gain the benefit.  

For example, lets say that you get 1 rest point (RP) for eating a 1lb of food a day and drinking required water, 3 RP for sleeping under a common inn. You can spend 1 RP to gain the benefit of a short rest, or 8 for a long rest.  Under this formula, you'll probably be able to go 2 or 3 days before getting a long rest, assuming you take 3 to 4 short rests between.  

If the party takes their time to find a nice inn, then you force them to expend time and resources, but more importantly, it makes that choice have a bit more meaning as well.

Thoughts?",2,0,1443802882,1444721559
