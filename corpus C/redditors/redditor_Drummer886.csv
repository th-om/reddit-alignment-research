Interesting to check out how he plays just quarter notes behind George Colemans solo. Traditionalists would point to how ""simple is better"" but really (allegedly) he just hated George Coleman and thought he sucked and was pissed that he (gc) was on the gig. Then he just said ""fuck it"" and let Herbie and Ron finish the job. ",3,0,1434419661,1444727654
