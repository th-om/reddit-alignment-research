But IF they're level headed they'll understand that this kind of stuff happens.  But that the OP should have kept a better eye on their kid because preventing this crap, is the very reason why people hire babysitters to begin with.

Basically, children of that age do not understand or empathize with the pain of other living things.   I remember myself watching some fish that we kept in a bathtub (my dad just went fishing that day and caught them) all die when I emptied the water out of it. 

I didn't understand what I was doing at all and have memories of their gasping for air.  

My father took the ones that were still alive and saved them.
We later drove back out to the lake and I released them from shore - watched them swim away... afterwards he tried to explain some things to me about how they needed ""water air"" to live.

So if the parents are level headed they'll not make too much of a big deal.   But at the very least you'll never get to be around their child again (or their friends) Which is a really good thing for (the OP) IMO.

It's going to take more than a few minutes for a child to catch and kill the cat and we all know it.
So the OP should have been keeping a better eye on him vs talking on the phone or ""getting some water""  - you never leave the room with them alone.   ***Period.***",1,0,1444594300,1444728576

From a sociological point of view, the self division of a group of people into a closed on creates resentment. 

Add to that the prohibitions against intermarriage and you strengthen the discord and  objectification in the society.

They aren't fragile as long as their needs are met and can withstand quite a lot if they're in good shape to start with. 
A few days without water should not have caused your animal to die unless it was stressed to begin with.

Unfortunately, there's so much misinformation out there on the net that keeps getting passed around...  with predictable results. 

______________

Misters, waterfalls and even automatic drip systems don't work.. or are just a mess of problems. 

My advice is to take back that waterfall it's a joke. 
people that recommend it don't understand chameleons nearly as well as they think.  Those things are dead cricket, fecal traps and bacterial soup makers. 

The entire notion about a veiled or panther not drinking from sanding water is complete BS and it's based on a lack of understanding of how these animals ""see"" and what instinctively  triggers them to understand ""water"" for what it is.   Part of this is that there's a good deal of money being made from drippers, misters and monsoon devices, the other part is that chams to many are expensive bragging items and the more expensive equipment that's purchased to keep them alive ... the more exclusive they can be presented as to others. 

*Funny how they don't need all that stuff in the wild.*

First things  first let get a look at your current setup.
We'll also need to know what part of the world your in so we can get a good idea as to the ambient conditions you're dealing with. 

As Gary pointed out, we use drinking glasses here for hydration, the animals get 100% hydrated with all the water they want and it's easy to clean and setup.
While it's true that a glass can tip over (rarely happens if it's set up correctly) they're much cleaner and easily managed so that a cham can be left a weekend without any worries about it's drying out.

So lets get those images up so we can review them. ",2,0,1444588496,1444728576

As such the whole situation is a result of a long standing imbalance between the forces, the disruption of what is natural.  The choice that was made to attempt to standing strong and the use of force vs giving way and preservation. 

All are to blame here. 

By keeping themselves separate and divided from the rest of European society by language, custom and religious dictate of non intermarriage they opened the door for resentment by others.

For their part the rest of society found a easy target where accusations could easily be made, people objectified and made to be useful scapegoats.
