cvxshdx,1,t3_3ojho9,KevZero,Good for him. Terribly embarrassing incident and he'll rightly have to suffer the consequences (welcome to adulthood Luke!). But his apology is classy and I hope he means it when he says he plans to tackle the underlying issue.,0,0,1444708217,1444727926
cvxs2rb,1,t3_3oj0mg,KevZero,"Oil plummeted earlier this year, which tanked one of our biggest industries and had knock-on effects (eg manufacturing and services related to the oil patch). Our dollar has declined significantly but that hasn't yet shown any increase in foreign demand for our (now cheaper) goods. Banks and many Canadian companies are facing a brutal thrashing if interest rates start moving up from their current historical lows. Somehow, real estate continues to trundle along. The wildcard is really whether international (mainly Chinese, but also, of course, American) demand (mainly for commodities) will kick our economy back up out of its current tailspin. Tech is doing fairly well and able to take advantage of a low loonie internationally.

Apologies for getting political, but some deficit spending such as one party has proposed could be just the thing to start pulling demand and generating a positive feedback loop in our economy. Investments that enhance our global competitiveness would be welcome right about now.",2,0,1444707506,1444727926

cvxph9o,0,t1_cvxlx37,KevZero,"I don't have too much other relevant experience to be honest: a bit of time with an old film slr back in the 90's; the only other dslr I owned was a pretty crappy old Olympus (was a great starter though!), and a few spins with my brother's Canon T3i. I was a bit jealous when I used the Canon at a concert as it did really well under low-light (especially the AF), but I realized that was mainly the lens and I have since gotten two much better lenses for concerts: the 50mm f/1.4 and the 85mm f/1.8. I also didn't like the Canon's controls or how it felt in my hands. Now, that could just be unfamiliarity, but my impression was that I still wouldn't like it as much as my Nikon if I spent more time with it.

Anyway, that's the best answer I can give to your question: the D7000 crushes everything else I've tried. But I don't think it adds much to your original dilemma.",1,0,1444703236,1444727926

cvx5hqj,1,t3_3oh7yn,KevZero,"I have a D7000 and I can tell you that the weather sealing has helped me feel more confident bringing my camera out in bad weather, to the beach and into the damp woods. The built-in AF motor has allowed me to buy an older model of tele lens that was both cheaper and better quality glass than the newer, comparable one with its own AF motor. And the D7000 has pretty awesome ISO performance, although I don't know how it compares to the other models. So, assuming the D7000 is in good shape, I'd go with that one, personally.
