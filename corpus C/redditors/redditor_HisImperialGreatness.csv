cvuk6es,0,t1_cvudx5y,HisImperialGreatness,">Capitalism is predicated on free trade and individual rights. You can't have it without those. You'll also notice that fascism precludes those things by means of a coercive state (not unlike socialism). 

No, all capitalism is private property. That's it, that's all there is to it.

>Yes. And with good reason. 

The only ""good reason"" you have is that it hurts your argument. Stop your infantile cries with this BS and give me sources, or I'm done here.",1,0,1444455587,1444716462
cvudszb,0,t1_cvua6zh,HisImperialGreatness,">Fascism requires state control over just about everything. Same as socialism. Capitalism would require that a large area be carved out for private property and individual rights- neither of which are tolerated under socialism/fascism. 

No, it doesn't. Fascism is inherently corporatism. It is a variant of capitalism.  Your ideology is not perfect in both theory and implementation.

>Compare South Korea and North Korea. Tell me whose more nationalistic.

During the 50's and 60's, I would definitely say South Korea.
