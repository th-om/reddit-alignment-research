Economics is a positive science. It studies the outcomes of certain events in the market. Policy is not a positive science. Policy is applying a set of values to the data economics provides. To say Bernie Sanders is insane ""because economics"" is lazy and untrue.

Also, Webb's my first choice so inb4 sanders circle jerk accusations

cvx4sse,0,t1_cvx33xr,NewWahoo,"Webb is far more pro gun than Sanders (who barely qualifies as pro gun in my book tbh). I'm hoping he takes the question head on and distinguishes himself from the rest instead of dodging or pandering to the anti-gun base.

It's not like he's got anything to loose. I'm just glad someone's an alternative to the typical liberal talking points.",2,0,1444671990,1444722487

cvww9dl,1,t3_3oepgd,NewWahoo,"Robert Byrd.

Obviously his views on race were/are deplorable, but he was a reminder to how much our country has changed. He served in the Senate with our first black president, the same senate chambers that he took part in the longest filibuster in senate history over the Civil Rights Act.

I also am always surprised to how long West Virginians voted Democrat for considering how much the party changed since the New Deal. I get that FDR did a lot to help them, but considering the evangelical population and mining industry I would have thought they would abandoned the party long ago. 

Byrd was also a huge opponent to the Iraq War and advocate for the working class and Labor. He also brought an unbelievable amount of Federal dollars back to the state. Their highway system is higher quality than our interstates!

I guess to sum up why I love learning about Byrd is that I agree with **so** much of what he stood for and understand exactly why West Virginia loved him, but at the same time I'm disgusted by what he did in the past. ",6,0,1444657845,1444722487
cvsy0cy,0,t1_cvs5g9y,NewWahoo,"I think these are pretty difficult to predict though. Redskins might have a pretty shitty special teams, but the chance for giving up a TD on a return is still pretty low. Same goes with having a punt blocked, snap fumbled, etc. 

I mean, if any team were to do it this week it would be us, but it's not like you can count on scoring on our special teams just because other teams have.

cvsv7ma,1,t3_3nzhpo,NewWahoo,"Topics that are important to me yet never get enough attention:

- Labor Rights and Unions

- NSA and Privacy Rights

- Environmental Protection **and** how to help communities that relay on fossil fuels (VA, KY, WV)

Topics that are important to me and I know they'll focus on

- Foreign Policy. Anything from TPP to the war in Syria. I think this will be the majority of time on stage

- Income Inequality. Sanders will call for $15 minimum wage, Clinton will tie it to the gender gap,  Webb will mumble about poor whites in Appalachia, O'Malley will be awkward. None of them are wrong, but its pretty predictable what they'll say.

What I **don't** want is for any of those two topics to devolve into the candidates ignoring what one is saying and sticking solely to their talking points. There's only 4 (5?) (was Chaffee invited?) so I hope there is some actual discussion of policy plans, how they're different, or how they'll reach the same goal differently. I also really could care less about the Emails at this point but I know they are going to ask about that.
