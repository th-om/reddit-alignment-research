Front he article you sent ""According to documents seen by the Associated Press, the UN has made a secret agreement with Tehran to uphold the conditions of the nuclear deal with the US and five other world powers in July.""  

Why the hell is this secret, and why is the left ok with key details being withheld from US citizens when we are suppose to be actually debating the merits of this deal.

The question non of you will answer is why should we trust Iran this much?  Why would the US push to have their own inspectors on the ground?  I mean if the US is actually focused on them not getting a bomb then we should demand that we get access to all their sites and have our own inspectors present.   Is it just you all trust everything Obama tells you?  I mean you are putting your faith in the hands of the UN, a notoriously corrupt institution.",-4,0,1442905355,1444725573

cv9twvf,1,t3_3lw24r,Sluuha,"""It sounds like a pretty good deal to me. Iran's nuclear capabilities are essentially crippled to the point that all they can do is a little bit of non-military research for 10 or 15 years, the UN has unrestricted inspection privileges, and some of the trading sanctions on Iran are lifted to hopefully allow them to grow their economy and avoid any further unrest among the populace.

This is what pisses me off about people who support the deal.  They clear spent no time looking into how it actually works.  Currently we do not have unrestricted access.  Additionally it seems that Iran will be able to check and report on stuff itself.  Lastly we never actually got to even confirm where they were starting from.  I mean seriously do some basic research before you go pushing these lies about the deal.  Lastly the left is totally ok just opening the flood gates of cash to a country that we know sponsors terrorism and all fro some promises from a country that has never proven trustworthy.  Here's a news flash when a politicization says something don't just blindly trust them because what they are saying sounds nice.

The republicans have plans,  the only issue is that they havn't consolidated around one, though its debatable whether they need too before they actually have a reasonable chance of repealing Obamacare, i.e. there is a Republican president.

But still the point is they have offered up plans, liberals just ignore them so they can keep pushing this tired talking point.  ",2,0,1442386609,1444725573

They have done things like this before (see quote and article above), and part of the issue is they offer up areas that are too expensive for people to actually want to drill.   Whether this is done as a token gesture or is more just a reflection of the market is up for debate but either way,  Obama could have done tons more over his presidency to grown America's energy industry.  I realize people have their environmental concerns and that's an argument, but I personally am super pro expanding fracking and drilling.

My point is not what's fair but just that Bernie's remark is a cheap populist one liner that does more to incite anger in his base then lead to an intelligent conversation about the intricacies and flaws of our legal system.
