cvtrp24,1,t3_3o2qco,cjt09,"Jim Webb:

- I get the sense that he has very strong judgment when comes to foreign policy, and his background reflects this knowledge. For example, in 2002 he was vocal in his opposition to the Iraq War while Clinton was giving the go-ahead. Arguably, the most important role of the president is to direct America's foreign policy, so I feel it's important that the president has a very strong understanding here and has a clearly elucidated policy. In particular I like how Jim Webb wants to speed up the pivot to Asia, and wants to establish a clear policy for how and when the United States is going to respond and engage to potential threats.
- His priorities include criminal justice reform, reducing the income gap, and increasing investment in national infrastructure, which all seem like pretty solid priorities to me.
- I feel that his economic policies tend to make sense. He wants to lower the corporate tax rate (which most economists agree is too high), tax capital gains as regular income, and increase investment in adult education. I don't always agree with him (he's not as open to free-trade as I would like) but he generally seems to be in line with mainstream economics.
- He's moderate enough that he'd actually be able to work with a GOP Congress. He was able to garner bipartisan support for a major piece of education legislation that he sponsored, which was eventually was signed into law. On the other hand, I feel like a Sanders administration would just end up being more gridlocked than our current state.
- He seems very principled in general. He's said some stuff I disagree with, but I feel that I can trust that what he's saying is what he really believes. I also really like how he tends to be vocal about the importance of a clean separation of powers (for example, he believes that Congress should have to approve any sort of major elective military action). I can't imagine Clinton advocating for such a policy.",20,0,1444404376,1444724888
cvtauqo,0,t1_cvsw0xf,cjt09,"I think you touch on something that does indeed befuddle many incels: how do these Henrys end up getting so many women? A lot of what we tell young men about how to foster attractiveness and how to pursue women is incomplete, outdated, or just wrong. Part of this I feel is due to the incredible sexual and professional liberalization that women have experienced in the past few decades compared to the relative stagnation of the depiction of women and relationships in the media. The messaging just hasn't caught up with the reality in a lot of cases (especially in the sort of media stereotypical incels enjoy like Japanese anime), and so in the absence of any sort of real-life male role model it's pretty easy to lose your way.

That said, I feel that the article's more fundamental point is that many incels aren't frustrated at the ""how"" but at the ""why,"" in sort of a cosmic justice sort of sense. ""Why is it fair that this monstrous man can get a woman he beat and divorced to sleep with him, while I can't even get one?"" ""Why am I stigmatized and ostracized for expressing my frustration?"" ""Why am I being lumped in with these misogynists just because I want a girlfriend?"" While I feel that the ""how"" is something that incels largely need to work on themselves, the ""why"" is something that we as society ought to focus on being better at. I think we can all endeavor to be more understanding of the sort of frustration they're feeling, and treat people as individuals rather than simply as parts of a group.",5,0,1444359547,1444724888
cvssluz,1,t3_3nziuw,cjt09,"I agree with everything he's touched on in the video, and I think a lot of it stems from the game not being as complete as it could have been. Shorter Red Dead Redemption style side-ops would have been cool and broken up the monotony of trekking from one end of the map to the other. But who really wants to spend fifteen minutes taking out Armored Vehicle Unit 26?

The animals are the same way. I actually thought finding and fultoning the animals found throughout the map was pretty cool. But there's only *maybe* a dozen animals that actually appear on the map. The rest don't exist except for a short slide if you put your capture cage in the right place which is incredibly dissatisfying. I get the feeling that the designers originally planned for way more animals to be present on the battlefield (and to sometimes require some tricky techniques to actually capture) but couldn't do it because of time-constraints. That would at least explain why the useless Bait Bottle item is in the game.",34,0,1444330504,1444724888
cvsqc8b,1,t3_3nx196,cjt09,"I feel that Slate Star Codex's article [Radicalizing the Romanceless](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/31/radicalizing-the-romanceless/) did a much better job of capturing the sort of sentiment expressed by the men described in the article. It's a really interesting perspective, and while the entire article is worth a read, if you're short on time you can get the jist of it from a couple of lines:

> “So you beat up your wife, she left you, you married someone else, and then she came back and had an affair on the side with you?” I asked him.  
>  
> “Yeah,” said Henry. 
>  
> ...  
>  
> And I said the same thing as every other nice guy, which is “I am a nice guy, how come girls don’t like me?”  
> There seems to be some confusion about this, so let me explain what it means, to everyone, for all time.  
> It does not mean “I am nice in some important cosmic sense, therefore I am entitled to sex with whomever I want.”  
> It means: “I am a nicer guy than Henry.”  

From that viewpoint, I feel like it's pretty easy to get a grasp of why so many ""incels"" are frustrated.",16,0,1444327237,1444724888
cvqtt3g,1,t3_3nqvgm,cjt09,"One idea that Kripp touched on but didn't really elaborate on is that secrets tend to not be a lot of fun for new players, because you have to already know the possible secrets in order to play around them. Secrets aren't necessarily unique in this regard, but they can be more frustrating because of how visible they are. I don't know what a good solution would be other than making sure that the expert AI is using up-to-date decks that rotate through the possible secrets.

Otherwise, I agree with Kripp--secrets are at their best when they're *secret* and force you to make gutsy and risky plays. It won't always pay off to make the risky plays, but there's some intrinsic excitement there. That's also why Secret Paladin is so frustrating/boring to play against, none of the secrets are actually secret. There's just no excitement there: Mysterious Challenger is going to get dropped on turn 6 and 95% of the time you know if you're going to win or lose based on the state of the board.",24,0,1444182902,1444724888
cvqsdcw,0,t1_cvqibs1,cjt09,"I feel that basic income could get Republican support if it's dressed up in the form of a tax rebate (for example, as part of a [FairTax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairTax) implementation). Several Republican candidates have noted their support for such a tax scheme. Part of this is just semantics, Republicans could call it a rebate while Democrats could call it basic income. Of course, the actual *size* of such a rebate would be a point of contention among the two parties.",1,0,1444180406,1444724888
cvq4ayl,1,t3_3nov31,cjt09,"[Robert MacKenzie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._MacKenzie) reminds me a lot of Big Boss:

- Enlisted in the US Army when he was 17 to fight in Vietnam. Ended up getting shot and declared ""70% disabled"" and unfit for service. He said screw that.
- He traveled to Rhodesia (modern day Zimbabwe) to join the Rhodesian SAS, which had one of the most rigorous selection processes in the world. Fought in the Rhodesian Bush War where he received several awards for gallantry and rose to command his own unit.
- After the Rhodesian Bush War ended he went to South Africa where he eventually became the XO of the Transkei Special Forces Regiment.
- Went on to fight in Central Africa, Croatia, and Bosnia.
- Died in 1995 while serving in Sierra Leone. Incidentally, Operation Intrude N313 also took place in Africa in 1995.",38,0,1444142983,1444724888
