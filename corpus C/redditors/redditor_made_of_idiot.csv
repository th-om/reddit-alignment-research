cvb82u1,1,t3_3m1vwp,made_of_idiot,"The Dalai Llama(which is his *title*, his real name is Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Llama) is the head of the Tibetan Buddhist religion.

They have an elaborate process where, basically 'the signs' tell them which child to select as the next Dalai Llama. He was 4yo when selected.

When China invaded Tibet in 1950, they tried to suppress the Tibetan Buddhism because the Chinese communists were anti-religion. So the Dalai Llama has been living in exile in India since 1959.

Tibet has been associated, in the Western world, with mysticism, since the 1800s (coz of [Mme Blavatsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky)) and in the 'hippy' era, when Buddhism got 'cool', Tibet, and the Dalai Llama, became a kinda 'cool cause' with some celebrities.

He's a respected, charismatic world leader, known for his infectious laugh and 'Yoda'-like disposition (Yoda was based on him), and peaceful, pragmatic style amongst other things. I've seen him speak and he's *very* likable.

TL;DR- He's kinda like the pope for Buddhists, a respected (and hilarious), world leader. And he's also 'Yoda' off Star Wars...",4,0,1443007505,1444725526

cvb7i99,1,t3_3m1q5p,made_of_idiot,"Different cultures have different views of formats/media like 'animation'.

Japanese manga and anime have never been seen as exclusively for 'kids'. Manga, and it's predecessors, have a long history of being  popular media for adults. Proportionately, anime/manga are much more popular (esp with adults) than comics/cartoons in the west.

Europe, and particularly France, also have a tradition of comics (and, to a lesser extent, cartoons) being respected, intellectual (kinda) media for adults.

Japan's peculiar censorship laws (can't show live action genitals) also encouraged the development of porn anime ('ecchi', or 'hentai' IIRC) which allowed more freedom.",2,0,1443005285,1444725526

And there are lists, tables and formulae about the relative size of different muscles and stuff. They can be surpisingly accurate from a small peice of skull because of this.

They used to do all this with, like modelling clay and little pegs (as a guide for the depth of the flesh), but I beleive its mostly digital today. 

Not sure how much they can tell fat vs skinny from, say, a skull, but once they have a model, it'd be easy to select a n average build, or 'skinny/fat it up.'",1,0,1442995041,1444725526
