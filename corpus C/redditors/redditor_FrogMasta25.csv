I haven't seen that. Can you point out where you read that in the Constitution?",1,0,1444676847,1444722177

cvszutz,0,t1_cvsssql,FrogMasta25,"Really though?  I think Obama will be different because the majority of his policies have delays before they are enacted.  

* For example, ACA is barely implemented and the tax provisions aren't implemented yet.  So their effect is unclear.  And the healthcare co-ops are failing now, while prices of insurance are moving up.  We really won't be able to declare if its good or bad for a few more years.

* The situation with Russia is evolving and the lack of containment will take time to see the results. 

* Iran is like Russia - we won't see the results of the Iran deal for a few years, all of which he will be out of office. 

* The lack of fight against the new wave of Islamic extremism will take time as well, such as the Syria policy, Libya and Iraq.   It clearly was a poor decision to not leave the training and intelligence personnel that Iraq said they would allow, and the lack of consistency in his policy and stances in Syria has made a bad situation much worse. 

* China is pushing hard in the South China Sea and building islands without a single check, while regional tensions are soaring.  

All that could blow over and be perfect.  Or could get worse.  It will be interesting if he changes his behavior and acts more like Clinton and Bush (*says out of the fray when leaving office*) or acts more like Carter.   ",2,0,1444341137,1444722177

cvszieg,0,t1_cvqe8uh,FrogMasta25,Bush wasn't viewed favorably but our allies never had to question our resolve or their position.  They knew the US would support them and would keep things status quo.  ,1,0,1444340610,1444722177
cvszhb1,0,t1_cvrf920,FrogMasta25,"Why is that always the strawman response on these two issues?  

*Oh, you don't like what we did?  So I guess you want nuclear war then, right?*

or

*Oh, you don't like the agreement we negotiated?  Well, we shouted for weeks that you can't even mention it in the press or we will call you a traitor, but now we are going to say that since you don't have a better already negotiated and signed deal with Iran on the table so you shouldn't be allowed to criticize it or disagree*

Iran would remain under sanctions.  You continue negotiating while publicly stating that you are going to have real inspections with no delay (especially not the current 24 day deadline before it goes to a committee of nations), constant inspections on sites with no limit of adding sites if evidence suggests it, and no time horizon on when they are able to build their own nukes.   By keeping a firm line and keeping it public, other countries are forced to follow suit.

Russia is even simpler.  At the start of the conflict, back before Crimea was annexed and it was still just Russia irregulars out of uniform that were paying thugs to do it, you announce that you are going to *honor the agreement that Clinton signed with the Ukraine*.   You deploy 10,000 peace keeping troops in Ukraine, which wasn't a warzone in any sense at the time and could have safely and comfortably supported them.  And you follow it up with a $20 billion loan to the Ukraine to cover their budget shortfall and support the government, while propping up their currency to a degree.  This is followed up by announcing that the US would like to enter into negotiations to further 'our strong bond'.  Boom, done.  Putin doesn't have a move and is quite contained.

I just see that Bush has the money, the connections and the experience, plus he and Rubio are friends.   I see that overcoming Kaisch's advantage, especially since they can have him campaign very very hard for them knowing that he can get a top cabinet post. ",1,0,1444156924,1444722177

cvq8j2j,0,t1_cvq7q4m,FrogMasta25,"Experience.  Where they play well.  And neither is offensive to moderates.  With Bush as VP, it takes a lot of ammo from attack ads that would be used if he was running as Pres. 

Bush will have serious support from Texas due to his brother. His experience and name recognition aren't limited like traditional candidates and I think regionally he will play very well in the Midwest.

Rubio is Hispanic and I believe that he will play well in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas due to it.  He wouldn't turn off core white voters and while he is pro-life enough to get them to come out and vote, he won't turn off pro-choice.   He will transcend like Obama did to multiple state bumps. Most importantly, it locks the toss-up Florida's votes and we all know Florida is a key state. 

It will put them at 241 elector votes while taking California from a guarantee Blue to a Blueish tint/Possible Toss Up.  It will move Nevada from a toss up to a Red as well as New Mexico to Red.  Wisconsin will go Red looking at its last few elections and the strength GOP has put into it.  North Carolina is leaning Red as is Virginia, which a Clinton ticket would find very hard to win.   The same policies that voters love in California and the Northeast are big turn offs for Ohio, Virginia, and North Carolina.   

I view it like an Obama/Clinton would have been. Home state advantage for Illinois plus racial identity politics. Clinton would have been more identifiable nationally due to her husband and thus her bump isn't Arkansas but rather cluster of places in the US - like the Northeast.",0,0,1444149547,1444722177
