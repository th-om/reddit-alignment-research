...yeah. that's my point. I don't want comedy, Alton. I don't want silly skits and costumes and whatever else. I want a cooking show.",-2,0,1444454207,1444723862

But now, I have [J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt](http://www.seriouseats.com/user/profile/Goodeaterkenji) and he's better in every conceivable way.  ",-9,0,1444423293,1444723862

I have Kodi launcher installed (see Method 3 [here](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Bypass_Home_on_Fire_TV#Xposed_and_rbox_module_.28Requires_root.29)). When I reboot the FireTV, Kodi kicks in, but for some reason it kicks in before networking has been started, so it doesn't see my network shares.  I have to then restart Kodi on its own, which is exactly what I am asking for in this thread.

But thanks for the tip, I didn't know that was a way to restart the unit.  I'll keep it in mind.
