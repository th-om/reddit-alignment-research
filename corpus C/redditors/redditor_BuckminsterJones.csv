cvw8014,1,t3_3obucz,BuckminsterJones,"I'm no economist, but isn't competitiveness the key ingredient? Big rewards spur big gambles. I don't see how the number of billionaires returns any useful information. If a market is genuinely competitive? Won't the pay-outs from gambles accurately reflect their risks? A million people all taking long-shots? That's good... right? And the winners cash-out.

Of course, I have no idea where these competitive markets are supposed to be, I'm seeing cronyism and corruption everywhere I look.",7,0,1444598497,1444720746
cvuf74v,0,t1_cvuew5i,BuckminsterJones,Thanks. I'm glad I'm not totally senile. It does get confusing.,1,0,1444443345,1444720746
cvudp2n,0,t1_cvudbp1,BuckminsterJones,"Here, I'll show my work, and you tell me where I'm going wrong....


6x6x6x6x6x6 = 46,656 different combinations. Right?




One die yields 1:6


Two die yields (1x 5) + 6 = 11:36


Three die yields (11x5) + 36 = 91:216


Four die yields (91x5) + 216 = 671:1296


Five die yields (671x5) + 1296 = 4651:7776


Six die yields (4651x5) + 7776 = 31031:46656


66%.... right?

cvua7b4,0,t1_cvu9ntn,BuckminsterJones,"That ain't right. The odds of rolling at least one six on six attempts is not lower than the odds of rolling a six in one attempt. I think you're calculating the odds of rolling exactly one six, but the 'record' would still be six if you roll one or two or five sixes.",2,0,1444433419,1444720746

cvu8pdb,0,t1_cvu86xx,BuckminsterJones,You're right. There could be a few 7s mixed in as first rolls after making her point. It's hopeless. For me anyway :),1,0,1444430679,1444720746
