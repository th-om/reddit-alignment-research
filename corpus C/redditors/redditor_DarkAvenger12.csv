cvsx0v4,1,t3_3nzhpo,DarkAvenger12,"I'm going to go hard on my fellow Democrats and hope they get rough questions:
 
* How do you balance gun safety/control with our Second Amendment rights? Do you agree with the SCOTUS interpretation of the Amendment?
* Wouldn't overturning *Citizens United* have unintended consequences worse than the status quo? Why are you advocating for the possibility of government censorship?
* Free trade had been shown by an overwhelming number of economists to be a net good for the economy and people throughout the world. If you're serious about helping the needy throughout the world, why are you advocating against trade policies that help them?
* Simple jobs in manufacturing and service can sometimes be better performed by machines than people nowadays. Is it worth losing these jobs in the short term to lead the world in new jobs and technologies elsewhere?",1,0,1444336894,1444717584

cvo4x16,0,t1_cvo3gij,DarkAvenger12,"A lot of people conflate being an independent (a choice of what party appeals to you) with being a moderate (a middle-ground ideological position). If you jump between voting Democrat, Socialist, Communist, Justice etc depending on who's running you'd be an independent but certainly no moderate. The main parties try to appeal to moderates, not independents unless one of their pet issues is your flavor of the month.",18,0,1443989655,1444717584
cveutmb,1,t3_3mfmw8,DarkAvenger12,"I think people are making this a lot more confusing than it has to be. If someone isn't actively giving you a ""yes"" verbally or with sign language or something like that then you don't need to initiate or continue. If someone is drunk enough to the point that you ask yourself, ""Can this person reasonably consent,"" then you probably shouldn't continue no matter what that person says. If someone has the slightest buzz or hasn't even felt it yet then they could reasonably consent. But there's always risk when sex is involved (pregnancy, STIs, emotional stress etc.) and you have to acknowledge that there is a risk you sleep with some horrible person who ruins your life by lying about revoking or never giving consent when they explicitly did.

If you're *that* paranoid then you need to have video evidence and signed contracts in the presence of a notary stating that consent was given.",2,0,1443281755,1444717584
