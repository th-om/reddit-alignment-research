Wasn't too exciting since we are really close and both openly ex mo, so it was just like ""Oh, you go to that sub sometimes too? Cool.""",3,0,1443736633,1444724604
cvd74u1,0,t1_cvd6cmx,BurningWithSanders,"Oh, I agree. For some clarification on my thought process:

I'm a left-libertarian/independent. I did a lot of campaigning for Ron Paul in 2012 and was a delegate and stuff, and supported primary challengers for seats like the governor, senate, and representative seats in my state. None of my preferred candidates won their primaries though, so in the general election I ended up just writing in garbage bullshit names rather than vote for the douche or the turd. I did vote seriously for Gary Johnson and for some of the local offices. 

I expect to be active during primary season again this election (probably spend my time on Bernie/as a democrat though since I am in a blue state instead of Red state now), but by the time of the general election, I might not bother voting this time if there aren't any good candidates on the ballot.

cvcxmbu,0,t1_cvcmxil,BurningWithSanders,"The [majority of Americans](http://www.pewforum.org/2014/03/28/shrinking-majority-of-americans-support-death-penalty/) support the death penalty (although support is on a decidedly downward trend). From that pew study, about 3/4 of republicans support the death penalty, a little less than half of democrats support it, and a little more than half of independents support it. Even for democrats there isn't really a clear support for ending it, let alone bipartisan support. ",4,0,1443124296,1444724604
cvcvyfv,1,t3_3m8cuj,BurningWithSanders,"I've posited this theory a few other times in threads like this. 

First, no strong(er) frontrunner emerges by the time primaries are underway. This can either be from the field remaining wide, or the GOP base remaining split behind various ""factional"" front runners, or a combination of both. 

Assuming we get this first condition, I think we will see the states splitting support among the establishment candidate, tea party/evangelical candidate, and Trump. I predict that that will be Rubio, Cruz, and Trump. 

If Rubio (or other establishment candidate), cannot manage to win a clear majority of delegates by the time the convention comes around.... we might be looking at a brokered convention. If between Trump and Cruz they have a majority of delegates, then I expect that they would pool their delegates by sharing the ticket and take the nomination. 

So we'd have Trump/Cruz and they would get owned in the general election. ",1,0,1443121863,1444724604

They have said that they will [return it](http://www.buzzfeed.com/kyleblaine/scott-walker-is-dropping-out-of-republican-primary-race?utm_term=.hg5djDMdR&sub=4031181_6923485#.deK9pvROV) to donors.

>A spokesman for the pro-Walker super PAC, Unintimidated, which reported raising $20 million in July told BuzzFeed News the group will soon start sending cash back to its donors. “In light of the governor’s announcement, Unintimidated PAC will wind down our existing efforts and return remaining resources to supporters.”",5,0,1442962334,1444724604
cvaq4o7,0,t1_cvanwet,BurningWithSanders,"Yeah, I have been predicting that for awhile too. However, I do believe that Trump/Cruz could pull off an upset at the convention if they walk in with enough delegates between them. I think that is a real possibility, but only time will tell if the GOP will remain so fractured throughout the actual voting season. ",2,0,1442961350,1444724604
