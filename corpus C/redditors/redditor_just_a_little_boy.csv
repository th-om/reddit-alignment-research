But ofcourse, it would have been better to write a nice detailed reply refuting his argument, especially because he is more likely to change his mind if I do that. However I don't feel like wasting anymore time correting people who make dumb mitakes who also firmly believe they are right even tho they could find out the truth in less then a minute, people who are just spewing Nazi propaganda and are too stupid to understand it.  It kinda pisses me off.

But yes, you are right. I just don't care.  

edit: considering that this was [his reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3o30o9/til_in_1923_germanys_hyperinflation_was_so_high/cvu03jm), he truly is clueless and a long post would have been a good Idea (or a better school education about such things...) so you are right again!

cvtutfu,0,t1_cvtpzch,just_a_little_boy,"I see, you read /r/til aswell. However the quote is taken out of contect, what he actually wanted was a much, much harder restriction on Germany. He would have cut Germany into parts and would have redrawn the borders so that France control the territory up to the Rhein, so Germany is never going to be strong enough again to be agressive towards France. It took me 2 minutes to find and read the wikipedia page.

cvtuk61,0,t1_cvtq3j6,just_a_little_boy,are you suggesting that the Treaty of Versailles is responsible for the rise of third Reich?,1,0,1444408692,1444729116
cvrknd3,0,t1_cvrad91,just_a_little_boy,"Probably because there are quite many people commenting that are from the US (largest group of redditor come from there) and the OP is from India so there is a disconnect between him and many comenters here? 

And probably because the US is the example on the opposite spectrum compared to India, one of the most reserved nations when it comes to sex in the West. (compared to France, Spain, Germany etc) 
Also it is on the opposite end of the spectrum when it comes to House/apartment sizes.

And most of the post are based on cultural norms, the answer to this question does mostly depend on personal morals and your upbringing, which means that the cultural norms that you grew up with and that are in place today are mostly responsible for the answer to this question, so I think it is EXTREMLY relevant.
