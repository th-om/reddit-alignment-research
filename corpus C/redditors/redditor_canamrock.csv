cvrc7er,0,t1_cvrbmsb,canamrock,"> They did the heinous crime, if it leads to pain, disfigurement of death that's the bed they made.

Constitution disagrees, sorry. Targeted shit like that is definitionally unusual if we know the inmates are going for certain traits, and that is pretty decidedly cruel. Never mind the notion that the person could well be falsely imprisoned.",9,0,1444231211,1444720556
cvp4cig,1,t3_3nkvg5,canamrock,"As much as part of me has enjoyed some of Atheism is Unstoppable's videos, it should be clear that he is basically a straight-up bully. Most of the time I've managed to see him make points against the TYT crew, I feel like the very video of theirs he shows contradicts the thrust of the argument he's trying to make. Yes, there are fucked up Muslims, and yes, what they do is different from what extremist Christians over here are doing, but when you try to rope an entire religious following in with the worst elements of it, you only help the very people you claim to hate most.

That's been the core TYT argument, too - you can despise the bad parts of Islam and be super on board for fucking over terrorists and despots without making every civilian who worships Allah entirely culpable for the actions of the extremists.

If there was a video where he wasn't just getting on a tirade of Cenk being a fat Christian basher or whatever, it might be interesting to see. But I just feel that given how unrepentantly he bashes anyone and everyone, it's disturbing for anyone to support his channels.",2,0,1444067027,1444720556
cvmf4ts,0,t1_cvlzu81,canamrock,"Except how do you prove a categorical negative? The tactics seen here are right in step with those used to discredit ACORN. It doesn't really matter what the facts are, since it is always possible for the opposition to cast a cloak of doubt over the tiniest details that do not unmistakably line up with innocence, just as how the videos reinterpreted a rough but entirely valid conversation into something obscene on its face. It would be on the opposition to expose some valid information to make their dark claims appear to hold any weight for legal investigation. But that's not the goal - killing federal funding merely requires enough Congresspeople to be more accountable to the disgusted than the truth-loving. ",1,0,1443841049,1444720556
cvmbc2m,0,t1_cvm8kby,canamrock,"Yup. I couldn't even handle that opening bit about stereotypes. They're super true, huh? Done. Check, please.

I love how so many people seem to just actively miss the stuff Cenk and the other TYT people say that shoot the arguments in the foot most of the time. If you don't like them, don't watch. If you have some critique, make it. But if it's going to be this level of drivel (the video, not the above post), maybe don't bother.",6,0,1443832785,1444720556
cvmb0so,0,t1_cvma1ye,canamrock,"While not all cases of being depressed are by any means necessarily requiring medical treatment, there are many people for whom treatment beyond simple self-reflection or behavioral adjustment is sufficient. Fortunately there are professionals who are trained to figure out the difference, and it would be much safer for everyone if it was as easy as feasible for people to be checked out when they're unsure if they would be better served by a more clinical solution or less bodily invasive means.",3,0,1443832118,1444720556
cvlzmpn,0,t1_cvly9ox,canamrock,"It seems likely he could be the ""Bernie"" of the more actively upset part of the party that Hillary can't appeal to and Bernie has mostly eschewed beyond the large leftist gulf he inhabits currently.

Just because crazy people go and cinnamon challenge all over their communities doesn't mean hard working chefs shouldn't be allowed access to whatever microbes they feel necessary to keep their kitchens safe from criminals and government.",6,0,1443751237,1444720556
cvl4qcx,0,t1_cvl3zzv,canamrock,"Even worse, they get a win-win scenario. If they get elected in, cut services, and the inertia of a superior system holds, they can claim boldly that their plan works. And if they stay in power and find the fruits of their labor collapsing around? Simply blame the systems still in place, claiming you just need those removed to finally show the market what's what.",83,0,1443743957,1444720556
