cvpniyn,0,t1_cvpcha8,ultimis,"> My point is a little bit broader than that: that the meaning of a term itself can change over time without violating the drafter's intent of that term.

And my point is the meaning didn't really change if the framers intentionally left it vague. How it is applied has changed. That vague clause in the Constitution does have limits though. You cannot infinitely interpret it to allow any powers within the federal government. That limitations is based on framers intent. How did the framers intend for that provision of the Constitution to mean.

Your example of trans-fats is dealing with specifics. Again, did the meaning of ""freedom of press"" change when we understood it as also applying to the internet? Nope. Freedom of press is the ability to publish so that others are able to read it. The intent is not limited by technology of that time unless they specifically detailed the methods in which it was protected. We don't have the freedom to publish only from the methods available at the time that amendment was passed. The wording doesn't support it, neither does the intent of the framers of that amendment.

>""Necessary and proper"" and ""cruel and unusual"" might be the most commonly recognized phrases that are context dependent. An un-air-conditioned prison in the deep south might qualify today as cruel and unusual, when such a prison obviously would not have been so before the invention of air conditioning.

And I would say that's a slippage of the intent of those clauses. That wouldn't be a legitimate example, as they are violating the intent of the law. Needless punishment that does not fit the crime would be unusual, cruel is definitely context dependent but was intended to bar torture as a form of punishment. Your example would be like a kid claiming his school forcing him to give a speech (public speaking) was cruel and unusual since it forced him into a extremely uncomfortable situation. 

>hen perhaps you misunderstand where the courts have found a right to privacy. It's loaded into the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (when we're talking about the limits of federal power) or of the Fourteenth Amendment (for state power). It's the same clause that requires people to get a hearing before losing their food stamps, that requires courts to only exercise jurisdiction over people who have been engaged in activity in their state, that protects the right to abortions, that makes the states have to follow the bill of rights, that requires courts to ensure that defendants have notice of lawsuits against them before entering a judgment, that requires states to allow parents to send their children to private school or to teach their children foreign languages, and that requires states to recognize interracial marriages and gay marriages.

I'm sorry, but what a bunch of non-sense. I'm fully aware of the due process clause and the vast over interpretation the courts have done in the 20th century regarding it. Again due process and ""liberty"" are being liberally interpreted to mean whatever they want it to mean. You could essentially use this to claim there is a right of wearing funny hats, a right of being naked in public, a right to bitch slap anybody you see, etc. You cannot just imagine anything and everything as a ""liberty"" and then claim the government is unable to act without another clause that is liberally interpreted ""due process"".

Further more you still cannot extrapolate a ""Right of privacy"" from it (even with the ignoring the intent of the clause). The intent can be determined by any reasonable person not trying to exploit the clause by the very next segment:

>nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

They specify ""fair"" in terms of how property can be acquired for public use. The same principle is applied in due process as they are saying you can lose life, freedom and property as long as there is a fair legal process in which it is removed.

The right of privacy was derived not just from the 5th amendment but the 3rd and 4th amendments were sourced in the ruling as a basis that the framers saw a right of privacy. These amendments were specific in their intention, but the courts assumed broader meaning without actual intent to support it.

>And with the intentional vagueness of the word ""due"" in ""due process,"" the situations in which one might say that a particular process is due will depend on the societal context, including contexts never before fathomed by the drafters. 

Only in the mind of a justice attempting to justify their position within our government. Due process is a defined process setup by the government. So say we want to remove someones life via capital punishment. We have a process for that and it can't be expedited. That process that ends the life can be changed (though the courts would of course fight it to defend their Judicial Supremacy) as long as it is consistent and done before the crime it is to be applied to.

I don't have any historical text on hand for this amendment. Using a modern definition (which may not be accurate for the framers):

due(adj): ""of the proper quality or extent; adequate.""

Who defines that? Well the laws themselves of course. We have thousands of pages of criminal justice laws (just in a single state). 

>For example, I think there's a plausible argument that notifying someone of a lawsuit by publishing a notice in a newspaper no longer comports with due process, even if it was understood as fair notice when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.

This isn't some vague murky realm of technicalities. The laws can (and should) be adjusted if there are issues. It is not up to the opinion of a single justice, or the SCOTUS to suddenly decide that centuries of precedent are no longer valid. Society is not unable to act to reform it's own laws.

>So the disagreements between people on the proper interpretation of a particular constitutional provision isn't really between a vision of a living Constitution or a fixed Constitution, but rather whether a particular phrase is best interpreted to be flexible over time.

No, not at all. A living Constitution does not need to be amended because they can extend meaning/intent to provisions within the Constitution that never intended for such a meaning to exist. And in some cases it directly contradicts the framers intent. The courts have not ruled on this, but ""birth right citizenship"" another baby out of the 14th amendment that you forgot is being widely supported as a Constitutional Provision. This is in the face of every framer who helped write the 14th amendment specifically stating that it did not apply to people not from this nation.  A living Constitution is Kennedy in one of his latest rulings claiming ""Hey I just discovered a right that neither the framers who wrote the 14th amendment, nor the last 150 years of judicial review have ever even came close to considering"". It's a concept that based on the need of the time you can interpret clauses to mean more instead of having a new amendment to rectify the over sight. This is called Tyranny of the minority. As instead of how this country was actually designed (really hard to amendment the base foundation of this countries legal frame work even with a majority) a small group who stacks the courts can achieve what a majority cannot do.

It is unethical. It violates the rule of law. And generalized clauses are still limited by intent.

cvpb1tv,0,t1_cvop9u6,ultimis,"> You could also say people wouldn't trust a contract with no expiration date, that is irrevocable, self-sustaining or flexibility either, which is what the Constitution is. I wouldn't at least. Thomas Jefferson himself said the Constitution should be re-written every 19 years. Just saying.

Except the amendment process allows modifications of the Contract. Nearly everything in the Constitution can be changed (except something like state representation). If the contract becomes ""void"" than the country is void. I agree that we should have constitutional conventions every so often, but the Constitution is the foundation document for our legal framework. It's change should be really difficult to accomplish, as it has huge wide reaching impacts.

>You really think so? I believe they could have gotten much more specific, but they chose not to.

Not if they didn't want to undermine the government that they were creating.

>I don't see where you get this. I think you would be much better off arguing that they are leading you on a push toward dictatorship.

While Judicial Tyranny looks like a dictatorship, it really has no power to enforce itself. Public opinion is the only thing that makes it relevant. If people decided the court opinions held no weight this wouldn't be a problem (we would have other problems).

Why does this lead toward anarchy? Because each time they violate the rule of law, the less people have faith in the system. The more people lack faith in the system the less likely they are to follow the system. If people don't follow the system, the system breaks down. A break down of the system is anarchy. Generally anything can happen after this point (like a Dictatorship).

>I think this is where the conversation gets really, really interesting. The Constitution is silent on how it should be interpreted, and the part constructing the Supreme Court is strikingly short compared to others.

That is because a lot of it is based off of English Common law. They took things for granted. 

>It has been asserted that the framers expected, or even intended for judicial review to exist, because they chose not to explicitly prohibit it. 

And I would say the lack of outrage over judicial review from the framers supports this (most of them were still alive when judicial review was enacted). Judicial review is a logical application of their powers. As they are tasked with applying laws *under the Constitution*. They are not above the Constitution, but they still must apply the Constitution to congressional/state laws. This means in their application they are charged as the body to determine when there is a conflict. When that body acts in a bad way (such as making up Constitutional law from the bench to suite their political interests) than they are no longer ""under the Constitution"" and have violated the office that they hold. Thus congress should (but hasn't) impeach such abuses of power by the judicial.

The Constitution specifies all powers of the federal government. Those not ""explicitly stated"" are actually left to the states and to the people (clarified by the 10th amendment). A lot of things were not prohibited to the courts (such as having it's own army) but we're not going to presume to think that it can have an army.

>I don't know that I necessarily agree, I find original intent to be of fading importance the further away we are and the more our country evolves from the days of ratification.

Again this is a matter of rule of law. If you find the Constitution dated, get the Constitution changed via the amendment process. I might find the speed limits to be meant for elderly people and bad drivers, that doesn't mean I get away with speeding. No one is above the rule of law. Law comes from the democratic process in our Constitutional Republic. And it applies to everyone.

>After all, the Constitution once condoned slavery, and mandated the return of runaway slaves.

I'm only aware of the returning of slaves.

""No person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.""

The 3/5ths compromise existed to limit the power of the slave states. Else they would have been more representation in the house of reps from them.

That provision I quoted was changed by the Amendment process. All future amendments supersede older text/amendments unless the Constitution specifically states it cannot be changed.

>Times have changed quite a bit, and I don't know that the amendment process is the only tool we have to apply the document in the modern age.

When you live in a Constitutional Republic it is. You can pass an amendment to make it easier or allow different ways to modify the Constitution. The progressives in the early 20th century tried to do just this. It failed.

>a constitution [is] intended to endure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs

Which amendments do. The SCOTUS via judicial review can help to adapt stuff that was intended to be applied, but is not obvious. The intention needs to be there though. It can't just come out of the SCOTUS' ass.

>I think you mean 14th? Citizenship clause? 15th prevented race restrictions on voting.

Typo. Thanks.

>Isn't the following will of the ""public at large"" the entire point of a democracy? In this case which do you believe should be followed? Framers intent, literal interpretation, or the will of the people?

When dealing with the government and rule of law, it is always framers intent. If the public cares enough about it they will put pressure on their representatives to reform the system. That new reform will have it's own intent and text to support it.

I'm not in support of literal interpretation only. As it is impossible for those who compromised and crafted the bill to perceive changes in language/culture/technology. I have already seen numerous people attempt to back up their Constitutional assertions by applying modern usage of words to back up their claims. At the very least you would need to look at the intent of how it was used (such as the language/culture of the time).",1,0,1444076965,1444718892

>Some parts of the Constitution are very specific such as housing troops while others are as specific as they could get with very broad and complicated stuff.

Yes some aspects of the Constitution are left open, but the intent of those passages still has limitations on the scope of such interpretation. ""Freedom of press"" allows any American the ability to publish their words no matter how offensive the government finds them. With new technology such as the internet, the ability to publish their writing on the internet is such as freely protected as the *intent* (not spirit, that's just bullshit) still applies. We can also use framers intent from that to know that this protection does not protect defamation and graffiti on public/private property not of the owners. Yet the text reads that the right to a free press shall not be infringed by the government. 

>So the debate in constitutional interpretation is whether particular phrases in the Constitution are supposed to be interpreted flexibly or not, and what the scope of that flexibility is. A blanket statement of ""strict interpretation"" doesn't really tell us anything about the words and phrases that were intended to adapt to the contexts that they're applied in.

Except had you read my post you would have understood the limitations. Strict interpretation deals with the intent/text of the law proposed. If the law is very specific, than no you cannot reinterpret it to meet modern day needs. For instance had the 2nd amendment guaranteed the right to muskets (specific) than you cannot apply that to all other arms/guns. This is why I strongly disagree with the courts regarding the right to Privacy, as the bill of rights dealing with privacy were very *specific* in what was not allowed.

Sometimes the intent is not specific as I pointed out above dealing with press. So technological changes don't require that a new amendment be added to protect publishing on the internet.

To put simply if you can interpret something specific like commerce beyond the scope of what the framers meant when they wrote commerce you have essentially passed a Constitutional Amendment without the amendment process. Constitutional amendments are hard to pass and require 3/4ths of the states to validate it's passage. The federal government (via the Constitution) was give zero power to change the Constitution (all 3 branches, judicial does not have this power). This doesn't mean judicial review can't happen. This doesn't mean a president can't refuse to do what he thinks is a unconstitutional actions given a law passed by congress. This doesn't mean congress can't impeach either of those for unconstitutional actions.",1,0,1444075398,1444718892
