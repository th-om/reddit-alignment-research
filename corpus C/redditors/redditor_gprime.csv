I'm going to go out a limb and say that a joke is orders of magnitudes different from society-wide ideological indoctrination starting in elementary school. I'll also boldly suggest that perhaps there's a difference between mocking a behavior or attitude, as this does, and somebody's fixed identity (like Jews being the descendants of apes and pigs, as PA textbooks have expressed). And of course that is only comparing speech with speech. More significantly, I hope even the most deluded can realize that even if you wanted to do something insane like argue that this image is hate speech, that is categorically less problematic than stabbing random civilians in the street.

cvxroks,0,t1_cvxoa52,gprime,"I'm not sure how you expect this to work, as while it doesn't receive quite the same degree of backlash, I've never understood it to be particularly socially acceptable to read any of the ""lads mags"" in public that people buy as a Playboy alternative. Besides which, since the average person doesn't read Playboy, there's no reason to suppose the average person will be aware of this change and thus alter how they view somebody reading it. Meanwhile, the reality is that while Playboy has quite a bit to offer beyond nudity (and I personally would argue the nudity has been worthless since they started allowing tattooed women to be photographed), the inclusion of nudity is still a fundamental part of its identity, and I expect this decision will lose them more existent customers than it will gain them new customers.

cvxixsw,0,t1_cvxhkpt,gprime,"> It's no worse than to live in capitalist Nepal, 

Whatever you want to call Nepal, capitalist it is not. Since ending monarchy, there've been three relevant political parties: Nepali Congress, Unified Communist Party (Maoist), and Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist). The most moderate of them, Nepali Congress, went from being overtly socialist to democratic socialism. And in fact over the weekend they just elected a new Prime Minister, Khadga Prasad Oli, who is a Marxist. 

> in fact it's actually better.

Insofar as Bhutan is much more politically stable, and is also less often ravaged by natural disasters, this is probably true. But I wasn't commenting on Nepal. Were I, I could just as easily have made the exact same comment. Both countries suit the romantic notions of eastern mysticism and a simple life to pretentious white westerners who are passing through and will get back to drinking their fair trade coffee in the Priuses on the way to yoga in a week or two. Living in either country would be terrible.

>  People don't understand this has more to do with living in the Himalayas than anything else.

I agree in part. That is to say, I think the countries of that area are/were miserable places to live, but I think to put blame on those  mountains excuses away too much poor governance. Tibet was perhaps the worst offender before the Chinese occupation. It was a highly repressive theocracy with zero modernizing development and a terrible standard of living for all. Whatever the faults of the Chinese, the average Tibetan is lucky that their country was taken over.",5,0,1444693006,1444720616
cvxhp5z,0,t1_cvxf4bk,gprime,"Like everybody, I have moments of rage where I'd like to smash somebody's face in. I don't, both because I'm mindful of the law and because I believe violence against another person is categorically unacceptable except in self-defense. And so I don't. Hunting would be a means of channeling those impulses, and doing so productively by making food in the process, getting a trophy (species dependent), and potentially controlling the balance of a sensitive ecosystem.
