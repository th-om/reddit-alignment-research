cvkdrby,1,t3_3n2a0z,Badgertime,"So from what I've picked up as an Anth Grad student is that Siberia at that time (Pleistocene) had open river valleys that were relatively protected from the harsh cold of the ice age. A group of people, probably not those from east Asia with mongoloid skull construction, ended up in this area and expanded east across the land bridge, following the seafood, as others have detailed. The terrain on the other side of the bridge, though, was very icy and actually had channels where there was limited ice where people could pass through to go south into the continent (through the Yukon) and survived until everything became a lot easier when the temperature raised.

If you're asking why people migrate, there are a variety of reasons, but generally as I understand it, people fill food sources and set up ways to govern those food sources and their means of securing the food (other people) then anyone who doesn't like it or experiences serious group conflict can go expand elsewhere at their own risk.

cvcjmue,0,t1_cvcjf7z,Badgertime,"He doesn't even tackle... There was one play where he was dropped in a cover2 buc where he had a zone in the flat and his guy caught the ball out of the backfield and he completely whiffed on the tackle and let the rest of the defense clean up his mess. It went from essentially a no gain play to 4-6 yard completion. It helped that they were backed up from penalties, but that was a pathetic showing.",1,0,1443103467,1444730248
