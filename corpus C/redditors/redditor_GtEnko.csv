cvxv8nl,0,t1_cvxthoq,GtEnko,"Johnson, last season, started 55% of his starts in the Dzone, while Shattenkirk started 55% of his starts in the Ozone.  It's a difference-maker, sure, but it shouldn't impact it enough to see the discrepancy that we saw between their PPGs (.48 vs .78, respectively).  While Johnson's QoC is definitely higher than Shattenkirk's (that just goes without saying when you're on the first pairing), even that shouldn't really be enough to explain away the discrepancy, especially when considering that Johnson is on the ice more.  

Even if Johnson was equal in terms of offense to Shattenkirk, he still falls short in every other stat.  While things like a low corsi can also be explained by QoC, it's not nearly enough to bring Johnson's corsi down to the low level it was at last season.  Sure, those numbers are fine considering the team Johnson was on, but there are no statistics to suggest that Johnson is the better player.

And yeah, I agree with you.  But at the end of the day it comes down to the initial argument of ""Johnson is better than Shattenkirk"" and I just don't agree with that statement at all.  Johnson is a very good player, but the VERY best case scenario for him is that they're even in what they can bring to a team, which I think is even a bit of a stretch.",1,0,1444714407,1444721663
cvxqvc3,0,t1_cvxqq8d,GtEnko,Rattie just slipped my mind for some reason.  I expect he'll be with upshall and gomez as Fabbri's replacement,2,0,1444705468,1444721663

cvxg2dx,1,t3_3oi7y9,GtEnko,I fucking hate this.  He was all set to have his breakout year with a solidified spot on the roster.  Why does this shit have to happen?,21,0,1444688371,1444721663
cvx7fx5,0,t1_cvx74f2,GtEnko,".49 PPG is fine for a DMan, but many many defensemen in the league score above that.  Players with similar ice time to Johnson also manage to keep better possession numbers, and the two minutes Johnson plays more than Shattenkirk a game should not impact his corsi and fenwick enough to make them that much below Shattenkirk's.  If that's the case, then that's pretty bad and he really shouldn't be getting that average ice time.  

I'm not trying to argue that Johnson is bad by any means, but there are no statistics that suggest that Johnson is the better player.  It may be close, but everything supports the claim that Shattenkirk is all around the better defenseman.",1,0,1444675790,1444721663
cvx6rdo,0,t1_cvx66bc,GtEnko,"Not enough to account for the significant difference in scoring, as well as the fact that Johnson just has more ice time in general.  ",1,0,1444674808,1444721663
cvx5s6z,0,t1_cvx4a1v,GtEnko,"Shattenkirk starts in the OZone as much as Johnson starts in the DZone, and Shatty has better defensive numbers.

Also his Qoc used to be lower than first pairing, but he's been playing a lot with our first two lines, meaning he's playing against their shutdown defensive pairing and their stronger lines.  He's also our strongest player on the PP, and he's been utilized very well on the PK.",1,0,1444673406,1444721663
cvx4vzd,0,t1_cvwgzbd,GtEnko,"Will most likely do much better than last year, but the Central Division is fucking insane.  

Heard he's aight.

Hindsight is 20/20, but there are a lot of players that should've gone over E.J.",1,0,1444672113,1444721663
cvx4mba,0,t1_cvwq9zi,GtEnko,"We'll see.  Brouwer's looking like he fits in really well on our roster.  Oshie's obviously the better player, but Copley's been our best goaltending prospect.  We have enough scoring without Oshie.

The choking isn't random luck.  Hitchcock falls apart and the roster loses faith in him, disjointing our play.

I'm on the Julien train once Boston ultimately fires him.  I would've liked McLellan or Byalsma over Hitch too.  We can't win in the playoffs with Hitchcock.",1,0,1444671739,1444721663
