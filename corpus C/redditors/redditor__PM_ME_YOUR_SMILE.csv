If you're an elf, then it's your magical land.  If you're a hobbit, then nothing in particular.  That's why hobbits are such good ring bearers. 

Also, the one ring isn't actually that powerful (Unless your name is Sauron), but the thing that makes it so dangerous is that it *convinces* you that it grants great powers, which makes you easier to corrupt.

Investment won't happen if there's no demand.  Demand comes from consumers.  Demand comes first.  

>I don't understand the question. If the market is rewarding investment bankers then they are providing value. If they weren't providing value there would be no pool of money from which they could be paid.

Okay, as an extreme example, do you think crack dealers provide value to the community?  Or do you think that they exploit addiction in order to extract value from the community, at the cost of lives?  Crack addicts *could* spend their money on cars, or education, or take a second job, but instead they spend all their time and money on heroin.  

Just because something is *profitable* doesn't mean that it's *good for the economy*.  Likewise, a job's value to the economy isn't necessarily proportional to their salary.  The guy who invented the polio vaccine didn't see a dime for his invention, but he still saved millions of lives.  The CEO of Compaq destroyed that company in about 8 years, but he got paid millions of dollars.  ",2,0,1444597832,1444716450
cvw6sg6,0,t1_cvw691m,_PM_ME_YOUR_SMILE,"There's a difference between investing and spending.  Rich people invest their money such that it gives them as much money as possible back.  Poor people spend their money on things that they want or need, and they don't get their money back.  

If you invest $10 in McDonald, you expect $11 back.  If you buy $10 worth of burgers, then that $10 goes to pay workers, buy food, and pay rent.  

Investing isn't nefarious, but it doesn't ""create jobs"".  Consumer spending creates jobs.
