cvx0y1c,0,t1_cvwk3ne,ASpanishInquisitor,Well I'd have rather kept the two picks as well but as long as McDermott can keep up this shooting then I'll be pretty happy. Basically I wanted one solid rotation player out of the picks and thought that it was probably a better bet just to use both. I'd probably stick to that opinion until proven McDermott is a rotation player but it seems odd to be so upset about the possibility of being wrong. The draft is a crapshoot even for NBA teams that employ professional scouts.,2,0,1444666156,1444727517
cvwzua3,0,t1_cvwxypd,ASpanishInquisitor,You can break bones on any slide. It just isn't as likely as when you start your slide after you've already arrived at a guy's planted leg and drive through it full speed. Isn't this obvious?,15,0,1444664376,1444727517
cvwzbq5,0,t1_cvwz4qc,ASpanishInquisitor,Hmm... let me see... maybe the fact that Utley slid right on top of the SS and never got further into his slide than on his knee *might* just have something to do with. C'mon LA fans. Even you can admit that was an ugly ass slide. Suspension being baseless on precedent aside that's a terrible play.,2,0,1444663525,1444727517
cvw48l0,0,t1_cvw454f,ASpanishInquisitor,Right I understand the rules. I just have a feeling they will change because this is clearly not something that should be incentivized. And Mets fans have every right to feel cheated about the rules being bad. Not the umpires.,2,0,1444592791,1444727517
cvw4153,0,t1_cvw3edn,ASpanishInquisitor,"Whatever you want to call it reckless, dirty, indecent... but either way the fact that it was such a big play in the game and he was rewarded for it was just awful to watch. I wouldn't expect Dodgers fans to look at that win as tainted because they still won it with what they were given. It happens. At the same time though even if I'm a Dodgers fan I think I'm very understanding of all the Mets fans feeling screwed out of that game. That was rough for their side and I think in the future that kind of play will be called differently.",2,0,1444592484,1444727517
cvw39ku,0,t1_cvw1848,ASpanishInquisitor,"Okay but realize this. If you slide that late you are just asking for an injury to occur. It may not have been his intent but if you throw your entire body weight at full speed into a planted leg you should know full well the consequences. It's not like he had to do that to break up the double play. It is not just unfortunate - it is dirty - let's not mince words here. Again not saying Utley is a monster or anything for doing this. It was spur of the moment but it was way past the line. And as a neutral fan, seeing that be the turning point in the game and Utley rewarded for it was sickening.",-2,0,1444591329,1444727517
cvsxxz9,0,t1_cvselia,ASpanishInquisitor,It turned out all right for the Cubs. The Marlins even gifted us Derrek Lee afterwards for all the trouble. They were always such polite winners just handing out all their talent after they had their fun. I can't believe the Cubs didn't win a single playoff game after that. They had such a stacked team. I suppose it only still hurts that D-Lee had the big hit in game 6 to tie the game but then never won a single playoff game with the Cubs. He was certainly one of the best players of recent Cubs history though. Damn...,1,0,1444338232,1444727517
cvswbi5,0,t1_cvskyyh,ASpanishInquisitor,"But basketball's playoff system has always been much better than baseballs. First off the 7 game series fits basketball much better than baseball to start out with. But it also lets in more teams than it should because you don't just get lucky in basketball - they can do that because talent wins. There are only 4-5 real contenders any given year and sometimes less. Occasionally a 49-33 team in the West might not make it but it hardly matters and is just a sore point with fans not being able to experience the playoffs. Those teams never had a claim to being a conference contender anyways though.

Whereas in baseball given either system they've used lately it just flat out sucks period. Either the 97 win Cubs go home at the end of the year without playoffs as the third best team in the league or the 2nd and 3rd best teams play each other for that honor while significantly worse teams get byes. The playoffs is already a crapshoot in baseball anyways so the play-in game doesn't bother me. The problem is that the best measure of a teams skill, a 162 game season, is essentially meaningless if you don't win your division. And 97-98 win seasons are pretty damn rare which makes that dumb as hell this year. Both the Cubs and Pirates should have been honored as contenders and should at least be on even footing with the division winners that essentially got byes for... winning a lot less... I mean just seed by NL/AL and give the division winners free playoff bids and it's already a much better system even with the oddness of a 1 game playoff.",2,0,1444335883,1444727517

cvqd70k,0,t1_cvqavms,ASpanishInquisitor,"If by ""right"" you mean ""right by might"" or in this case by ability then I guess. But that is undesirable and the intelligence community got what they deserved. Big deal. And yeah, sure, collateral damage is a part of it. But these organizations cause enough collateral damage by simply existing. When you step over the line and lie about it to the extent they did you don't get to whine endlessly about the legitimate concerns the exposure has. Think what you want of Snowden but you cannot ignore the abuse of power and blaring hypocrisy.",0,0,1444156313,1444727517
