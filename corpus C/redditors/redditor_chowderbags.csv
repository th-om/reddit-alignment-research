Were he a student here today, he would consistently get “HP” (High Pass) grades without having to work hard, and he’d get an “H” (High, the top grade) in any class where he wanted to put in the effort.

A strange thing to say when we have W's *actual transcript* from Yale. He was a C student.

Is W dumb? Probably not. But I'm not going to be super impressed that someone who spent decades in politics and has probably been briefed on every subject under the sun might be able to half ass his way through a college political science or business class *now* and get decent marks.",11,0,1444691065,1444721726

cvwzkme,0,t1_cvwwiza,chowderbags,"We're a nation of cowards who wants to puff ourselves up to look brave.

People justify owning and carrying guns on the premise that danger lies around every corner, despite crime being at near historic lows (yeah, crime rates sure are ""soaring"" in major cities, posting numbers that are as bad as they were all the way back in 2006, when they were considered almost miraculously low).

Politicians call for us to be even more ""tough on crime"" (nevermind that that toughness never seems to extend to rich crooks).

I think you'd be hard pressed to come up with a military that has ever been so dominant over every other nation it has contact with, yet apparently the ability to wage wars with the militaries of multiple major powers on opposite sides of the globe single handedly isn't enough for some people. We've gotta put more money into building ships for a navy that already has more aircraft carriers than the rest of the world combines and more tonnage than the next 4 navies put together, and realistically, only the only potential enemies of Russia and China have blue water navies, and Russia's navy is Cold War rustbucket relics. Meanwhile, the Coast Guard could probably take on the navies of most countries. We've got the two largest air forces in the world. We've got more than enough technical and training advantages to take on pretty much any army out there. The only trouble we get in is when we attempt half assed, no brain occupations where we end up doing apparently everything we possibly can to antagonize the local populations.

We get one attack, 14 years ago, and we panic. We shut ourselves down. We were willing to give up on American values so that we could convince ourselves that we were safe, when the reality is that we'll never be safe, there is no ""safe"". And not being entirely safe is ok, provided you're not collectively freaking out.",5,0,1444663931,1444721726

> Showing disrespect towards Conservatives (Social and Fiscal).

Man, must be tough for those who are only one of those and want to post there, or who are generally both but hold a few positions contrary to that, or who aren't ""conservative"" enough.

> Stating your opinion as fact such as: ""Conservatives are all ___________.""

Must make it really awkward when trying to figure out what's disrespectful towards Conservatives. Wonder who decides that.

>Regurgitating Liberal talking points such as: ""The science is 'settled'"" or: ""The parties 're-aligned' back in the 60s.'"" More examples may be found here.

Complete with link to an article saying ""Liberals are all __________"" (the cognitive dissonance, it burrrrrrrns), not to mention a heap of lies, fabrications, and blatantly misleading statements (in an article about liberal ""myths"").

>Posting derogatory comments and/or content about /r/conservative on other forums on reddit.

Welp, looks like I've been banned from /r/Pyong... I mean /r/Conservative.

>We want sincere people here who have good intentions and would like to positively contribute to the Conservative dialogue. This subreddit doesn't exist for Conservatives to be repeatedly confronted and asked to explain, justify, re-assert, and prove themselves or be drawn into debates or teaching moments.
