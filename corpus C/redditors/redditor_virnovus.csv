cvxnzo0,0,t1_cvxlzof,virnovus,"You need nitric acid, I'm assuming.  You can make it *in situ* by mixing concentrated sulfuric acid with a nitrate salt, which I guess is probably what you were planning to do.  Yeah, you can use other salts, although you generally have to use KNO3 if you're making black powder or solid-fuel rocket engines, since other salts will absorb water from the air and make the mixture non-flammable.  But for making a nitrating mixture, you can use just about any nitrate salt.",2,0,1444700917,1444716628
cvxlrjf,0,t1_cvxljjt,virnovus,"If any nitrate salt will work, you can try calling hydroponics stores.  Ammonium nitrate, calcium nitrate, and sodium nitrate should all work as well, so ask if they have any of those too.  I got some from mine once, since they were buying it in bulk to use it to make their own hydroponic solution, but if they're small they'll probably only have the prepackaged solution.",2,0,1444697528,1444716628
