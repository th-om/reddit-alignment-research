cvw5mb9,1,t3_3od894,Zulban,"Fabulous question. I'm going to be doing something very similar soon. I've spoken to a couple retired principals about this, and they say that while this information is technically publicly available with FOIA requests, they suggested I'd have better luck if I keep it friendly. Contact the school board and say you're doing a research project - nothing that is going to get anyone in trouble, and you're not looking to stir anything up. You're just a student or researcher interested in information so you can help schools.

Keep me posted on whatever you try and how it works out.",3,0,1444594786,1444718734
cvtxqvu,0,t1_cvtx47t,Zulban,"> private owners still control the means of production

No they don't - not entirely. They would have more control of their means of production if they could choose how to spend or invest 100% of their revenue. Instead some of it is taxed and that control is taken away somewhat.",2,0,1444413424,1444718734

cvtr4ri,1,t3_3o36um,Zulban,"Too many people answer this question as ""what's your opinion on distractions in the classroom?"" because they assume iphones are bad. Of course distractions are bad for a lesson. The question is whether you can use the technology to the advantage of teaching. Some teachers don't have the technical skills to do this. In other cases, like C_D_Rom mentioned, drama class doesn't need ipads.",9,0,1444403509,1444718734

cvtprc3,0,t1_cvtk3k8,Zulban,"Interesting point.

I'll very quickly admit I am not basing this on anything I've read really. I've only noticed the popular use of the word.

To bring up a point I made elsewhere... isn't public taxation a form of socialism..? In that case the government is ""taking control of the means of production"" somewhat, and using the funds for public good. It seems like by this strict definition, any state with taxes is somewhat socialist.",2,0,1444401359,1444718734
