cvwnc2x,0,t1_cvwn1z2,guntario,"Pretty scary that the key word is simply republican. I'm against the Republican party as much as the next guy, but at least I understand that the Democrats are equally as bad. The average person really thinks, ""Republicans bad. Democrats good."" I run into this with so many people and get caught off guard each time. I honestly keep believing that people can't continue to be so naive and that they'll eventually pick up on how corrupt the government is, but they don't.",11,0,1444627050,1444719182

cvwl2zz,1,t3_3oaw4o,guntario,"I have to say, it was probably the best day of my life. I grew up in San Bernardino, but went into the military and left. I've lived in Washington for a while now, and flew in to see the show. It was 11 hours of AWESOME!!!!!!

Every band I've wanted to see was there. I'm sorry that you guys missed out on this if you didn't attend, but there was in my estimate, probably about 100000 people.. I may be underestimating, but I remember seeing the US festival there with over half a million people. It was awesome!!! 

And I caught one of the sticks that Jordan Burns from Stung Out threw! HAHA! And to the lady that tried to steal it from me... You need to shave your arms, or you may be mistaken for Sasquatch. You're lucky I'd cooled off a bit when I saw you on my plane back to Seattle!",2,0,1444621827,1444719182
