Unless it was a grievous violations of university or NCAA rules - or a repetitive distracting behavior, I find it hard to believe.  Then again, I'm at a work place where the alcohol policy is ""don't be the reason for us to make one"" - over half the office has a bottle of liquor on their desk.",1,0,1444716580,1444722657
cvxvocj,0,t1_cvxtol6,slccsoccer28,"I agree that these are much different issues, but this is not just human life vs ""google indexing your searches"" (which is a gross over simplification of the deeper issues at work here).

My point is that while abortion is an absolutely grave issue, there are very valid arguments and concerns to both sides of the argument. Ultimately, though, the choice to have an abortion is a personal one - and one that if an individual feels strongly enough, should be left to them. This is an issue that does not need to be strictly addressed by law. If you do not believe in abortion, then don't have one and encourage others not to have one. Also, the abortion topic does not need to be a national topic as states are currently free to enact their own laws.

The issues I listed are concerning to me as they are issues that are out of our hands as citizens and take place on extremely large scales - so much so that even if the individual instances aren't grave, the scale is. That take place on a scale that is out of the hands of citizens, states, and in some cases out of the control of the national gov't. I can't choose if the gov't will spy on me (which has proven to destroy lives). I can't choose if corporate interests can lobby laws only favorable to them. I can't choose if the gov't runs secret courts that abide by a secondary set of laws. I can't choose if a pharma company will raise the price of a life-saving drug by 5000%. These issues can't be addressed by citizens or states - they need to be addressed on a national level by national law. 

More worrisome to me is that while these types of issues don't currently seem grave on the surface but - they are issues that very well could be. People have been incarcerated of crimes they shouldn't have been found guilty of because law-enforcement illegally spied on them, then picked and choosed the pieces that built a convenient case. Farmers have literally had their entire life's hard worked screwed over because of the GMO seeds their neighbor planted. The entire country went into a recession because banks lobbied for and abused laws that lead to devastating outcomes - which in turn lead to soaring suicide rates.

These are the type of issues that will only be harder to address.  What happens if lobbying is so bad that laws are literally written only for corporate profit?  What happens when you're a marked a criminal for protesting the gov't and you can't do anything about it because that one time in college you did something really stupid that could end your career?  All of the sudden you the corporate laws that so many of us are fearful of become permanent because anybody who tries do something about them is arrested and blackmailed against their past.

Yes, I am exaggerating - but there is a point to this.  There will **always** be an issue more important than the long term well-being of this country and it's individuals.  If it's not abortion, it's incarceration laws, gun laws, tax code, healthcare, welfare, etc. There will always be more grave issues, but if we are always focusing on the grave issues, we might be blind to long term changes that literally change what it means to be an American and in the land of the \*free\* and the home of the brave.",1,1,1444715668,1444722657

cvxr5yf,0,t1_cvxq05u,slccsoccer28,"> So are you suggesting that every politician needs to release all of their private emails?

If they are related to gov't business that we the people are paying them to do - then yes.  It does not necessarily need to be publicly - but they should at the very least be released to a gov't oversight entity. After all, that's kind of the whole point of the gov't running emails servers - so they have control over the information that goes through them.",1,1,1444705940,1444722657
cvxqc7f,0,t1_cvxpp65,slccsoccer28,"> At the time, NONE of the emails were classified, they were marked accordingly later (when in the hands of the government). 

This is exactly the reason why I think it was such a bad idea.  A gov't official (especially a high-ranking gov't official) should be aware of risks like this. Just because a piece of information wasn't classified at the time it was sent or received, doesn't mean it won't be in the future.  

You can argue the legality of it all you want, but IMO this is a case of something that you can do, but shouldn't. It was reckless and an extremely stupid thing for a high ranking politician to do. I know she's a good politician, but her use of this server seemed to suggest a deep lack of technological understanding and I am extremely worried about how that will reflect on topics like privacy and Net Neutrality.

Thank you for that link, but that doesn't address my point that me and you (or perhaps anybody) will ever know if those are truly all of the emails. We do know that they deleted some emails and the FBI had to recover those. Why were they deleted?  Why could the FBI recover them, but she couldn't seem to have them available for release.

It's all kind of like leaving your car unlocked all of the time.  Perhaps 99% of the time you'll never have an issues - but it only takes one time for someone to test the doors and steal the contents.",1,1,1444704611,1444722657

Technically yes, but there are also additional laws against that she may have broken. I.E. handling classified information.  It's one of those things that while you can technically do it, it seemed very, very unwise and is filtering with danger.

> she put the link to ~~all~~  **most** her emails on her official website for her supporters to read.

As far as I'm aware, she did not release all of the emails on her server (why would she) and we do not know exactly what she decided to reserve.

At the end of the day, her actions with her email server are not something I would expect from a top ranking gov't official.",1,1,1444702728,1444722657

1. No matter what, I think your keyboard is the most important tool.  Get a good one. A lot of people say mechanical keyboards are better and I tend to agree.

2. Avoid your mouse as much as possible.  Seriously, next time you go from keyboard to mouse and back, make a note of how long it takes - I bet it's between 2 and 5 seconds. If you can learn the shortcuts of your program, you will be much better off.

3. Expand the functionality of your keyboard.  On Mac, I use Karabiner. On Windows, I think AutoHotKey is similar.  I've seriously become 20-40% more efficient with these things

   * Disable your Caps Lock and change it to a more useful key. I prefer escape, but you could do something like ctrl - or just leave it blank as a modifier key. 
      * I keep my capslock via Right Shift + Caps Key - although I still rarely use it.

   * Use the caps lock key to map common functionality closer to your figures
      * Caps + Home Row = Symbol Key i.e Caps + ""J"" = &  (Seriously, you'll never want to go to your symbol row again)
      * Caps + Enter = ""=>""  (Perl programmer here)
      * Caps + \"" = ""_"" 
      * Caps + / = ""=""  (reaching for dash and equal with your pinky is now much less painful

   * Add arrow keys to your keyboard.  I've Caps + U, I, O, P => Left, Up, Down, Right Arrows.  This is probably my favorite as it make it extremely easy to scroll through AutoComplete Suggestions and jump to the next like to put that pesky semi-colon in.

That being said, I do not trust her one bit.  

The way she acts, the way she talks, the way she approaches just about everything makes me really uneasy. I don't trust that she doesn't she says things in public to save face then actually do the opposite in private.

I've done my best to reserve judgement about the whole email server fiasco, but the whole thing screams shady and the way she's handled it is even shadier. She either knew what she was doing was wrong or didn't. Either way, I can't see how it doesn't negatively impact her - she's either a criminal or she incompetent.
