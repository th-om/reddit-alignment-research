cvi09of,1,t3_3msxyf,filosophikal,"I only dabble in composing so I may not express this with the proper vocabulary and this is ~~must~~ just my subjective impression. From a non-tonal perspective, I like the structures of your writing (complexities of rhythms and dynamics). The hard part for me is to take the structure of what I want to express and do it through the most interesting chord progressions and melody. 

I like the structure of Op. 9 No. 1. The beginning, with the dotted half note chords alternating with quarter note chords, then running down in triplets on the third iteration is a nice idea. In the ninth measure, the structure of the running 16th notes combined with the rhythm of the chords is a lovely increase in intensity. Yet, you can express these exact same structures with different chords and melodies leading to very different musical qualities. There were times that I could not tell if you made the best chord choice (the last two chords in measure 13 and the last chord in 19 are examples). My guess is that there is some difference between how you hear or think of it in your head and how you know how to express it in writing. There were also times when I thought you did well. I loved the sound of measures 29-32 and 33-39 were enjoyable. The structure and sound of 55-56 is lovely . Op. 9 No. 1 has very interesting complexities of structure that may be punctuated by non-optimal chord and melody choices.

I noticed that your Op. 8 No. 4 was had a simpler structure (non-tonally) and had a satisfying tonality (using I-V-I) but what about your chord choices at the ends of measures 7 and 13? There seemed to be something less satisfying there. (my subjective thought not a theory analysis)

More study of how chords relate to keys, scale positions, writing melodies over chord progressions, and some ear training will help. I have the problem where I know what I want to express, but it sounds different when I write, or when I write I must compromise due to my limited theoretical vocabulary. For me, this is a result of a lack of enough theoretical understanding combined with a not so great ear. It is much easier for me to get the actual structure of what I want to express in terms of its rhythmic play than to put that structure to the right chords and melody. If your dissatisfaction is more with the difference between what you imagined to how it sounds (as opposed to the non-tonal structural complexities of the music), then ear training and more theoretical knowledge of the best harmonic and melodic options available will be a big help. 

Overall I get the impression that you have a much richer musical imagination than your theory can express in writing. 

My writing suffers from the fact that what I wanted to express was dampened by my lack of ability to make the best chord and melodic choices in writing. 

You can hear samples here:

My future goal is to develop a better theory vocabulary and a better ear so I can immediately express my ideas in the right way. I want to avoid compromising the richer musical ideas in my head through my limited theory vocabulary when it comes time to write.

cvhy3w5,0,t1_cvhxsci,filosophikal,"Yes. My current posture of thought is on the idea that morality cannot exist except when we are focused on the life affirming potential of other beings. It does not exist in a self only vacuum. If I wind up accepting Melete's point of view, this idea will render an odd result. There are long lasting perspectives in religion and philosophy that assert it is the goal of human development to enlarge our sense of self. Our sense of self should not end at the end of our nose, but expand to include family, society, the whole world. Principles such as ""love your neighbor as yourself"" or the idea that a Bodhisattva loves all beings as if each one was his only child, paint a picture of increasing moral integrity as correlating with an expanding sense of self. 

If it is true that morality does not exist in actions conducted within the boarders of our own sense of self (in isolation from any sense of the other), then it follows that the ultimate moral evolution of a human being (to the extent that it enlarges their sense of self to include all humanity) has the ironic result of eliminating morality. A human being, who can perfectly express loving all others as themselves, would be an amoral being.

I am not saying this is actually the case. It is just where my thoughts are currently focused regarding morality. I believe Melete and I will be writing up something on this in the near future. It is something I want to think about and express in more detail.

cvhxgoc,0,t1_cvhck4l,filosophikal,"I wrote the article you referenced. I was just having this conversation with my coauthor (different essay) yesterday about if morality and ethics can exist in isolation from social contexts. It is important to recognize that Socrates and Plato were very focused on the concept of wrongdoing in the context of being a citizen. Although you harm yourself by wrongdoing, the idea of doing wrong was typically considered by Socrates in social contexts. In Socrates' thought, the typical scenario is that the harm of doing wrong comes back to self, but the wrong is directed against others. Socrates was very interested in the ideal of being a just citizen. The very idea of justice requires a social/political context. 

I am still thinking about where the conversation with Melete (pseudonym of the coauthor of most of the writing on my site) went to. So far, we are considering that the only context where moral right and wrong exists is in the context of our relatedness with others. Melete insisted that the only time morality exists is when we are in the act of considering the life affirming potential of another being. Since ethics is about our capacity to reason about morals, this limit would also apply to ethics.  

I still have a lot of thinking to do about this.",2,0,1443521704,1444725066
