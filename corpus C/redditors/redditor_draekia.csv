cvxrb50,0,t1_cvx9jg7,draekia,">I had to learn how to study at 14-15 and had to redo a whole year because of that.

Wow, makes me feel lucky that I only found that problem in college, and only failed 1 class that term. I whipped myself into gear and got through fine, but I also followed the mediocre advice of following my passion... ... which led me down the road of social sciences that haven't paid much (also, unpaid internships were not an option when  I was younger due to money, so yay!). Your experience sounds much tougher, and you're likely better off because of it!

I wish someone had beat it into my head to focus elsewhere, but then I also wouldn't have had the experiences that make me me. ",1,0,1444706173,1444717424

Unless you seriously believe that a higher power makes the call (many people do) there, there isn't really a difference between us consciously and unconsciously making the decision to abort a potential homo sapiens.",1,1,1444702894,1444717424

Whoosh?

I agree with your second point, but you just iterated exactly what the poster above you was arguing -- but from the opposite side. Why?",1,1,1444702718,1444717424
cvxlml2,0,t1_cvxiroq,draekia,"Which you are taking part in here, as well, by simply ignoring the the fact that the poster above used the term ""murder"" where they were really referring to death.

Getting caught up in word choice and choosing not to listen to the other side is the problem, really.",1,1,1444697313,1444717424
cvxlkn2,0,t1_cvx8fsg,draekia,"That's a rather bold assumption to say that ""it's fairly reasonable to assume that making abortion illegal (and consequently less safe) would decrease the number of abortions."" That is really backed up only by hope, instead of any data. 

Women have been having abortions since, well, forever, and will continue -- there will simply be worse statistics.

Also, this line sounded rather short-sighted:

>it is more just for the women to die because they chose to take the risks that killed them

Because the fetus will die anyway here, so it sounds more like justifying the neglect if not indirect double-murder of two by eliminating the safe way to consciously induce something that the body chooses to do, all by itself, all the time.",1,1,1444697230,1444717424

cvwuds5,0,t1_cvwtlns,draekia,"> Animating it will cost more than a live action tho but they must just bite the bullet and do it anyways, I am sure they will make more than enough money back.


Why would animating it cost more than live action? Especially if they outsource the animation to studios in Korea/etc?",4,0,1444653165,1444717424
