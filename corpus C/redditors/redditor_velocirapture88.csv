Also I don't see how an other countries embassy doing something that turned out to be a good idea in hindsight makes Clinton criminally negligent. Again my point was that Clinton, Rice, and Powell were all just victims of circumstance. You assigned blame to Clinton while absolving the others effectively making yourself a hypocrite. I don't believe in conspiracies so all the embassy attacks just seem like bad things happening to good people. You're the one assigning guilt. ",1,0,1442279653,1444729230

cv1t89s,0,t1_cv1sekg,velocirapture88,I studied History in college and spend a lot of time reading about policy. If knowing History is considered liberal talking points that's more of an issue with non liberals than me I think. ,0,0,1442278759,1444729230
cv1t5gx,0,t1_cv1sekg,velocirapture88,"No I'm well aware of what is happening on bith sides politically and policy wise. 

Like I said earlier I'm not that tech savvy and am not particularly familiar with computers. All I wanted to know was how exactly Government email worked or how using multiple servers work. Instead this became a partisan pissing contest over Benghazi. Luckily for me a couple of people actually answered my question. 

I don't see why it's so hard to understand that I am well aware of what is happening in the news but not completely familiar with all the intricacies of servers and computers. ",0,0,1442278631,1444729230
cv1e0ar,0,t1_cv1dlak,velocirapture88,"""The committee released a copy of a diplomatic cable written by Stevens on the day he died in which he catalogued concerns about rising violence and Islamist influence in eastern Libya but did not specifically ask for more protection."" - The Washington Post

 Here is a link to the article I pulled that quote from. 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/state-dept-downgraded-security-in-libya-before-deadly-attack-ex-officer-claims/2012/10/10/d7195faa-12e6-11e2-a16b-2c110031514a_story.html

So since Stevens didn't even ask for more protection the day of his death I doubt Clinton ignored him. And even if she had (she didn't) do you really think she wanted him to die? Even from the most cynical perspective that would be bad for her future ambitions. More than likely it was just a tragic attack.

Next time you accuse Hillary Clinton of ignoring calls for extra security make sure you can back up your position. ",1,0,1442254396,1444729230
cv1dlak,0,t1_cv1d7bh,velocirapture88,Also please back up your assertion that Clinton personally denied requests for additional security with multiple reputable sources. If this is true you should have no problem backing up your claims. Good luck.,2,0,1442253757,1444729230
