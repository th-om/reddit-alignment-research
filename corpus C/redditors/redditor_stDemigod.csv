cvuucw7,0,t1_cvusexp,stDemigod,"Have you ever attended a single class in biology? You introduce a different race into the argument when we are talking about men and women. 

You also talk about inverting cause and effect when you are the one doing it. Natural ability to perform comes before socially or culturally acquired skills. I dont know where you get your knowledge from but its absolute shit. 

Women can not overcome their natural inferiority by social or cultural means if the male puts the same effort into it. The gap is significant and the result of thousands of years of evolution. They are biologically inferior, you do understand what that means, right? Their brains are not as developed, they have a smaller surface area, smaller brain in general. Their cognitive skills are lower in general.

Now I feel like an idiot for pointing that out because its blatantly obvious, but females are also no match for males physically. They can train as hard as they want, they will never perform as good as best male athletes.

Now for your argument with a different race: The white race is indeed in part physically inferior to the black race. Ever asked yourself why all top olympic sprinters are black? 

On the other hand you wont find many black males that excell in fields that require high intellect. Why do you think there are only a very few highly regarded black scientists? Its because the white race is naturally more intelligent. 

On that note, did you ever ask yourself why you never see black women in science, why black women underperform almost everywhere, even athletically? Its because they are women and black, which means the worst of all worlds. Well, not really, technically being female and part of the Australoid race puts you in the worst spot, but you get my point.

I just answered the other guy saying the same shit. Are you guys seriously unaware of who gets money when there is war? Let alone power? Influence?

Do you even know how your economy works? Where money comes from? Fucking ridiculous talking to 15 year olds who lack basic knowledge about one of the most fundamental systems we all use every day. Get educated.",-7,0,1444477237,1444718876

You do realize that ever since the Iron Curtain fell the US presented the worst monsters in the world it has to go to war against to use its overblown military power?

First it was Saddam who took babies out of incubators to kill them, then it was Milosovic who build concentration camps like the Nazis, then Gaddafi was the biggest threat to international peace because he wanted nukes, then it was Saddam again. 9/11 comes around and it should be Saudi Arabia but its Afghanistan instead. Then its Saddam again for whatever bullshit reason, then its Qaddafi getting some again, even after being the Good Guy for quite some years, then Assad is the most oppressive dictator in the world, dont forget the Russians not being cool with the US lead coup in the Ukraine and finally the reincarnation of evil, monsters only hell could spawn. ISIS. Made possible and propped up by the US to destabilize the region and to target Iran the Jihadis did exactly what they were supposed to do. 

You dont see ISIS attacking any US ally. They are not targeting Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey. They just happen to do exactly what is in the best interest of the US and ""accidentally"" get their training by the CIA, frequent ""accidental"" weapon shipments, get a free pass on the drone strikes(Yemen was bombed far more than the IS, also to support the Saud invasion), etc.

Dude, if you would stand in court and tell the judge it was all just incompetence and you somehow ended up making all the cash and everything working out in your interest, you would be found guilty non the less.

Cui bono?

There is only one winner of all this mess and its the US who happens to ""accidentally"" play a leading role in the rise of ISIS. Pure coincidence, right?

""B-But the propaganda says otherwise!""

Yeah. The same propaganda outlets that told you Saddam has WMDs, Milosevic has concentration camps, the Taliban are responsible for 9/11. 

Your sources are even bigger lying pieces of shit than the usual conspiracy websites.",-6,0,1444473133,1444718876
cvunrcs,0,t1_cvunjgi,stDemigod,">On May 27, 2013, McCain slipped across the Turkish border to spend a few hours in Syria with members of the Free Syrian Army.

Please understand, the FSA consists of ISIS, Al Qaeda, Al Nusra, whatever. There is no ""moderate"" islamic terrorism. The article you posted is the very definition of a propaganda piece to try and shield someone from the consequences of his actions.

Same goes for that IS intercepted air drops. They frequently get US care packages and all of these were interceptions? You seriously believe that the most advanced, technically sophisticated, simply the best military in the world constantly fucks up delivering air drops to the Kurds and gives them to ISIS instead? 

Are you a conspiritard that thinks the US military is a bunch of inept retards?

Turkey has. Has my ass. Turkey is. And no, they didnt played devils advocate, they chose their side and stayed with it. Even their anti IS operation is just a disguise to bomb the Kurds.

Same goes for the US training effort. You really think that the CIA is a bunch of dumb asses who train John Jihad and didnt know he lied about his affiliation when he signed up?

How do you get through your life thinking the government and its agencies are just idiots? Do you really think the US could do what it is doing while being as stupid as you make them look? You really think all these ""accidents"" are incompetence? Even when the frequently happen? When they are part of a strategy that was published years ago? When you got shit like Intelgate?

This has nothing to do with reading conspiracy websites, everyone with a working brain is calling bullshit by your claims. ",-10,0,1444471042,1444718876
