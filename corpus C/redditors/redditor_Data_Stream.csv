A guy (whom you've probably heard of) once told me something really insightful about pervy sex stuff - ""The problem isn't so much that it exists, the problem is that we tolerate it""
If you don't like it then don't engage in it, and don't support a site or an individual who does. Weird stuff will always exist, there's no stopping that, but we can make sure it's unwelcome in mainstream fandom.

.

EDIT: most pony conventions these days aren't allowing 18+ panels anymore, no vulgar or sexual material. I think that's a good thing, helps to keep that stuff relegated to fetish sites and out of the mainstream.",4,0,1418153688,1444730086

Could you manage a staff of hundreds of people? EDIT: also, I have no idea how much money is involved in a convention - more than I would know what to do with.

I couldn't, hell no. I barely keep track of my own bank account.

But some of these event organizers think that it couldn't possibly be that hard. They've went to a lot of conventions, so they think they could probably run a convention",3,0,1410965839,1444730086
ckkuz1q,0,t1_ckkqx2m,Data_Stream,"(I don't mean to advertise but) [I run a podcast](http://thebronycast.podbean.com/) and we talk to event organizers and fandom news sites all the time - and they say the very same thing.

It's oversaturation, there's just way too much of it. Even fans of this stuff need to admit that it's just one show.

We probably won't see pony conventions go away for a very long time, but they are already starting to consolidate and the smaller ones are disappearing.

.

Back when the fandom first really blew up, some of the smaller conventions ran on a shoestring budget with half of the staff that they needed - and some of them were amazing despite that. Really captured the fandom's seemingly unlimited energy at the time.

And it was a miracle that those events didn't fall apart, some were held together with scotch tape.

I went to Canterlot Gardens in 2012 and it was the best convention I've ever been to for anything. It was at the height of the fandom, they had the best guests at the peak of their interest in the fans. - - - and it was on a razor's edge of complete disaster. Nothing happened, but one incident could have ruined the whole thing.

.

Well things are different now. People trying to run cons who just don't have enough experience with this stuff.",7,0,1410965475,1444730086
