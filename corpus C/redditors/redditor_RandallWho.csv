No.

>An addictive personality? 

No

>Any issues controlling/managing meds in the past?

Other then not being able to stay on them due to the side effect being to much, no.

>Or, can you keep yourself from taking more than prescribed, consistently using no more than prescribed..?

Yes as long as its working.

Thats the rub, tho' do any of the suggestions build up tolerance over time so that you have to take more?

I am really interested in both categories either way.",1,0,1444623919,1444725325

cvvb8np,1,t3_3o9ljp,RandallWho,"So we had a cat that had chronic uti complete with crystals...we followed the doctors advice and treated him and gave him the Hills Science Diet Urinary along with what ever medication he was on. We also made a switch to DI water and wet cat food as opposed to dry cat food.

We haven't had any more problems since.

So in addition to following the the vets reconditions switch to DI water and when he is better keep him on wet cat food.

Also you might need to start an amazon list of a gofundme page.
