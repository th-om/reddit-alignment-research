But I guess will see if the GOP can scare me into voting for the lesser of the two evils. With Hilary, at least I know I'm getting someone who can maintain international relationships.

cvxtieh,0,t1_cvxbs4r,attosama,"Your post didn't inherently say what's wrong with a democratic socialism. Aren't Medicare, Social Security, and Welfare all forms of socialism that have done great good for our society as a whole? Sastistically it seems to cost taxpayers a whole lot less to take care of those in need, then to jam them into the ER. ",1,0,1444710260,1444718928
cvxtaaz,0,t1_cvxig4n,attosama,"You got all that from Sanders letting an outraged back teenager speak at his podium? Understandably people were upset, but he walked away and came back bigger at his next rally, adding more focus on the issues of discrimination. 

The issues your debunking however are not free things, people are paying into a larger system to reduce the costs of living, it's insurance. If you pay your taxes then you see that money put to good use. 

What things in particular upset you? I am up for a reasonable debate to explain why I explain my thoughts. 

Just to clear biases up, I'm a young white adult making more than $40K a year, I have great health insurance, and everything I own has been paid out of my own pocket. So the ideas I support do not impact me, but I understand I got to where I am today with opportunities not readily available to those in poverty, and I want to help reduce class inequality.

cvwomfd,1,t3_3oew6s,attosama,"I have this gut feeling the first debate being held by CNN is going to ask soft ball questions that do little to rally the other candidates, or intentionally keeps Hilary the focus of the evening...

cvwltsc,0,t1_cvwlni4,attosama,"I can't refute this, you did your research and I have to agree that I was being overly sensitive and unfair to Ben Carson in regard to the above. 

However I still feel this his remarks lack sensitivity, and asking people to sacrifice themselves is not a solution for gun violence. ",1,0,1444623419,1444718928

cvwk2i7,0,t1_cvwjto1,attosama,"In wake of the recent school shooting he said he would have 'had the students rush the gunman, because he can't shoot everyone', and regarding the robbery 'he redirected the gunman's attention to the cashier after having a gun pulled on him'. 

These not ideas or stories of a courageous man. His most stunning remark was that he thought the Jews should have fought harder in wake of the Nazi Party. ",1,0,1444619960,1444718928
cvwjs4o,0,t1_cvwiggu,attosama,"I don't know that for certain, but my point still stands that twice now he's managed to paint himself as a coward, because he's so out of touch with reality he doesn't seem to understand that using others as a meat shield doesn't get you a round of a applause.

I could care less about whether he was robbed or not, I'm focused on how clueless he is that he doesn't seem to understand why people would be mad at him for his remarks regarding the holocaust, having people rush a gun man, and redirecting a gunman toward another fellow citizen.
