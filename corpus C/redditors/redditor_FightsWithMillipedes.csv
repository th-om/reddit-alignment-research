Maybe they have a scale of punishment that they operate off of to keep the town in check. In this case, a 5 would be getting your fucking house burned down. But I could be way off base.

csejgbr,0,t1_csehhhj,FightsWithMillipedes,"I was surprised at how much I got into it. My biggest fear was the change in setting.
