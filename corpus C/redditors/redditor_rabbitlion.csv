cvxjp70,0,t1_cvxa7pk,rabbitlion,"The legal process and appeals certainly cost a lot, but that's not the extra $90k they talk about here.

""Normal"" prisoners are kept in huge groups with few guards and are shuffled between areas in groups. They're also made to perform various tasks almost entirely without compensation. Death row prisoners have private cells and there are more guards, and I guess the routines are different too. 

The $90k figure might come from [this article](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty) which is about california, but the costs should be similar I suppose. Another interesting fact from that article; since the death penalty was reinstated in 1978 California has spent en extra ~$4B on convicting people to death instead of prison, and has executed 13 persons. The cost per execution is more than 300 million dollars.",9,0,1444694258,1444731398

cvx2dgd,0,t1_cvwz71w,rabbitlion,"I would go for SE of grand mesa on the stone. This will give you access to the oasis plus two wheat and a deer. As someone else said, the current location has way too little food to ever work a reasonable number of tiles.

Also it's questionable if you should care that much about the double wonder. Grand Mesa is decent but it doesn't even compare to an improved marble/silver tile, while Barringer Crater is quite an awful wonder. It's really only worth it for the 4 faith but working that 0 food 0 production tile really hurts a city.",2,0,1444668387,1444731398
cvx0szx,0,t1_cvx00fy,rabbitlion,"> Those companies then made a ""loan"" to Michael (so it's not income), which he would spend, and the company would write off as ""bad debt"".

This doesn't sound like a legal construct at all as it would be fairly trivial to abuse.

>They worked out how much profit Starbucks UK had made, and at the end of the year sent out an invoice for that year's worth of coffee that just happened to match their profit figures. Starbucks UK paid the bill, and successfully off-shored all their profit to Switzerland (where corporation tax is lower).

You could certainly do this, but generally it's easier to just do it via royalties. Basically have the Swiss company own the Starbucks brand and the UK company pays a fee for being allowed to use the name and brand.",2,0,1444665928,1444731398

cvwxaou,0,t1_cvwvih6,rabbitlion,"That's exactly what someone who was planning on stealing my accounts would say.

On a more serious note, the problem with your Terms of Service is that my only recourse if you break them is to sue you. Not only do I not have the time or means to do so, it's also likely that you are more or less judgment proof. When I download a program backed by a larger company they have more to lose by doing shady things. I can feel comfort in the fact that is they screw up badly some lawyer till take the time to sue them for many millions. Overwolf on the other hand, I know nothing about. For all I know, it could have been created with the specific purpose of getting an executable onto as many computers as possible and then doing something shady. Please understand that this is not a personal criticism of you.

The second issue is that even if I trust your integrity, you are also asking me to trust your competence. Overwolf could open up security holes, especially in the plug-in and advertising modules. Even if you are not trying to do something shady, someone else could find a way to abuse the program to execute code on my computer. Additionally, if you make a mistake it could mean me getting banned from the game.",-6,0,1444659940,1444731398
cvwwjnl,0,t1_cvww91t,rabbitlion,It's worth noting that facebook employees in the UK still pays the normal taxes on their wages (or facebook pays them). This low figure just refers to corporate taxes which is based on the company's profits. As facebook uk doesn't have any profits they pay no taxes.,16,0,1444658447,1444731398
