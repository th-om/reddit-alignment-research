cvwzyrj,1,t3_3odjl2,savagemoonlight,"Hey People, i try to get back into football but I have no idea where to start.

About me:

I am a 27 years old male from Berlin, Germany. When I was younger. I actually was into soccer a lot. That was during the Bergkamp/Figo/Beckahm/Zidane days. I never really supported a team but kind of followed Arsenal, Real Madrid and Hertha BSC

Lost track of football for a while since I am usually more into NBA basketball and right now I can not find a way to get back in.

My Knowledge of football is still from about the 2004 time and I have no Idea what happend in the 11 years since (well apart from Euro Cup and World Cup).

So here are my questions:

What is my best bet to catch up? Are there any reliable (english/german) news sources I should follow closely?

Is there a source for statistics comparable to basketball-reference.com?

I dont have TV at home, so I can not watch football on free TV. What would be a good source for national/international highlight reels and full game streaming?

A litle friendly banter: Why does your subreddit look so... standard?

Thanks in advance

Power over skill, hyped to hell long before he'd ever won a playoff game (or even played in the NBA), cries and flops as much as Chris Paul but isn't called out for it half as much, and then there's his legion of idiot fans who think he's better than a bunch of all-time greats (to be fair, he is better than some of them) despite his absolutely awful Finals record. Despite the guy's obvious ability and work ethic, he comes off as entitled. I guess having ESPN basically call you the next Jordan from your junior year onward warps your personality just a bit.",5,0,1444155468,1444726144

cvqbjud,0,t1_cvp9l1o,savagemoonlight,"It's kind of a moving target right now. I'm out as bi-gender at work, family and friends. I rarely dress all female when I'm out and about, just in safer spaces and home. But in all other times I try to express myself as close as I can to where my identity on any given day. At work I pretty much dress and put on makeup however I want. I'm not really planning on medically transitioning (maybe low dose HRT at some point)  so fully expressing the female side is still a work in progress, but everything else is pretty good.",1,0,1444153934,1444726144
cvq4cii,1,t3_3nn0xy,savagemoonlight,"Last year my girlfriend broke up with me 2 weeks into my junior year of college, it sucked. Then the Knicks were just awful and I was sure that my outlet for a bonded experience with a sports team was done for the year. The next few weeks were pretty shit, bad sex, bad grades, no friends, just depression manifested, it's pretty shocking how quickly you can go from a semblance of stability to shattered in a moment. One morning I woke up early after dreaming about my ex and needed to get out of my dirty room and breath the frigid November northeast air to get my head straight. Trolling around reddit I stumbled across r/soccer and started to run through the top posts of all time. It wasn't before long that I watched some of the famous CP vs. LIV match and it clicked. I remembered my father telling me I guess 3 years ago about Crystal Palace being promoted, he is from Croydon and my Grandmother lived there until she passed 8 years ago, it is a place I have visited many times and feel a personal connection to. That was the weekend I began my romance with the EPL, I was lucky enough to have a real personal connection to a team and I was hooked. Finishing the week and knowing that I was going to be woken up by my alarm with the fresh morning sky telling me it was time to be engulfed by football for the next few hours. There is truly no other sports league like this in the world, it feels like there is so much on the line every second of the game, the distinction between a victory and loss can often be so minuscule that losses can truly break your spirit for a day, or make it a day where a victory has just boosted you until you fall asleep. It was such a welcome distraction from my real romantic situation and learning more about the game of football and it's history helped instilled a new understanding of passion in me, what it means to work for yourself in order to make yourself a great player or person. It's been a year since I began following CPFC and I can't describe the emotions I have felt being a fan of this club, I am truly in love. It is a small part but I can definitely credit Crystal Palace as well as the EPL as a whole for helping me get out of that funk I was in and boost me back into a swaggerish and awesome approach to life. SEE YOU IN OCTOBER SELHURST PARK!",3,0,1444143051,1444726144
