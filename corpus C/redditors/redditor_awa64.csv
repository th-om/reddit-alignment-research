cvx8qjf,0,t1_cvx12s5,awa64,"TV stopped ""mattering"" when WWF no longer had a competitor with a comparable budget or comparable national TV deal. That meant they could ease off on competing for ratings (assuming they would absorb the entire wrestling audience... and largely correct, although the overall audience for wrestling shrunk as a result too) and return to using TV to build to profitable PPV events—it's not like they were getting paid a bonus for delivering higher ratings, although lower ratings do have an impact on renegotiating the TV deal every time it comes up for renewal.

And it takes 3 PPVs to finish a feud because, realistically, WWE is building to four PPVs a year—Wrestlemania, Money in the Bank, SummerSlam, and the Royal Rumble. Everything else is fungible, and if they can stick someone in a 3 month holding pattern, that's fine, it makes their job as bookers easier.",2,0,1444677665,1444718554

> A Republican with a unique health care plan that removes the individual mandate, but keeps popular aspects of the law, would be hard to run against.

OK, so how do you make a health care plan that still solves the ""insurance companies spending billions of dollars to prove something was a pre-existing condition so they don't have to pay for it"" problem without using an individual mandate to make sure people don't wait to sign up for insurance until they're sick/injured?

That's really the problem. Obamacare is already the conservative, free-market-friendly health care reform proposal. Any other solution is going to be further left-wing, either public option or single-payer. That's why the calls to ""repeal and replace"" never included any details about the ""replace"" part of that process.",14,0,1444622395,1444718554

I'm pretty sure the people working on the roads already *are* private companies. The government hires low-bid contractors to do road maintenance. Who do you think is going to pay to maintain the roads if not the government? 

I mean, sure, you'd have large businesses like oil companies and Walmart with a stake in making sure they all worked, but they'd want to make sure the other, smaller businesses nearby chipped in,  and average people, and of course you'd need a bunch of different people in charge based on geographic areas because it's too big a job to plan centrally. Working across all those groups, they'd need to come to some kind of agreement, some kind of... elected board, deciding how to use the funds they gather and managing the logistics of maintaining the roads.

I wonder what you'd call an organization like that.

> USP is actually superior to the shitty USPS

I assume you mean UPS and not USP, and... well... if USPS is so shitty, why does UPS contract USPS to have them do last-mile delivery in unprofitable areas?

Also, if UPS is so superior to USPS, tell me... how much does sending a relatively-small physical object from Maine to Florida in two days cost via UPS? Because via USPS, it costs two quarters with change left over.

Any other private business would do 90-95% of their job, sure. Who's gonna handle the other 5-10% without price-gouging those people?
