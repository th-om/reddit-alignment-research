cvwhoqg,0,t1_cvwheas,Enturk,Airports cost several times that every year. We (the federal government) spend more than that just maintaining the asphalt on airport runways. [Source.](http://www.tcpilots.org/resource/AIPprogram.html) ,17,0,1444615688,1444716546

cvwhbah,0,t1_cvwguz5,Enturk,"Have you ever gotten on a train? You go get a ticket, and then get on the train within about 20 minutes. 

When I fly, the airlines recommend getting there at least an hour before take-off. And that's not including the trip to the airport. Train stations are in the middle of large cities, much easier to get to by more people. Most airports are well outside cities. I realize this may not be your experience, but it is the normal experience. The center of a city, where train stations usually are, is much better connected than an airport.

Now take this extra time, expense, and pollution, and double it, for departure and landing, and then double it again, for going both ways on a trip. For long trips, airplane is still faster, but for shorter ones, trains start looking good.

Now, if trains were much faster, as they would be for high-speed rail, trains start looking good even on medium trips.",12,0,1444615043,1444716546
cvwgzx0,1,t3_3oed8c,Enturk,"I don't think the serious proposals are to cover the US with tracks at any time in the near future. But for certain high-traffic, densely populated corridors, it might make sense. 

Also, airplanes are also limited to airports, which are an initial investment. I assume they cost less than laying rail, but I imagine that's a comparison that depends on the real estate and the airport.

Trains pollute less, I think, than planes carrying similar loads. And are cheaper to maintain, again, I think. And, despite requiring an initial investment, so did airports for airplanes. So it's not the initial cost that makes a project not worth consideration. And, given the greater efficiency of fuel consumption per cargo and lower maintenance costs, it would seem worth considering. I'm not the most informed guy about this, so you might be able to correct me on some of these.",21,0,1444614477,1444716546

cvwajf3,0,t1_cvwa84x,Enturk,"That's true, but SCOTUS and ""the law of the land"" was a complete joke back then. States did whatever they wanted: they each had their own currency, and the notion that the courts or legislature could provide a remedy for anything was something very few people took seriously. This isn't the case anymore. Agencies and governments tasked with a job who stray from that job are sued in court and lose. Things have changed dramatically.

More on point, the memo I linked above provides relatively solid ground for a convention that is tasked with one task being limited to doing that task. Check it out.",1,0,1444602713,1444716546
