In the context of this discussion, tax brackets are pointless. Marginal rates are pointless. Effective rates are what matters. And those rates aren't nearly as progressive as the marginal rates.

cvxa2jc,0,t1_cvx8zjh,IUhoosier_KCCO,"> US top income tax rate: ~~39.6~~ 20.3

[FTFY](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=456). let's use effective rates, since those are the ones that actually matter. not sure exactly how norway's taxes work. is the effective rate for top earners about the same as the statutory rate?

> In the US, we tax corporations at ~~35~~27% federally, and up to 12% locally, while in Norway they are taxed at 27%.

[FTFY](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41743.pdf). scroll to page 3 of the report. my same question about norway's personal income tax applies to this as well. 

do you mind explaining why you are using marginal tax rates instead of effective tax rates? you realize that if a corporation falls in the 35% tax bracket that NOT all of their income gets taxed at 35%, right?

> Also, I wasn't replying to you, so IDK why the need to take offense. Not only that, I was turning the exact same circlejerky comment on its head to make it obvious how circle jerky it was.

it was more of a preemptive thing. but the anti-sanders circle jerk is exactly what you just described that you did. i'm just pointing out it is just as annoying and doesn't add anything to the discussion.

but actually, it seems that your understanding of the US tax system is not as strong as you make it out to be. it turns out that the US tax system may be *less* progressive than the nordic countries.",0,0,1444679572,1444717143

i meant that it is a service that comes with the financial assistance. it is almost like a probation officer. maybe even give the planner the power to impose sanctions or something if the person receiving assistance is not handling money well. these are just spitball ideas.",2,0,1444677539,1444717143

can you please rewrite?

does his funding plan assume trading volume doesn't decrease? if so, can you cite that?

who is they? /u/spaceghoti was responding to OP. OP simply asked questions and didn't point out any flaws.

i don't consider that to be a sanders circle jerk comment. don't let that be a ringing endorsement of the comment though. again, not too concerned what others say. just pointing out both circle jerks are equally annoying.

but why don't you let me handle who i respond to and who i don't. thanks.",-3,0,1444677266,1444717143
cvx83zo,0,t1_cvx7coj,IUhoosier_KCCO,"> With the continuing growth of welfare, something has to be done to make those that are able care for themselves. We absolutely should not slash welfare, but we absolutely cannot continue on our present trajectory.

that's a very rational and reasonable stance to take. although we might disagree on the degree to which there is abuse in the system, it is difficult to argue that there isn't at least some abuse. 

any organization has abuse (whether it be government or private). there is a certain level of abuse that we need to be ok with if we want to be realistic. we are never going to be able to get abuse to 0. it is simply impossible.

what are your thoughts on requiring all students to take a personal finance class or 2 before graduating high school. this class could delve into budgeting, family planning, how to save money, and many other topics. do you think that would go a long way in addressing any abuse? if not, what do you think should be done? maybe requiring financial counselling when on welfare?

cvx7vh3,1,t3_3oh768,IUhoosier_KCCO,"it depends on what you mean by ""work?"" if bernie was able to pass everything he wants to without changing much, then i do think they would accomplish the goals they intend to. i would classify that result as ""working,"" but others certainly wouldn't.

now to be realistic, he doesn't have a chance in passing much of what he has proposed. that doesn't really matter to me. if he were able to pass just a couple of his major policy ideas, i would consider that a success. the hope is that he can use the bully pulpit to actually get people excited about a government that works for them. in the best-case scenario, he gets enough done during his first 2 years that get people excited enough to vote in a congress that can actually work with him. 

it seems that your definition of ""work"" is that he'll be able to fund all of these policy proposals. every single policy proposal i've seen so far has come with a realistic way of funding it. so, in that sense, his plans would work. i'm sure that you'll get some people arguing that his tax plans wouldn't fully fund his ideas. i guess that is why economics isn't a hard science.",2,0,1444676408,1444717143
