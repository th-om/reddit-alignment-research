cvwnmq3,1,t3_3odn4q,elizabeth90125,"Iran performs more GRS than any country other than Thailand. This version of Islam accepts that people are transgender, but not homosexual. More importantly, they have a Islamic rationale that makes it ok. I don't enough about Islam to say what exactly it is, but they make it all fit in.",5,0,1444627824,1444721232

cvmfmix,1,t3_3n8mbk,elizabeth90125,"Yes, there is a big difference. My opinion is treated as irrelevant or stupid around men. Wasn't this way when I was living my life as a male. Everything I say now seems to be treated with a different level of regard. It was kind of strange at first how men would just talk over me as if I weren't speaking and think nothing of interrupting or cutting me off. I also noticed that in public spaces men expect women to yield them the right of way. And i don't mean driving. I mean if a man and a woman are approaching together in what would be a collision, men just expect that the woman will stop and give them the right of way. 

So yeah, definitely have a better understanding of ""male privilege"".",1,0,1443842175,1444721232
cvmfgrt,1,t3_3n7ool,elizabeth90125,"First, I am very sorry for your loss and can only imagine how you must feel. I feel much the same way as this lovely lady you describe and I hope when I die I am not remembered as someone that was transgender, but as someone that refused to live as a victim. You have made the feel the same about your significant other. Sounds to me like she was a strong person that was very tender inside, but didn't want to live as a victim. May your fondest memories of her always stay vibrant.",2,0,1443841803,1444721232
cvmdfqm,1,t3_3nal7p,elizabeth90125,"Because interest rates are at an abnormally low level and have been for ten years now in an attempt to elevate economic activity. However failure to raise those rates means the economy can still only operate in basically 0% interest rates. This makes the bond market not very lucrative and artificially inflates equities (Stocks) making investors have to pay more to make money in stocks. Basically American and Multi-National corporations can't seem to turn a profit without this free money. This means stagnant growth with no end in sight. And if we drop back into recession we can't lower interest rates any more to spur economic activity. So our economy will be stuck in low gear, just like Japan's has been for the last 25 years.",1,0,1443837271,1444721232
cvmcn84,1,t3_3nai2x,elizabeth90125,"There is fission which is considered to be the ""atom bomb"". There is fission boosting where deuterium and or tritium is included in the fission which makes extra neutrons available to create more fission, hence ""boosting"" the yield. These were called ""thermo-nuclear"" devices. The hydrogen bomb is a fusion bomb triggered by a fission bomb. And all of them belong to the bigger more general group we call nuclear bombs.",1,0,1443835552,1444721232
cvljw9o,0,t1_cvljm8r,elizabeth90125,"No, again what I said was that the demarcation line is not race, it's money, lots and lots of money. Do you know any poor minorities that are Republican? Didn't think so. And like I said, I used to be a Republican. I voted for Reagan twice and Bush I once. Until I figured out the Republican promise was a huge lie. They cut taxes and caused record deficits at the expense of programs that help the poor. That is the real truth. The rich fear the poor, and with good reason, they have been lying to the poor since day one. You're the one posting racial stereotypes, not me.",0,0,1443785443,1444721232
cvljim9,0,t1_cvljg6j,elizabeth90125,"No, that is what you said. I said they don't represent the minorities they are members of. They represent the interests of the wealthy, because they are wealthy. Recent studies show that the richer people get, the less compassion they have. Check it out. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/10/rich-people-compassion-mean-money_n_1416091.html

Also, I am mixed race and definitely not racist.",0,0,1443784127,1444721232
cvlivlb,1,t3_3n7dfh,elizabeth90125,"The only reason to go slow is making the assumption one will regret it. That argument usually comes from a person that is against the transition. ""What's the hurry"", ""What if you're wrong"". Blah, blah, blah. When going from Los Angeles to Miami, most people don't go through Anchorage, Alaska because they are afraid they may get to their destination too fast. Not to say there is anything wrong with going slow and to an extent it's already slow enough. Go at the pace that suits you. That is all that really matters. ",1,0,1443781514,1444721232
