They weren't born there, didn't have major surgery etc. so they gave the NHS more than they took and it's the same with everything else paid from taxes (they got schooling at home, they mostly don't claim unemployment etc.)

cvurzcg,0,t1_cvurvt7,revee,Maybe it's a question of interpreting what an atheist actually means. For some people it's someone who simply doesn't believe and doesn't care beyond that. For others it means the condescending fedora guy verbally attacking others for their faith. I wouldn't want to work with that guy either (that's what the poll asks).,13,0,1444486645,1444723527

A camp in a neighboring country. And once the war is over, they go back. That's how it was for decades. Even those who made it to a 1st world country and got asylum there were only there for a limited time and then were sent back. This is how it was in Germany in the 90s too (the Balkans). Some people stayed because they learned the language, found jobs etc. Most didn't.

I am not even sure where this change started, suddenly these migrants are considered for life. They don't speak the language, are illiterate or severely undereducated, follow completely different set of moral principles, clashing religion... ",36,0,1444468053,1444723527
