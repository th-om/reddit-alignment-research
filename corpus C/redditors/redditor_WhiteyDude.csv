What other ways of learning about the nature of our world are there? I see this statement (or similar) being made all the time, but never does anyone actually describe another method.   ",10,0,1444689555,1444717854

cvx00en,0,t1_cvwz6tm,WhiteyDude,"> Trump isn't considered a serious candidate by anyone with any knowledge.

""They've"" been saying that for how many months now?   But besides Trump and Carson, everyone else is in single digits.  

And Carson is NOT a better candidate than Romney was.  Romney ran a business, the Olympics, Massachusetts.  Other than operating his own practice, Carson has only served on advisory boards.  He's never actually lead anything, and if you heard him in on NPR last week, you'd realize how completely clueless he is about how our government operates.  

>>And who's running the Republican majority congress? Nobody.

>I don't know what you mean by this.

It was kind of a big deal last week, the guy picked to replace Boehner backed out last minute and so far there's no sign that they've figured out who will be the next Speaker.
