It sounds like you don't consider what he did to be improper, while I consider it to be a very good example of legal-but-unethical cronyism. While I enjoy the fact that some of his money went to good causes, that doesn't mean he earned it properly (see John D. Rockefeller and his legacy for a tremendous dilemma along those lines). We disagree, which isn't the end of the world.",1,0,1444338185,1444727600
cvstszq,0,t1_cvsqzir,resurrectedlawman,"OK -- the dollars that flowed into his pocket directly were plainly limited (though it's interesting that they don't describe the amount of his deferred payments or his stock profits, which were about $500,000 and $6.9 million, respectively; nor the fact that he could keep the payments even if he did donate the stock profits; nor the fact that the charity he donated to was the Richard B Cheney Cardiac Institute, and guess whose image gets burnished by that one?). I would love to someday found and enrich a noble charity with my name all over it -- wouldn't you?

Let's be honest: if you served a company as its CEO, left on good terms (they gave him a massive golden parachute described as ""a fortune for a man with no previous experience in running a multinational company"" and awarded him early retirement even though he was too young to qualify), and were able to use the stock options to enrich a charity near and dear to your heart (pun intended), what do you think it would look like if you proceeded to make that company a shit-ton of money by using your government connections? I'm sure all his cronies were quite favorably impressed. I'm also wondering if any of them recommended that he sit on the board of directors of any other companies, which is a nice way to get money for doing very little other than making rich people feel that they owe you something. 

The question isn't whether Cheney wallows around in a pool of gold coins or donates them to a fund to erect a statue of himself; the question is whether he is corrupt and used his influence to benefit entities with whom he had a previous relationship (and from whom he could possibly expect to derive a reciprocal benefit).

cvsqlre,0,t1_cvsoi2c,resurrectedlawman,"I have money in a 401K. My 401K may or may not invest in, say, Coca-Cola. Do you honestly think that I am responsible for Coca-Cola's success or failure as much as its CEO is? Do you think I benefit from Coca-Cola's success as much as its CEO does? 

I think if we discovered that Coca-Cola's CEO took a government job and made decisions that directly resulted in government contracts going to Coca-Cola, and those decisions also happened to kill thousands of Americans and many thousands of foreigners, you and I would instantly agree that this CEO would have violated basic laws of conflict of interest, patriotism, and decency.

Look at Cheney's role in this company, and the decisions that were made to enrich it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliburton . He didn't just run this company for years; he directed significant amounts of government work toward it, especially after he became Vice President, and has benefited not only from direct compensation but also from stock options. Basically, they kept giving him cash and he already had the stock to keep making money from. 

You'll also see words like ""overcharging the Pentagon"" and ""agreed to plead guilty to charges that it destroyed evidence relating to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill"". This company is not a force for good in the world, and Cheney's influence with them is deep.",4,0,1444327641,1444727600

If they've made money, then he and his colleagues all profited directly from a decision he made that cost thousands of Americans their lives (and cost the taxpayers trillions of dollars). Again, I don't know the finances within Halliburton and the Carlyle Group, but it isn't hard to see how neoconservative politicians including Cheney had a tremendous amount to gain.",3,0,1444323701,1444727600
