Same reason they are ""afraid"" to debate the issue of gravity or helio-centrism or fake lunar landings: you can't reason someone out of something he was never reasoned into in the first place. In other words, it's a waste of time.",1,1,1444691329,1444720117

But there is no reason to get an ultra-light pack until you get your volume (and weight) down to a reasonable level.  

This is where I'm at right now. I could get a lighter stove/pot set up that would save me a few ounces, and I'm still lacking a really good lightweight sleeping bag which could save me maybe almost 2 pounds (at the likely cost of some sleeping comfort which I fear giving up).
