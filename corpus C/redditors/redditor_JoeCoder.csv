> if we had found out that humans and apes don't share DNA, it would have thrown the hypothesis out the window.

IOS and Android share a lot of code from open source libraries as well.  If God created humans and the various ape species separately, should he have used the best design in one organism and used inferior designs in the others, just for the sake of avoiding similarity?  Not that it's always that way.  We used to think Aardvarks, anteaters, and pangolis were closely related, but now genetics puts them in different orders.

> Fossils

I don't know what the fossil record shows, but I disagree that it supports evolutionary theory.

According to even ID critics like paleontologist Don Prothero, the fossil record [is](http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/12-02-15/#feature) ""one vast monument to stasis, with relatively few cases where anyone had observed gradual evolution"".  And according to [Eldredge and Tattersal](http://books.google.com/books?id=frwaAgAAQBAJ&q=%22The+fossil+record+simply+shows+that+this+prediction+is+wrong%22), ""Nor is the problem a miserably poor record.""  Prothero says the same in his own article.

The small number of proposed transition sequences have steps that are less similar than what you can build from what are supposed to be completely unrelated animals, like the [pangolins/aardvarks/anteaters](http://i.imgur.com/Uxt8kPz.jpg) or [canines and thylacines](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Beutelwolf_fg01.jpg).  With out-of-order finds like [this](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100106/full/news.2010.1.html) or [this](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44867222/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.T48vQbMw944) omitted so a sequence can still be built.

> chromosome #2... predicted and confirmed by evolution

I think humans once had 48 chromosomes and since then have had a merge.  To be evidence of common descent you would need to show the same merge in another ape species.

Instead of this argument, I think you need categories where evolution and design make opposite predictions.  For example, design predicts that living things will be very complicated and highly ordered, even though Darwin saw cells as simple blobs of goo.  Predicted and confirmed by design?

> viral remnants in our DNA

I think the evidence better supports the endogenous-first model, where most ERV's are original to genomes and exogenous retroviruses have emerged from them.  I wrote more about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/394z6j/why_do_so_many_christians_frown_upon_the_idea_of/cs0w7kl).

> How much ""junk"" DNA is predicted by evolution?

I particularly like the junk DNA argument because it's a place where design and evolution make opposite predictions.  A while ago I wrote [an article](http://notascientist.d512.com/worldview/biology/evolution/junk-dna/index.php) to summarize my own notes on the topic.  It includes various predictions from both sides, the reasons behind those predictions, and evidence for how much is functional.",1,0,1444582810,1444726164

It always seemed strange that so many people were radically against conversion therapy when there are a reasonable number of homosexuals that want to change.  Even if you have only very marginal success and it didn't work for a vast majority of people, and maybe even harmed some, a reasonable person would say ""Ok, let's explore this some more and see if it can be improved"" like we do in pharmaceuticals.

The current quest is to find a way to make evolution work, not disprove it.  Evolutionary theory is widely popular because many see any alternative to materialistic naturalism as ""not science"", as Margulis says above.

I like the way Penn Jillette, who is an atheist, [explains it](https://youtu.be/6md638smQd8?t=2m58s):

1.  ""If you believe that there's a heaven and hell and people could be going to hell or not getting eternal life or whatever, and you think that it's not really worth telling them this because it would make it socially awkward, and atheists who think that people shouldn't proselytize -- 'Just leave me alone, keep your religion to yourself.'  How much do you have to hate somebody to not proselytize?  How much do you have to hate somebody to believe that everlasting life is possible and not tell them that? If I believed beyond a shadow of a doubt that a truck was coming at you and you didn't believe it, and that truck was bearing down on you, there's a certain point where I tackle you.

cvmh66y,1,t3_3n7wk4,JoeCoder,"> The alternative then is to hypothesize the insulin protein wasn't life critical at first.

I don't know the specifics of insulin metabolism, but why couldn't it be?  Perhaps it existed alongside a different type of metabolism and gradually improved until the old way was no longer needed?  That idea is certainly ""pure speculation without any scientific support"".  But we have three categories:

1.  High probability it happened this way.
2.  Could've happened this way, but we don't know the probability.
3.  Too low of a probability it happened this way to consider

To make a positive case against evolutionary theory we need #3, not #2.
