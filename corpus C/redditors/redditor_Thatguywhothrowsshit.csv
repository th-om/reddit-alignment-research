cvx2x0c,0,t1_cvwzquf,Thatguywhothrowsshit,"> There are more important concerns within the economy than simply preventing the formation of ""bubbles."" Like, jobs.

No, preventing leveraged bubbles is far more important, because historically they are the primary cause for long term mass unemployment or strife.

Labor markets (and pretty much every market) always follows the real asset markets, and if real asset markets are **purposely** structured to become inflated on the long term, everyone and every market is going to have big problems going forward if something(this would be en masse mortgage defaults in 2007) causes that highly leveraged market to slow down in cash flows.

Lending money to **consumers** causes conditions for currency inflation, which leads to product inflation(to compensate for the added costs of trade), op isn't wrong there. But on the flip side high quantities structural debt can lead to debt market devaluation, because it increases chances of default or even worse money printing pay outs.

People want rate increases so their savings asset values can keep up with the increased prices of every day goods (literally inflation)",29,0,1444669218,1444721812

cvue0um,0,t1_cvude87,Thatguywhothrowsshit,"I think the hardest problem for most people where it should be a no go is the second point you mentioned. Assessing companies, a lot of people always get caught up in their own personal biases that prevents them from seeing very good opportunities.

And I'd say the second hardest part is structuring the investment, entrepreneurs get very stinky when they are offered legally binding covenants they don't want or when they have to give away a substantial proportion of their position to control the direction their idea moves.",3,0,1444440913,1444721812
cvu6t0q,0,t1_cvtju00,Thatguywhothrowsshit,"It's not unwarranted bias however, and I have my firm convictions that they are becoming more and more too exposed to the bloated residential and low-mid cap lending markets that can lead to drastic consequences for the industry itself.

Like it or not, low interest rates make the eniviorment they operate right now as saturated as it is, and it will have dire consequences on the primary and secondary markets. If a an undomestic uncontrollable economic variable triggers a drop in consumption, banks(and entire economies) will be the farthest things immune from that.

Possible economic triggers would be high exchange rate volitility (this directly impacts foreign lending), over expanded trade deficits (too much offshoring can lead to consumption collapses, which impacts local economies heavily), political conflict (this kills tourism, which exacerbates the globalization problem (money doesn't leave countries))",1,0,1444427349,1444721812
