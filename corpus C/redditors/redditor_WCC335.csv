cvx8ext,0,t1_cvx1kp4,WCC335,">I would bet that most people who are 'pro-choice' think that abortions should be reduced as much as possible, and that they aren't a fundamentally 'good' thing, in the sense that they should be strived for (like eating healthy, for example).

This confuses the issue for many pro-lifers, though. For the pro-lifer, the fetus is either it is a human life or it isn't. If it is not a human life, it does matter what we do to them. If a fetus isn't a human life, abortion isn't a ""lesser-of-two-evils,"" it is not an evil at all. ",3,0,1444677202,1444720401
cvx7mcl,0,t1_cvx6xj2,WCC335,"I would ask him when the last time a student punched him in the face was. The consequences for punching someone in the face are a lot less serious than murdering someone, and students already have their fists in the classroom. 

The reality is that people that carry firearms legally in Texas are statistically much less likely to commit crimes. ",8,0,1444676050,1444720401

Do you think a student that plans on murdering his professor cares whether it's a gun-free zone? Is there a student who thinks to himself, ""Finally! It's legal to take my gun to school! I can finally murder my professor without incurring the additional charge of having a firearm where one isn't permitted!"" ",13,0,1444672045,1444720401

cvx1p6z,0,t1_cvx1dx5,WCC335,"That's up to you. The general effect it will have on your goals is simple arithmetic. Generally, you have to eliminate 3,500 calories to lose one pound. Your body doesn't care whether these are cheat day calories or not. 

A cheat day is not consequence-free. A cheat day should be designed to help you more effectively reach your weight-loss goals. If you're choosing between having an occasional scheduled cheat day and failing completely on your diet, a cheat day is your best option. 

If you can cut without any cheat days, that will be the fastest way to your goal. If you have to have a cheat day, and you are in the habit of tracking your calories, continue to track your cheat day calories so you can account for the weight gain or slowed weight loss. 

Personally, my ""cheat days"" still have a planned caloric maximum. ",6,0,1444667343,1444720401

Here's what I pessimistically see happening: TCU drops a game (maybe OSU), and Baylor loses to TCU. It's kind of a reversed-roles version of last year.
