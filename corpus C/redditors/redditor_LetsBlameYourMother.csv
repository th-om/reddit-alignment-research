cvwk53r,1,t3_3obwf2,LetsBlameYourMother,"I was (slightly) disappointed by **Fates and Furies** by Lauren Groff. Like her first novel, this one contained some terrific sentence-level writing, some lively dialogue, and some deftly-drawn characters, but didn't really have much of a story to tell. The novel is a sort of biography of a romantic relationship, related first from the husband's perspective and then from the wife's (both sections are in close 3rd person); the jacket copy seemed to promise mind-blowing *Rashomon*-style revelations in the second half . . . but there really weren't any. Sure, the wife's backstory was nutso-bananas (and not in a good way: it felt like a plot rejected by a daytime soap opera's writing room as ""too ridiculous""). But that zany tale had almost no impact on the events we saw in the first half of the novel. Groff can really freaking *write*, so I hope she eventually finds compelling *stories* worthy of her obvious talents. Rating: In the classic game of ""Fuck/Marry/Kill"" this would be a ""fuck"" (3/5).

I also read Brandon Sanderson's **new Mistborn book**, which was probably unfair to Sanderson as his technical problems as a writer were thrown into sharp relief after reading someone as good as Lauren Groff. Good Lord (Ruler), I have never encountered quite so many groan-inducing ""dad jokes"" crammed into one novel. Sanderson does many things very well, but ""impersonating Oscar Wilde"" is simply not one of them. If there is a metal that enhances self-awareness, I implore Sanderson to burn it. The plot here -- typically Sanderson's forte -- didn't quite work for me either: the novel concerns an assassination plot, but the target of the assassin was such a smug, corrupt jerk that it didn't feel as though anything important was at stake. Finally, the real selling point for me of these books is the slow reveal of the rules behind this compelling puzzle-box of a universe . . . but there wasn't much in the way of revelations on that front either. Rating: 2/5 (might have been 4/5 if Wayne had been eaten by hemalurgic dingos at some point and his wretched dad-jokes forever silenced). ",3,0,1444620086,1444723593

cvwi3do,0,t1_cvwdeo5,LetsBlameYourMother,"Just as a warning: The first episode is actually pretty weak; it started-out seeming like a *Bones/Castle* knockoff. But it gets noticeably better w/ the 2nd, and once the overarching plot arcs kick in and the characters take on 3 dimensions a few episodes later, it starts to capture some of the same stuff that made *Veronica Mars* such a good show.",19,0,1444616403,1444723593
