cvp5j4e,0,t1_cvopybi,creativeocelot,"Okay, I'm going to walk you through this, after reading it again, I can see how you're getting confused.

*Step 1:* OP engages on your statement that subjective law is no good, and all law must be read literally.

*Step 2:* OP refutes your argument that ""cruel and unusual"" can be read literally, by utilizing the words ""cruel and unusual"" through a different understanding, most notably the understanding of ""unusual"" has been modified to mean ""unique to the defendant"" instead of ""uncommon or socially unacceptable"", which is what it's  commonly understood to mean. You concede that the clause is vague.

*Step 3:* Here's where OP kinda fails, and it's why I think he's just a student, and not an attorney. The connection should be made that because the clause is vague, along with dozens of other clauses in the document, it necessitates interpretation to be utilized. Even if you stick to the common definition of ""unusual"" you still have to qualify the clause, it can't be read literally in the same way that some of other parts of the Constitution can be.

Step 3: Because vague law is inherently subjective, it must be bad law from your view. So, the 8th is bad law. Here you come out of left field and start talking about law professors teaching the 8th as ""tautology"". While this would never happen, OP's reasoning is exactly what they look for; so long as your logic and reasoning are consistent and well argued, you will not be graded poorly in law school for making an argument that is morally questionable, or contrary to popular judicial interpretation.


Step 4: OP would have taken the final step, but you kinda derailed the conversation. The final step is that the establishment that many clauses necessitate interpretation effectively contests your original assertion. It leaves you with a tough argument to make to defend your original statement that subjective law is bad law, because that that means that much of the constitution is ""bad"". 

Also, because you conceded that the clause is vague, by default you admitted that some parts require interpretation. These parts can't be interpreted literally, leaving you with an even tougher argument to make to defend your original comment. Not impossible though.


I'm betting this is the scenario that OP was trying to present you with.

All /u/homelesspandas is doing is teasing out the reasoning behind your assertion that subjective law is bad law, and he turned your reasoning on itself. He did that using the 8th amendment. That's textbook law school thinking, I wouldn't be surprised if OP is a law student.

Tautology has nothing to do with what you guys are talking about, and OP never said anything about ignoring the 8th or about it being repetitive.",1,0,1444030875,1444718836

cuzuz6q,0,t1_cuzuvc1,creativeocelot,">the calories burned - calories eaten, 

Other way around. Your deficit is total calories eaten minus total calories burned. That number will be the calories from fat burned.

>at the end of the week to be 7000.

Be aware that this is pretty aggressive. If you are able to achieve this, there may be side effects. Eat more if you feel like shit.

>Then I'll set my daily caloric intake to be 100 less than my BMR, which means I'll burn 100 automatically

If you eat 1800cals a day, I'm *guessing* you will be around a 400 calorie deficit, putting you at around 2,800 calories from fat burned per week. You can add any work in the gym to this total, as it will all be burned from fat so long as your diet stays the same.

Final piece of advice, don't use the scale as a measure of progress. It can be *very* misleading. Use the mirror. Good luck.",1,0,1442133611,1444718836
cuzulyb,0,t1_cuzuikt,creativeocelot,"To be honest I'm not 100% sure on that. I'm pretty sure the main mechanism in ketosis is that your body is forced to burn fat as the primary energy source instead of carbs, and *not* the caloric deficit. That's a good question though, I've never really looked into it. I'm sure it would be prudent to do both during a keto-style diet though.",1,0,1442132020,1444718836
cuzujld,0,t1_cuztx00,creativeocelot,">So I'm starting to understand it. I just used a BMR calculator to get my BMR, and it says 1900. So if I eat 1600cal a day, that means i would ""burn"" 300cal a day?

Yes. You would ""burn"" 300 calories of fat, because that energy has to come from some place, so you will tap into your fat stores. But, like I said, the calories needed in your everyday life are probably more than 1900, so if you ate 1600cal, you would end up needing more than 300cal worth of fat to fuel that day.

>EDIT or would I ""burn"" my BMR no matter how much I eat a day?

Yes. Your diet does not effect your BRM. It will affect your fat levels if you eat above your TDEE(which is your BRM plus the calories required for whatever you do during the day).
