Sure there have been minor issues but they've been quickly fixed or taken care of via other means above and beyond what I've come to expect from consumer electronics companies. I switched over back in 2003 after too many frustrating years of companies over promising and under delivering with cheap materials, components, and shitty user experience. Meanwhile Microsoft is still launching half-baked clusterfucks every year, and having new and innovative features provides no benefit if the features don't work or don't play well with existing products.
