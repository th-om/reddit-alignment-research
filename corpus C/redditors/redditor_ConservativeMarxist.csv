cvdu4zb,1,t3_3mc6d9,ConservativeMarxist,"Check RealClearPolitics' aggregate polls instead of individual ones. Ex: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_democratic_presidential_primary-3351.html

It has a lagged effect - older polls are factored in with brand new ones - but it tends to filter out most of the noise from individual polls. Has Sanders +11.6 in NH right now, and Clinton +14.7 nationally.",5,0,1443195689,1444720009

What's more interesting is watching the fight over Majority Leader. There's going to be a strong push to elect a conservative to replace McCarthy.",7,0,1443195113,1444720009
cvdguej,1,t3_3ma8e6,ConservativeMarxist,"There's a market distortion.

No one is actually in the market to buy health care. They're in the market to buy health insurance, and their providers are in the market to sell to insurers. People don't ask the price of services, medicines, or surgeries they receive. They don't shop around multiple doctors to see who can provide something the cheapest. And they're generally shopping with their insurer's money, since they're only paying a fraction out of pocket compared to the actual cost of health care.",15,0,1443158189,1444720009
cvdgpoi,1,t3_3malnh,ConservativeMarxist,"China already has cap and trade programs in specific metropolitan areas (Guangdong, Shenzen, Shanghai, etc etc). The problem with these policies is that they are enforced unevenly. Some cities adhere to them better than others, and sometimes well-connected companies don't have to adhere to them at all.",3,0,1443157836,1444720009
cvdgm6h,1,t3_3mad5z,ConservativeMarxist,"I'll probably get downvoted for going against the grain, but here's how I think about this issue.

Look at it this way. The current status quo, if you believe that life begins at conception like I do, is that thousands of human lives each year are being involuntarily ended by medical professionals, and all of this is completely legal.

The plight of orphans and single mothers is a serious issue, and government needs to play a role to provide for people who are in need. But is it ethical for anyone to say that these human beings are better off being killed than living out their lives, however stacked against them the deck may be? I don't think so.",44,0,1443157565,1444720009

Until my household can borrow money at well under a 1% interest rate and raise taxes to increase its household income, I'm not going to pretend that it's anything remotely like the US government.",2,0,1344137613,1444720009
