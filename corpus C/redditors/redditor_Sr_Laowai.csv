cvsk8ld,0,t1_cvsjth7,Sr_Laowai,"There are so many viable VPNs in China that anyone who *wants* to get on Facebook can usually do so. But since none of their friends use it, what's the point? Everyone has Weibo or Weixin or QQ, so there's pretty much no demand for Facebook, aside from those who are more familiar with and interested in western culture.",38,0,1444318289,1444726968

cvajp2i,0,t1_cvahgh8,Sr_Laowai,"I think this has been effective for some people. If the tip on your meal would be something like $6 but you leave $15 instead and write a note saying something along the lines of, ""This is how much Bernie wants you to make as a minimum wage,"" how is that a negative thing?",3,0,1442951418,1444726968
