But, Poll workers are trained, they truly are.  There's a lot more that goes on behind the scenes that people standing in line to vote, won't see.

As a past Poll Worker, THANK YOU! Doing what you did is EXACTLY how it's supposed to work.


If they sat them down and talked to them for awhile, then it was taken care of. They got to the bottom of it, or the person wouldn't be able to cast a vote, even once, at any local polling place.

(They really do call the other polling places to warn them if the poll workers see anything hinky, going on.)

Poll workers are half Republicans and half Democrats. They police each other and the voters.

You spoke up when you saw something hinky at the Polls happened, you ROCK!",2,0,1444673376,1444730788

If it happened like you said, then you should have said something.

Voter fraud is a solution in search of a problem.

*btw, polling places are in touch with other polling places during voting. That person would have to not only have a valid ID, but also one with a picture. This is part of the poll workers' job, to make sure the face and the ID and the address all matches. Was that guy's picture on every one of those IDs? In your case, you should have said something. A poll worker would have gotten the guard and taken care of said fraudster. Extra voting laws aren't needed.*
