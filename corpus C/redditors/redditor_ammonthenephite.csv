cvxpfpg,0,t1_cvxdejp,ammonthenephite,"Be careful even using the temple as a metric.  I went through one time at the same time as a new missionary and a whole bunch of friends and family.  You would have thought you were at a picnic they were so loud in the celestial room.  Jabbering on in full, loud voices, talking over each other, it was anything *but* reverent, and I did not feel the spirit *at all*.  I actually felt rather annoyed at their complete disregard for everyone around them.

The time to see how it feels is when you are alone with God, perhaps even while fasting, and communing with Him, in a place where you can uninhibitedly speak with him out loud.  If you live alone then perfect, if not go for a hike in the woods or some other place where you can search and commune comfortably.  This would be my recommendation.",3,0,1444703171,1444720297
cvw3rlf,0,t1_cvw3o4b,ammonthenephite,"Good call on the scratching, I hadn't thought of that.  I am always sure to use 2 hands though when swapping out the secondary for the hyperstar.  I could definitely see dropping that thing straight on to it not ending well!

I grabbed a set of 'bob's' knobs as well so I could avoid the screwdriver thing.  Others use little allen screws which I think are actually better than the knobs, because you can get them tighter while also having the allen head help keep the allen key in the screw so you have less chance of slipping while adjusting.",1,0,1444592084,1444720297
cvw3a7f,0,t1_cvvy7ey,ammonthenephite,"The corrector plats are actually quite strong, and the hyperstar quite light.  You'd have to be pretty reckless to do any damage to your corrector plate, especially on the larger sct's like c11's and 14's.  The plate even on my c8 is decently thick and strong.

Getting a hyperstar on the used market can save you up to half the price, making them not an unreasonable purchase.  

The C8 version is the only one where you are really limited on what camera you use, due to the limited back focus.  But c9.25's and up you can pretty much use whatever camera you like.

Not something that will make everyone happy, but for those of us that like to have one scope that does it all rather than multiple scopes, its a nice option to have available.",1,0,1444591353,1444720297
cvw348x,0,t1_cvvsxwa,ammonthenephite,"Ya, traditional narrowband filters don't work as effectively, though I don't do narrowband at all so I'm not well versed on it.  I know the cable spikes can for the most part be mitigated by running them in a half loop instead of straight across the lens, but I just use a stand alone camera (nex-5n) so there are no cables at all to mess with.

Focus is another issue, but a few long exposures on faint stars using a bahtinov mask seems to work just fine for me.

Cost is probably the biggest mark against it, as for the price you can get some nice equipment that, while not as fast, still works well.  But I prefer having just the one scope that can do it all, and the hyperstar lets ya do that.  On the used market they can sometimes be found for half of their new price, which makes them much more reasonable.",1,0,1444591108,1444720297

cvsvqjg,0,t1_cvsqzih,ammonthenephite,"Depends on a lot of things.  Is there active shooting or is it simply a possible hostage situation without shooting yet?  If just a possible hostage situation with no shooting yet, definitely not, as that could trigger the shooter to begin killing.  If its an active shooting scenario then proceed to the next question.  Am I familiar with the other building or not?  Is it wide open spaces where they would see me long before I could get close (convention center, mall, etc) or are the spaces tight enough that I could get close before being spotted (hallways, offices, etc)?    My conceal carry weapon is only accurate to about 20 yards, given its shorter sight radius, a trade off for easier concealability.  What is the gunman using?  If they are using long guns, something you can sometimes (but not always) discern by the sound (deeper, longer boom for long gun, or higher pitched sharper and shorter report for pistols), and I can't get close to them, they'll have a much longer effective range than I will, and I'd only draw fire my direction, endangering those around me.  Any shooting from me that far away would only endanger others as I would need to be inside of 20 yards to be effective.

So, if the shooter is actively shooting, if I'm familiar with the building, and the layout would allow me to get close in without being spotted by them (mitigating the advantage of effective range a long gun would have over my conceal carry), the police aren't there yet, and I am able to identify the shooter, then I would call 911, let them know where I am, what I'm wearing, and what I'm doing, and I would attempt to stop the gunman and save any lives they would have killed had they had more time to keep shooting.  *I would not draw my weapon until ready to engage*, so as not to appear as another shooter.  I would not engage someone unless I knew they were the shooter (asking those coming out, watching what they are doing, etc).  

If I don't know the building, or if I can't safely get close to the shooter, or if I can't guarantee I won't be endangering others (lots of people around the shooter, unless I can get right on them), or if the police are all ready intervening, or if I can't be sure who the shooter is (no one to ask, no way to verify by actions, etc), then no, I would not engage anyone, or even attempt to enter depending on the exact circumstances of the specific situation.

Now, if I were in the same building, or in the same room, I'll engage for certain, though with much of the same cautions mentioned above, as my life is *immediately* threatened along with everyone around me.

Assuming you are asking this to know if I would have been of any help were I on the Oregon campus, I only would have made a difference if I were in the same building and somewhat close to the shooter.  If I were buildings away with the police all ready responding and on scene, I would have made the same call as the one conceal carrier interviewed, and not intervened.  If I'd been withing a few classrooms or in the same classroom, I for sure would have made a difference.",2,0,1444335045,1444720297
