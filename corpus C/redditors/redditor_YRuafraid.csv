cvr9p90,1,t3_3nu73u,YRuafraid,"I'm like that too, an introvert at heart, quite and reserved, usually a man of few words unless I have to speak. I have no problem talking around friends who I'm very comfortable with, but I sometimes get a little nervous when I'm about to go on a date and worry about running out of things to say or being too quite. 

I've learned to be comfortable about it though. If you constantly worry about what to say next you will have a harder time with the conversation. Be a good listener, and there will always be something the other person says that you can branch off to or comment on to continue a conversation. If you just worry about what to say and forget to listen then you will surely run out of things to say. Use your environment as a cue to ask the person something or to make a comment. Don't be afraid to share a story or give an opinion/perspective on something that you are currently talking about or something relevant to where you guys are. Don't worry or overthink on what to say, it's okay to be a little quite sometimes, but when people start talking, even from a simple ""how was your day"" you'll be surprised at how many opportunities you have to comment on something or branch the conversation in a new direction, as long as you genuinely listen and are not afraid to share your own thoughts / experiences in whatever you're talking about.

Also like others have mentioned, let them do a lot of the talking, but make some comments or share your opinions as well (there will be a lot of opportunities to do that when you get them to talk) so it doesn't seem like an interview ",4,0,1444227135,1444720873
