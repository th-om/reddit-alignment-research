cvrspdf,0,t1_cvrsazo,Lenolamick,"I like the movie quite a bit, but i don't disagree with a lot of what you say here.  I don't mind dreaming up Medellin's past and accepting that he rides off into the sunset to Colombia, but i wasn't satisfied with the agent's conclusion and felt like there should have been something more.  That said, i thought much of the movie was striking and makes Mexico look terrifying.",4,0,1444255397,1444731256

cv2xba0,0,t1_cv2p198,Lenolamick,"He was throwing off of his heels, that rarely works out well.  I will say thought that i think his game was so much better than the line indicates.   There was a clear disconnect in timing between Bradford and his receivers for much of the first half.  Either he was throwing everything a yard too early in their patterns or they were turning too slow (or in some cases not at all) for the ball.  Not to mention the drops and penalties that spoiled a few good plays.",1,0,1442359771,1444731256
