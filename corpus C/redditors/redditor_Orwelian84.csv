In the American context the state is the courts, patent trade office, registries, notaries, etc. In your caveman scenario the caveman is the state. The work is all mostly paperwork and logging, societies have grown in both scale and complexity over the last 10k years. The force is mostly legalistic in the American context, lawers and judges do all that work arguing over whose rights are superior or valid. 

>Are they? I would contend that capital's qualities come from its nature and its holder's thrift.

Um...I am not sure how to even go about responding to that. Thriftyness surely helps with using capital efficiently, but that has nothing to do with the global trade networks that have been setup and maintained by states. Not to mention all of the underlying infrastructure required to support those networks. Those networks disproportionately benefit capital in a way that reduces labors power to effectively bargain in a global marketplace. As of yet there are no significant transnational labor unions that collectively bargain. 

>OK, but is there any time when you would say that the differentials are worse for the system, but better for the individuals, and still worth it?

I would only agree to to this statement at points of inflection where the system has come to a crisis that it cannot recover from. This gets a little meta, but, if the underpinnings of the system led to the present point of irrecoverable crisis than something is fundamentally wrong with it. Better to let it fail and build anew learning from the mistakes of the past than try and patch the system. It's my personal mental check against human tendency toward sunk costs fallacy.

cvvg0u6,0,t1_cvvfnzz,Orwelian84,">Well, I disagree, probably because of my metaphysical beliefs. I think that concepts like rights can exist independent of objective reality. The work determines the right.

If the work determines the right and the work is done by the State does not the State have the right to set the parameters of the right?

>Yes, and that should be a benefit to capital. Power differences can exist without having to be corrected. If I'm running a footrace, my opponent shouldn't get a head start because I'm faster.

I agree that capital should have some benefit, least not because it can be representative of past works. However, structural benefits, e.g capital's increased mobility and fungibility should be countered imo as they are not a consequence of the holder's works but are a function of the collective institutions that societies have empowered and enabled. 

>So power has to be balanced in all cases? There's never a case where regulations have to give more power to the powerful and less power to the already powerless? Or where no regulation should be in force and the power dynamic that exists is proper.

I wouldn't say in all cases, nor would I say deferentials are always bad or in need of correction. Gotta have some differentials to make a meritocratic system function. ",1,0,1444532387,1444725010

>The first time a caveman took a stick and sharpened it against a rock to make a spear, he created property rights. 

If they were inherent the caveman would never have had to sharpen the stick. I'm not really a believer in natural rights. There are only the rights that we grant ourselves through our institutions. A human has no more claim to the land than the fox to it's den. Since the State, through use of legal and physical force, enforces your contract of ownership over a given parcel, they have the right to set those terms. 

>It's something I have trouble understanding why people on the left don't get. When an employee gets a job, they agree on a rate of pay. That's the entirety of the transaction.

I can't speak for the left, but for me, it is because it's an inherently schewed transaction in favor of capital. Capital has more power in that situation than labor because capital can more easily move from one geography to another or one market to another. 

If you are paid for your labor and depend on that payment for meeting basic necessities you are more apt to take a pay cut, or other benefit reduction, than tale a hard line in negotiation because of the risk of no money at all. If we had a perfect market I wouldn't have problems with less regulation. 

The current power differential where capital can act globally while labor cannot, is why I support regulations curtailing the power of capital. I would support similar regulations on unions if they were as powerful as they were back in the 60s/70s, can't have labor having more power than capital end up disincentivizing investment. 

So bringing it back to the OT the act of having to contract out into the public, e.g outside of the family, is what imo should be the line between closely held and public. That leaves aside all transportation and procurement personnel, no business could be considered closely held if the standard required that even the transport and procurement people be related. I am talking about sales people, accountants, etc. ",1,0,1444530741,1444725010
cvv2bgy,0,t1_cvv1kx5,Orwelian84,">...Kinda? I do think that taxation is a violation of property rights. But I think I'm more of a minarchist. I'm fine with a government that punishes forcible bodily injury or property damage.

See I don't think one can ""own"" property absent a state(or again some structure analogous to it) of some kind enforcing that ownership. Since states grant and guarantee those rights, which are in essence monopolies on usage rights, I think it is fair that there be some regulations. Just like a utility isn't allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, I don't think owning property, again aside from your place of residence, gives one immediate license to discriminate as they see fit. 

>I could go with that, but if one person owns the corporation entirely, then, in my opinion, even if it has locations across states or countries, it should be that person's rules. If you don't sell stock, it's closely held.

The only reason I disagree with this is that logistically speaking while it might all be owned by one person or family, it simply could not exist without other people doing the leg work. That necessity of public labor to actually function is what, in my mind, separates a closely held family run business from a multistate public(not in the stock trading sense) company. 

It is simply unfair that one company could compete against others under a different set of rules at that scale. In a city or town a mom and pop that can discriminate and gain advantage(not having to pay for certain medical procedures for example) is unlikely to be able force other businesses out by virtue of the constraints on their access to labor, it must be truly family owned and operated to be considered closely held imo. 

Large companies like hobby lobby are leveraging economies of scale that rely on tens of thousands of workers. They shouldn't get to play by different rules because of the capital owners religious beliefs.

EDIT

In all honestly I really am not bothered by small local businesses discriminating, I think social shaming can deal with that just fine. I am mostly concerned with large national and supranational companies using these laws to further abuse labor. If companies are already willing to set up shell companies in other countries just to save on paying taxes, what would they do if they could assert religious rights. ",1,0,1444506654,1444725010

Are you an Ancap? I ask because if you are we won't really ever agree. I don't see taxation as a form of theft. 

>But the public square ends at the boundary of private property.

Yes....and that's why when you are in the public square your rights to discriminate are curtailed. Not sure what your point is here. 

>I see what you're talking about with closely-held, and I think that our economic regulations should be lessened to encourage that kind of building instead of the major multinational. But even so, in my opinion, so long as the shareholders of a business, through normal governance channels, run the company any way they want, including discriminating.

I don't believe that any company that has shareholders can be considered closely held, unless all shareholders are related(which would be odd). Public market = Public rules = FRAND",1,0,1444500574,1444725010
cvuyh9b,0,t1_cvuy0te,Orwelian84,"> No, I think every school should get to decide. And none of them should be tax funded.

So as a starting point we are on opposite sides of a canyon, I believe fundamentally in the right to education and it's funding via the public. Public education was one of the biggest advancements, culturally speaking, of the last century. You can't have an informed population without mass literacy and no one has yet come up with a model that provides that better or more fairly than public education(I am sure such a model exists, no one has found it yet)

>But we don't live our entire lives in our homes. Why can't I run a religious business as well?

This is true, but the public square is where all beliefs must be tolerated, logically this means the public square in a pluralistic society must have a default of secular, otherwise it preferences one religious view over another. 

> So you can have a religious business, you just can't be very good at it?


It's not that you can't be good, it's the closely held part of the ruling. I don't believe it is possible to closely hold a multistate business. Maybe Mormons or traditional Catholics with their large families could, but the vast majority of families don't have enough people to staff a business of Hobby Lobby's size.

>That's the heart of it. I think it is important. I care far more about being free to be tolerant or intolerant, than I care about being tolerated for my demographics.

I look at the Dutch and their problems, they are arguably more tolerant of intolerance than we are and look at the social ills they have had to contend with. Believe what you want in your churches, mosques, temples, and homes, but no you don't get to legislate that, nor do you get to through threats of violence coerce the rest of us into living life the way you think your god prefers. 

You may not see those threats presented in the national media, but having lived in the rural south, those threats are a very real problem for a great many people. ",2,0,1444499566,1444725010

You believe that businesses should be allowed to discriminate on the basis of their sincerely held religious beliefs. 

You believe that schools should be forced to teach Creationism alongside evolution and cosmology. 

You believe that unsubstantiated and unconfirmed claims from 2000 year old tribesmen should be given equal weight to modern, falsifiable, and confirmed claims. 

Sure I believe people have the right to self determination and a right to personal belief. But those rights all exist within your home, the moment you enter the public space, 1st amendment separation of church and state kick in. Not everyone, not even a majority, support biblical sharia as the default in the public square. 

You don't like evolution, fine, home school and try and get into an accredited college with your Falwell-backed diploma.  

I don't think businesses should be forced to sell merchandise or offer services that they feel violates their religious beliefs. But I think public companies shouldn't be allowed to curtail access or enforce dogmas on employees. 

I actually agree with the SCOTUSs call on closely held businesses being afforded a religious exemption. Mom and pops are really just an extension of their home(so independent bakers feel free to deny cakes as you see fit - Safeway too bad so sad you must sell cakes to everyone). I strongly disagree that Hobby Lobby, a multistate corporation, counts as closely held, but that's a semantic debate. 

Ditto for churches, they are exempted by the same 1st amendment that protects the rest of us from them. 

It's 2015, and while tolerance of diverse views is an important aspect of a pluralistic society, tolerance of intolerance is not. Look at the Dutch and their struggles with radical Islam(which is clearly distinct from moderate Islam which is compatible with modern society just like moderate Christianity is).
