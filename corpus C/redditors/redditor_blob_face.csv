cv23k53,0,t1_cv205f5,blob_face,"I'm not making the case for either reason, but your evidence for it being only gender norms is weak. For example, let's say that there is some evolutionary reason that a higher percentage of men are interested in politics than women. In the past, in a more patriarchal society, this could have meant all women were stereotyped as being unfit for politics and barred from entering the political world. Now that those restrictions on women are less common than before, perhaps a larger number of the percentage of women who are political actually show their interest. However, that percentage of women who are political is still smaller than the percentage of men. I just made this up and it may have no basis in reality, but the point is that your evidence is inconclusive.",3,0,1442298739,1444729136
