cvq1oud,1,t3_3noh2l,ItsTimToBegin,"Riverside - cheapest of the off-campus student apartment complexes. Very close to both Blossom St. Bridge and Gervais St. Bridge, so you can definitely walk/ride your bike. They also have a shuttle that runs to/from campus every 15 minutes. 

Cayce Cove - also very cheap. Also have a reliable shuttle system. Not close enough to walk but if you wanted to ride your bike, it wouldn't be too much of a problem. 

Garnet River Walk - if you've got more money, it's in basically the same location as Riverside but for about $100/month more. Definitely nicer. Also has a good shuttle system. 

The Lofts - located at the base of Main St at the intersection with Whaley St., this is ideal if you have engineering/science classes. Decently priced but kindof run down. You could catch a campus shuttle in front of Swearingen and get to any part of campus pretty easily. 

The Hub - don't live here. Just don't. It's a waste of money, parking sucks, and it is literally falling apart. ",1,0,1444138181,1444724676
