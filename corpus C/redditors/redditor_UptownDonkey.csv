cvuhdio,1,t3_3o55ju,UptownDonkey,Never seen a Cisco branded USB serial adapter. If they exist they must be very rare. I wonder if Cisco did make a USB serial adapter would you have to buy a support contract to download drivers? Hmm. Anyway generic USB serial adapters work fine if you stay away from the very low cost/quality $2.99 eBay specials. You might also consider buying a PCI-E serial card for the servers or maybe a used serial console. Older Digi/Raritan serial consoles are dirt cheap these days.,1,0,1444448262,1444728806

cvtfiqe,0,t1_cvszp4v,UptownDonkey,"It's not a good excuse but it's an extremely plausible explanation. This is exactly how many large companies are structured to operate. They choose to silo different departments / organizational units to function very independently of each other. The different groups function as 'black boxes' to each other. Each group is setup to simply complete assigned tasks. All communication is channeled between mid-level managers who are only slighter bigger black boxes. 

With all these black boxes working independently of each other and layers of abstraction there may not be any one individual to blame. It's more like an institutional failure of management / culture. No individual has to say 'break the rules' because everyone understands (or assumes) meeting their set goals is the only rule that matters. It's facilitated by senior management who only care about 'meeting their goals' for 24-36 months until a better job offer comes along. ",2,0,1444369806,1444728806
cvtc62i,0,t1_cvt6y64,UptownDonkey,That's true however there's a very competitive second hand market for iPhones that compete with devices like the Moto X. You can get a used iPhone 5S for $250-$300 or 5/C for $150-$200. For someone with only very basic needs a 4S for $100-$125 isn't a bad option. ,2,0,1444361831,1444728806
cvtaxlj,0,t1_cvt0l6t,UptownDonkey,"> Google needs to put their foot down..

It's probably too late for that. Google made a deal with the devil (aka carriers/OEMs) to trade control of the platform in exchange for rapid growth in marketshare. The economics of Android are built around carriers/OEMs having the power to do what is in their best interests. For OEMs that's slashing the expense of providing long term support / testing. For carriers it's things like bundling shovelware and taking advantage of the commodity market where they can benefit from OEM competition. 

It's going to be difficult to change the terms of that deal at this late stage without risking the whole house of cards collapsing. There is a risk forced updates could send carriers/OEMs flocking to a non-Google Android alternative. Then there's Samsung who is clearly in a position to be the last man standing in a Google/OEM vs. OEM civil war. To complicate things even more Microsoft might still be willing to throw an awful lot of money at OEMs to adopt Windows. Even without all those concerns Google can't really play hardball without a risk of violating anti-trust laws. 

Google just has to hope they can fix the worst of the security issues this causes before the inevitable ILuvYou / Mellisa meltdown happens. It would help to start warning users of unpatched/insecure devices about the risks. Perhaps a trade-in / Nexus discount would be a good strategy too. At least then they could shift the blame onto the users when shit blows up. ",17,0,1444359681,1444728806
cvs3nl3,1,t3_3nwae6,UptownDonkey,"Times have changed. Apple doesn't need to supplement Mac/iOS application development anymore with lots of first party apps. I don't think iWork will be abandoned though. It will probably get absorbed into iOS instead. For example a lot of Pages/Keynote features would be a good fit for Notes. Some features of Numbers might land in Calculator. In that process iWork private frameworks would shift over to the SDK for things like NSSpreadSheet, NSPresentation, NSVeryRichTextEdit, etc. ",2,0,1444273649,1444728806

cvqxq61,0,t1_cvq5qem,UptownDonkey,"> that sounds like really useful information to have

Not really no. Unless you're a highly trained/skilled mechanic most of the data available via OBD2 is utterly useless. The data by itself is just noise unless you have the knowledge to analyze it. Usually that requires a very strong understanding of how the engine is designed, sensor placement, quirks in how the ECU reports the data, details of ECU firmware revisions, etc. 

Since it is utterly useless information to non-engineers, non-mechanics, non-*automakers*, it's also not much of a privacy violation to end-users. I can't imagine anyone would be using Android Auto / Google Services and somehow be upset over OBD2 data collection. The only reason this is notable is because of how obviously self serving it is for Google to collect this data for their own use. There isn't even a tiny little thin pretense of legitimacy here. It is of no benefit to anyone except Google. ",0,0,1444190198,1444728806
cvptoaq,0,t1_cvpn49v,UptownDonkey,"> Which part of this is evil again?

It's not evil just dumb. They're (effectively) prioritizing the collection of OBD2 data over at the expense of making the platform less appealing to auto makers. It's not a good trade-off given that OBD2 data is utterly useless to most non-mechanics. For the tiny minority of people who do want OBD2 data it's very easy to obtain via other methods. 

For auto makers it's simply a practical consideration of not wanting to make design changes to accommodate this. Most cars are not designed to provide OBD2 data to stereos. They are however designed to provide basic parking break / reverse indicators to stereos. So you have something that's not of much use to users and an added expense/complication for auto makers. It only benefits Google's desire to collect this data for whatever reason. ",25,0,1444110188,1444728806
