cvwtnbm,0,t1_cvwgyqm,anti09,">You've got a pretty aggrandized view of yourself if you actually believe people think there's a conspiracy theory about you. Like what you're doing actually matters enough to the world that anyone would pay for it. 

A significant portion of /r/bitcoin actually believes this. There have been numerous posts about it. At one point, someone even compiled a list of likely paid shills (can't find the link atm). ",4,0,1444650847,1444730068

cvwf9u6,0,t1_cvwcc9e,anti09,">Bitcoin is valuable because it's a token of value exchange that will definitely become less available as time goes on. 

Replace ""Bitcoin"" with ""Litecoin"" or ""Monero"" or any other alt and your logic breaks down.

Currency isn't valuable because it's scarce. It's valuable because people can trade it for goods and service. Right now, it's difficult - and in many cases, impossible - to do that with bitcoin. So until that changes, the ""value"" bitcoin provides will remain stagnant. ",3,0,1444611404,1444730068
cvwf4c4,0,t1_cvw9ogk,anti09,">Because every. Single. Time. Something even remotely related to macroeconomics or global finances is posted on the Internet you get dweebs left and right saying stupid shit like ""Herp derp, Bitcoin user unaffected"" or the collapse of a certain country such as Greece means that Bitcoin will save them like it's the second coming of Jesus or something. It gets very, very annoying.

It also doesn't help that many bitcoiners rabidly embrace fringe economic doctrines and run around frothy-mouthed calling anyone who doesn't agree with them a ""statist."" It's funny at first, but it gets old after awhile.",9,0,1444611114,1444730068
