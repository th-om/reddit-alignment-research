That tells me that you relive this relationship over and over again. Without thinking twice. It's a constant thought. I mean in your tl;dr you mention her as ""the love of your life."" You have to let it go. Find a hobby or go meet other girls. After two years she is probably a different person and you are having feelings for the memories you had with her and the person you knew her as. ",1,0,1444711745,1444727284

cvqsfdg,0,t1_cvqq7ab,GB88,"I told her that since he worked in electrical work and my brother has always roomed next to big electrical things (break box) that they were probably sensitive to it since its proven that some people are sensitive to electromagnetic waves that can cause hallucinations. He moves into a new apartment next to all the electrical meters in the complex and is in full steam with taking hits to the head in his MMA classes along with the stress of his alcoholic bi polar girlfriend, there were more than enough reasons to suggest he was having a mental break down but no these demons were after him.... So I just came back from throwing a coconut into an empty intersection. 


During the conversation before the coconut throw I told her I was an atheist and she felt like she failed as a mother. Told me everything she's done and I ended up like this, that I don't have a soul that I don't believe in anything...but that she was okay with it. Talk about a fucked up mixed message. This is why I haven't told her that I'm gay. She told me that throwing the coconut was her way of helping me find a job. Told me ""know one has to know"" what I do. Until my brother came home and I caught them whispering. It was obvious she was spilling the beans on my beliefs. It's a fucking double standard so you know what, I'm going to be open about the chicken sacrifices and coconut throwing. She tried to tell me...or at least convince her self that what we were doing was nt voodoo. Yet after the coconut throwing contest we have to light a candle for 3 days. 


I made it clear I was doing this for her, not me. I was clear in saying that I do not believe in this or a higher power. ",1,0,1444180503,1444727284
cvqp83i,0,t1_cvqp5zk,GB88,That's what I told her. I told her I'll do it for her. She got a bit offended and said I had to do it for her. I repeated myself that I'll do it for her. I ignore these things because it makes them feel better. ,3,0,1444174979,1444727284
