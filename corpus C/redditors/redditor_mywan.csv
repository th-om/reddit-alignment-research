cvxjaoc,0,t1_cvxfohk,mywan,">There could only be a single task available to humans and we would still trend towards full employment perpetually.

Consider the [paradox of thrift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_thrift). Assume people are limited to painting and fully employed doing so. Food production and distribution, building, etc., are all fully automated. Just click purchase on your smartphone and the bots bring it. Some peoples paintings will be a highly limited an expensive commodity. Other people will be indistinguishable from billions of other competitors, who then must compete on price alone. Incomes will still have a power law structure (not a problem in itself for me). As people compete through thrift the bottom price tier will be set to a minimum survival standard. 

This creates a situation where even if we had an existing productive capacity to globally increase 1000% it wouldn't happen even if some people could barely eat as competition by thrift drove down demand.

This has been happening by way of labor cost for many years now. [Take a look at the historical variations in the capital to labor return ratio](http://www-tc.pbs.org/prod-media/newshour/photos/2012/12/06/Andrew_Smithers_chart_blog_main_horizontal.JPG). In that graph the balance point is at a 71 to 29 ratio. At present labor returns is about at 22%.

>“I mean the stability of the proportion of national dividend accruing to labour, irrespective apparently of the level of output as a whole and of the phase of the trade cycle. This is one of the most surprising, yet best-established, facts in the whole range of economic statistics.........Indeed... the result remains a bit of a miracle.” [Keynes 1939]

This is the equivalent consequence of the paradox of thrift. Only instead of employees saving this money it is eschewed in competition for jobs, i.e., competition by thrift. You could also call it the paradox of capital thrift, as capital seeks thrift through a reduction of labor cost without an equivalent reduction in retail cost.

Absolutely no new economic mechanism is invoked, and the underlying mechanism is universally accepted, i.e., paradox of thrift. It's just not well accepted how to define how much is too much. For an economy to be maximized supply and demand must match. Given a mismatch then the size of the economy is constrained by the most constrained side of the equation. When capital is excessively constrained it creates hyperinflation while driving demand. When labor returns are excessively constrained is suppresses inflation while suppressing demand. When demand is so constrained to well below capacity then, in spite of the excess capital, it's not profitable to invest in more productivity because the market demand can't afford to purchase more than what it already purchases. Hence production must be cut to better match demand. 

This is why productivity has outgrown economic growth over the past three decades. This is why we are looking at such low and even negative interest rates. This is why production is constrained even as so many people need this supply but can't afford to create that demand even with full time jobs. This is why the Feds engaging in Quantitative Easing has failed to induce their target level of inflation.

>There really isn't disagreement on this, the mechanism you are proposing for labor to be replaced simply does not exist.

In what manner are you referring to? When you say it ""does not exist"" are you saying it ""can not exist"" under any circumstances? Because there most certainly is disagreement on that issue. Not that it represent anything to be concerned about anytime soon, which I'm sure all but a few outliers would agree on.

However, even in the absents of such a mechanism existing, if your also saying that there is no economic mechanism which forces people, rich and poor, to globally live well below our productive capacity you are simply wrong. In fact, this particular argument is at the foundation of epic disagreements among Nobel laureate economist. The fact that your textbook claims that as the price of labor goes down the demand for that labor goes up falls flat when without the consumer demand created by that labor cost there is no market to sell the products of that cheaper labor. The richer our potential productivity becomes the more extreme this effect becomes with respect to actual productivity. This remains true even if your absolute right that no technological mechanism exist, or ever will ever exist, to replace labor.",1,0,1444693610,1444717672
cvxfk4z,0,t1_cvx2m3a,mywan,">Humans have comparative advantage for some skills because we are humans (IE utility is derived from far more then simply price), machines being able to do the same tasks humans can doesn't mean that people will desire machine produced goods over human produced goods.

This was [my explanation last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/comments/3i2zx0/a_weird_thing_about_the_unemployment_debate/cud8uhi) why human jobs will remain even in the event that no human is required to meet anybodies needs. So yes, I understand how utility not only goes beyond cost but also beyond mechanistic function. 

Just because we will have a aesthetic predisposition to preferring human produced goods does not mean that it will be anything more than a secondary market. In fact in order to drive the productivity gains necessary for large numbers of people to have enough wealth to eschew machine produced products requires a lot of wealth to be derived from automation. People will pick and choose specific purchases on a humanistic basis while the majority of their underlying needs are met through automation.

>Alternatively consider if the entire economics field is likely to be wrong and you are likely to be right. 

Just exactly what does the entire economics field claim that you think I disagree with?

I'm guessing that is based on the notion it's even possible for the Luddite Fallacy to become moot. Aside from the fact that the entire field of economics doesn't universally agree, I chose the word ""moot"" on purpose. Mootness of the Luddite Fallacy does not imply the lack of the ability of people to compete in the market in some respect. It merely implies the lack of necessity to do so by any subset of the population, while still maintaining technological and economic growth.

If there is a manner in which I disagree with the entire field of economics it was not contained here. I have provided that argument repeatedly in /r/Economics. Yet I am a Keynesian, and even that which I differ on can just as easily be defined as agreeing with two opposing economic camps in which a limiting factor to the validity of each sides argument exists. In particular it revolves around the classic argument between a supply side driven vs a demand side driven economy. I'll be happy to explain, but the post above contains none of that.
