cvtpktz,1,t3_3o3pxh,DefinitelyNotTedCruz,"Even though I generally consider /u/Smitty9913 deplorable, and even though I was overjoyed with his permaban, I must admit that he has done, at least from what I've seen, a good job moderating this subreddit.

I think making another press subreddit just to spite him is a bit unecessary.",10,0,1444401052,1444725744
cvtcs50,0,t1_cvt9jrv,DefinitelyNotTedCruz,"Not saying Scalise isn't in the running, but I definitely doubt he is a formidable candidate for the Speakership, given that his dubious ties with the Klan are bound to resurface, but more specifically, because he can't pull the establishment votes he needs.

And I don't think regional whips factor into the de facto line of succession.  Once you get that low, it's really anyone's ball game.

cvsnlt4,1,t3_3nzoy7,DefinitelyNotTedCruz,"My guess is the establishment wing of the party doesn't let Webster walk into the job.  I can't necessarily speak for Chaffetz, but I think Peter Roskam and/or Paul Ryan are going to emerge as potential candidates.

Edit: McMorris-Rodgers has quietly became a prominent behind-the-scenes Republican, culminated by her response to the SOTU this year.  Not sure why she didn't pop up as a candidate in my mind right away.",15,0,1444323279,1444725744
