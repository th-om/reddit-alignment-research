cvx8jib,1,t3_3ogdae,pizzahedron,"i wonder why so many media outlets are portraying california's water problem as an issue with individuals and households consuming too much water. it's almost as though some people with a lot of money are paying them to select what sort of 'news' they print.

agriculture uses between 60 and 70% of the available water supply, and the largest growers and the largest consumers suffer the least restrictions on their water usage. the giant agriculture growers who purchased their water rights before 1914 have *no* restrictions on their water usage, no increased charges for increased usage.

~~that 1,300 gal a day is just drops in the agriculture bucketfuls.~~

edit: going after a single private household is rude and creepy, even if they are using obscene amounts of water.

i fucking hate people who make me feel guilty for flushing the toilet.",20,0,1444677382,1444727918

that was the point i was trying to get.",0,0,1444676428,1444727918
cvx7q0a,0,t1_cvwzizv,pizzahedron,"i agree, both the walrus and the carpenter seem to be monstrous partners that eat the guileless oysters. the carpenter is the silent partner, not setting the trap, but not protesting. the walrus jabbers on, his words saying anything and not often agreeing with his actions. 

i don't think lennon wanted to be the silent partner.

most likely he just remembered the most famous quote:

>""The time has come,"" the Walrus said,
>""To talk of many things:
>Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
>Of cabbages--and kings--
>And why the sea is boiling hot--
>And whether pigs have wings.""
