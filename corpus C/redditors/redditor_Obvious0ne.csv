cvwl1p3,1,t3_3oeqyr,Obvious0ne,"This sounds like another social problem that can be solved with meetup.com. find a group of people in your area that go camping and go with them. They can advise you on what to bring for where you'll be going.

Camping is mostly about hanging out with friends around a fire. I love it.


Keep in mind that there are degrees of camping - some people drive an air conditioned RV to a state park (or rent a cabin there), bring a grill and some chairs, and call it camping. Other people backpack way out into the middle of nowhere with minimal gear. I'm somewhere in the middle (though closer to the first, really - I like to bring my guitar and telescope and a bunch of beer & good food...)


I think hunting is a similar thing - it depends a lot on what you're hunting for and where. For dove hunting you just stand in the right field at the right time with a shotgun and blast the things as they fly over. For deer you might set up in a blind, up in a tree, or just on a stool & wait to see if you get a chance to take a shot. Then if you get something you've got to know how to field dress it etc. I haven't done a ton of hunting, but you can probably find a group that wouldn't mind teaching you on meetup as well.",8,0,1444621756,1444723911
cvwkao5,0,t1_cvwjvzu,Obvious0ne,"Depending on the magnification they will take maybe a couple minutes to move across your field of view - so you just nudge the scope a bit once a minute or so.

Note that this is a pretty big scope - look at the dimensions and take a tape measure to get a feel for its size before you buy. It's a fantastic scope, just be prepared for transporting it.

Also, look at getting a Telrad finderscope to help you aim the thing. It's an inexpensive and excellent addition to any telescope. I just got mine and I don't even use the normal finderscope anymore (the normal finder is just a little telescope, which magnifies and flips the image. That makes it hard to look at the sky and say ""I want to point the telescope THERE"" and then successfully do it, because as soon as you look through the finder everything looks different. The Telrad is like a red-dot scope for a gun. It doesn't magnify, it just creates a floating bullseye that helps you point the scope where you want. It usually gets it close enough to see the object in the main scope, or if not you can definitely get it close enough to fine tune with the normal finder.)",2,0,1444620366,1444723911
cvvk7lp,0,t1_cvvhp1k,Obvious0ne,"My two favorites from back in the day were:


1) ""I don't want to lift weights, those things are heavy"" (there is a tiny chance that is actually a Paula Poundstone joke but I think it was Elayne)


2) A story about crossing the street and the light turns green while she is still walking in front of a guy's car. The guy yells ""WHORE!"", so she says back ""What a memory!"". That one doesn't work well in print but her delivery was great.",2,0,1444541050,1444723911
