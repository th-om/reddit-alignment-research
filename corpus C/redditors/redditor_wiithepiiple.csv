> It's the fact that you're publically taking on a submissive stance

What?  How is that submissive?  And why is being submissive bad?

> falling prey to gender stereotypes when you breastfeed.

It's not stereotypes.  If I had breasts that produced food for my child I sure as hell would want my kid fed, especially when there's a long list of benefits of breast milk vs. formula.

> Women aren't cows.

Can't argue with that one.

> We aren't here to feed your offspring.

I sure as hell don't want you feeding mine.  And if you don't want to breastfeed your kids, so be it, but if someone does want to, I don't want the oversexualization of women and breasts to prevent her.  Men sure as hell can walk around without a shirt; why not women?  Female breasts' primary biological function is to feed infants; all of the sexuality we attach to it is secondary.

> We are here to work our jobs and pursue goals far greater than the lot that is forced upon us.

If you want to not have kids and focus on jobs and other goals, that's fine.  If you want to have kids and not breastfeed them, that's fine.  If you want to have kids and not breastfeed them publicly, that's fine too.  If you want to have kids and breastfeed them publicly, I don't want an antiquated view of female's bodies preventing women from taking care of their child.",3,0,1444415260,1444719988
