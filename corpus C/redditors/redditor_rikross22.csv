cvxtgz9,0,t1_cvxri23,rikross22,Yeah I'm very political aware for the United States but I only keep track of who won the elections in major allies/enemies countries. I have no idea what the lead up is only the end result. ,1,1,1444710179,1444716294
cvxtf9a,1,t3_3ojlwm,rikross22,"It's absolutely still needed, the debates that happen on the floor, the discussion of bills and adding of amendments that happens in caucus or in personal meetings, committee meetings and questioning, talking to the executive branch is all easier to do or must be done in person. Not to mention how tricky the time zone differences could be, or if for some reason there was IT problems that caused a senator or representative to miss a vote. ",1,1,1444710082,1444716294
cvxsnzt,0,t1_cvxb52u,rikross22,It doesn't seem reasonable at all and I'd expect an appeal and that ruining to get reversed or at least remanded. ,1,0,1444708560,1444716294
cvxpkl9,1,t3_3oj2p4,rikross22,"Party establishment doesn't want Hillary to be weakened, they want her to come out of the primary with a unified party and as little attacks, damage and money spent as possible. They didn't really get their wish with Sanders but he was harder to control since he isn't exactly close with the party leaders to begin with. I think Democrats realize winning the white house 3 elections in a row is something pretty hard to do (so if you are younger it might be smarter to wait a cycle if Hillary loses or two if she wins) so most have conceded to the most experienced and well supported candidate.

cvxp1df,1,t3_3oepgd,rikross22,"Andrew Jackson is extremely interesting to me. He drastically changed politics in this country and its kinda staggering just how much he changed it. The man openly defied the Supreme Court, broke treaties, strong armed opponents, broke up the political establishment to basically create the Democratic Party, ushered in an era of former generals being elected, broke the mold of old aristocratic presidents being a poorer western who captured the common man vote and simply didn't allow southern states to succeed he pretty much forced them to behave (which probably only made problems worse later on). He might have been a bastard but he's an interesting bastard.  ",1,1,1444702580,1444716294
cvxolvu,0,t1_cvxofdn,rikross22,It is which is why it's pretty easy to disqualify him. But the few times during the last debate that he talked other issues I found him to be reasonable and actually liked how he came off. He openly chastised others like Cruz for trying to shut down the government and went after Santorum as well.  Unfortunately that didn't last long before he was back to his old ways. ,1,1,1444701892,1444716294
cvxoe3l,1,t3_3oj0uq,rikross22,"Trump- no chance in hell. Probably even donate to sanders despite not really supporting him in this match up. 

Santorum- nope right wing populism vs left wing I'm picking left wing. 

Rubio- probably not since he's been more conservative overall, but I'd need to really look into all his stances to make sure. 

Rand Paul- never been a fan of libertarians or hard line libertarians so no. 

Patacki- I'd pretty heavily consider him, he's been more moderate and sounded sane. 

kaisch- same as above. I've liked his rhetoric and what I've seen in Ohio so I'd at least be open 

Jindal- not a chance in hell. Second least liked candidate for me.

Huckabee- nope, I like his personality sometimes but he's way too right on social issues. 

Graham- i like him until he talks about our policies over seas. Then he sounds crazy and I can't imagine him as commander in chief. 

Fiorina- no, I don't care for openly lying about videos and think she's unqualified for the job. 

Cruz- not a chance. 

Chris Christie- I don't like how's he's ran New Jersey and I don't trust him with the whole country. 

Ben Carson- not qualified and his comments have been offensive and idiotic. 

Bush- would consider, I like his softer stances on many things like immigration but most likely still vote sanders. ",1,1,1444701544,1444716294
cvxo20o,0,t1_cvxlx8h,rikross22,"Yeah I was expecting him to say Corey booker, he fits that description much better. ",1,1,1444701018,1444716294
cvxnx6f,0,t1_cvx7guv,rikross22,"Hillary isn't bad at debates, big speeches where she needs to fire up her voting base she lacks because she isn't particularly charismatic but debates she gets to discuss policy and she's really good at that. Id say the debates are going to be her major chance to snuff out the chance sanders has at the nomination, I'm not sure if she will pull it off completely but I don't expect her to go out there and get dominated in terms of performance from anyone. ",1,1,1444700810,1444716294
cvxnlqa,1,t3_3oiw2c,rikross22,"I think a huge part is that she's basically been drug through the mud for decades now, we've heard rumors and allegations since bill's days as the governor of Arkansas. After a while there starts to be a narrative, if that's valid or not. I don't think she's the cleanest politician on some things but I also don't see her as some monster. People seem to forget that politicians, particularly politicians who have been on a nation wide stage, are still people. She's been an incredibly successful woman who's made her own career, been a dedicated public servant and does generally care about how the government is ran in this country. She has her own ambitions of course and has made policy decisions I wish she hadn't but plenty of people change their views with new information and time. I didn't support her in 2008 and I am tepidly supporting her now but the amount of hate she gets I think is unwarranted and a little much. ",1,1,1444700322,1444716294
