For real. I wonder if the actor that plays Nick researched his role by watching Fear and Loathing. His mannerisms are so similar to Depp playing Hunter S Thompson. (see link) and those clothes! It so distracting to me that it slightly compromises the authenticity of his role and makes it harder for me to be emotionally invested in his character. EDIT I want to like him. I really do, I'm excited about his partnership with Strand, I think it will brings more of his character into the light. ",3,0,1444576347,1444728020
cvtibyx,0,t1_cvss0l5,pnumonicstalagmite,"Ugh... I  apologize. You are totally right. My reading comprehension could be much better. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I'm looking for a book on the Trends of Language like you suggested. If you know a good one PM me. Its never to late to learn and I think it would grow me in a lot of different ways if I read more, and wasn't so damn snarky all the time. Sorry for acting like such an asshole.

Oh, and I had to Urban Dictionary [Cherry Boi](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cherry+boy) so I guess we are even :)",2,0,1444317907,1444728020

There are a few that I tend to gravitate towards when I'm feeling a little extra [HBIC](http://gfycat.com/BrilliantWeirdCrocodile). 

**Alkemia**- [Les Mysteres](https://www.etsy.com/listing/90889504/les-mysteres-perfume-oil-5-ml?ref=shop_home_active_16)

**Future Primitive**- [White Witch](http://futureprimitivesoap.co.uk/aromatic-oil-general-catalogue/) (an essential oil blend but the geranium & patchouli oil she uses are really high quality) and it stinks SO good. 

*Honorable Mentions:*
I would also throw in [Le Vie En Rose](http://futureprimitivesoap.co.uk/scent-catalogue/) by Future Primitive but its seasonal and gone now. The first two I listed make me personally feel powerful, but this is one that men compliment me the most on... which I guess would lead to the manhandling?
BPAL's [Morroco](http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/beloved-favorites/morocco/) is good and cozy too. I love how it smells on me, so I guess I would love it on a guy too?
