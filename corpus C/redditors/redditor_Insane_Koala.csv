cve31o1,0,t1_cvdt2bo,Insane_Koala,Ripping a whole country out of the earth will probably have negative consequences on the environment too. I guess there's no perfect solution,1,0,1443209350,1444722519
cvc00uf,0,t1_cvbzs4m,Insane_Koala,"That's exactly how I feel. Towards the end I was getting a ""look how far they've come"" kinda feeling, similar to how I felt near the end of Breaking Bad. It's strange how Varro and even Asher became distant memories despite they're importance earlier in the show. Just amazing.",4,0,1443053179,1444722519
cvbxa3e,0,t1_cvbvnpo,Insane_Koala,I just wanted to tell someone who would appreciate it. None of my friends watch the show. That is it. Do you remember how you felt after finishing War of the Damned for the first time? I was super pumped!,4,0,1443048330,1444722519
cvbjuoe,0,t1_cvbj5x6,Insane_Koala,"I completely agree! Totally recommending it to my friends, especially now that I've seen all of it.",5,0,1443028803,1444722519

cv9m82q,0,t1_cv9irn8,Insane_Koala,"Yeah, edibles is definitely the way to go. I would also like to add that vaping is probably fine too, since there are no biproducts of combustion for the cilia to deal with.",2,0,1442879810,1444722519
cv05696,0,t1_cv04tai,Insane_Koala,"So you're contradicting what I said by replacing the word ""high"" with ""drunk"" to make my point sound ridiculous. You realize that being drunk and being high are very different though, right? That's like replacing each usage of the word ""high"" with ""gloomy"" or ""anxious"". Of course you shouldn't drive drunk, there's a strong correlation between driving drunk and crashing. It has no impact on driving high though, so although I understand the point you're trying to make (comparing driving high to driving drunk) I am sorry to say that you simply misunderstand how these chemicals affect the mind and you're using that misunderstanding to support your claims.",1,0,1442163222,1444722519
cv0496z,0,t1_cv03vsy,Insane_Koala,"The point is that driving high isn't dangerous unless the person driving is driving poorly. I know a guy who put it ""if i can feel my legs, i can drive"" and he was right. Some people can't drive high, and I hope they stay off the road. However, making a blanket statement saying nobody should drive high is ignorant.",0,0,1442161663,1444722519
