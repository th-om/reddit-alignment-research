No, you're not going to be able to push a constant 60 fps out of a completely unoptimized alpha of a cutting edge game, even with the best hardware available right now.",0,0,1444712406,1444730304

cvxrlb1,0,t1_cvxqoee,DarraignTheSane,"There's been a lot said about various living mechanics (sleeping, eating, even hygiene stuff), but it's still all really being worked out and probably will continue to be until much closer to launch.

For ships that don't have a bed, the one thing that seems to be fairly certain is that you won't want to log out in the middle of even mildly iffy space, much less anywhere that's actually hostile.  A bed is supposed give you the ability to sleep and log out without having to return to a carrier ship or planet/spacestation/etc.

Single seat fighters are meant to be just that - you fly out from somewhere, attack something, then fly back and get out of the ship.",1,0,1444706669,1444730304
cvxqc7m,1,t3_3oj4lh,DarraignTheSane,"The Avenger is a more all-around ship that serves multiple roles and is even getting a two seater variant soon.  You can haul a little cargo, capture a few bounties, and sleep in it too.

The Sabre is a single-person fighter, with no other space inside the ship aside from the cockpit.  It's strictly a fighter and nothing else.

So no, you didn't mess up.  You've got one ""get around"" ship, and one fighter.",1,0,1444704611,1444730304
