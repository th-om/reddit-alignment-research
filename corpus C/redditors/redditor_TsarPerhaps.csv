cvxk3u7,1,t3_3oif49,TsarPerhaps,"I do not like Sanders. However, if by an act of God he gets the nomination, it might be a young, minority candidate. Maybe Deval Patrick. ",2,0,1444694936,1444716945

cvxcj26,1,t3_3oh49y,TsarPerhaps,"I don't think Snowden and Assange are dumb enough to bite the hands that keep them out of Leavenworth. As for Greenwald, I honestly don't know enough about him to comment. ",0,0,1444683043,1444716945
cvxc8a0,0,t1_cvx0orr,TsarPerhaps,"Instead, we'll have JFK, and maybe FDR. Mentioned, but probably not spun around as much as Reagan was in the GOP Debate. ",1,0,1444682617,1444716945
cvxc564,0,t1_cvxbp5f,TsarPerhaps,"I just think he has a better chance at using the debate to get into a solid 3rd Place. Better than O'Malley, Lessig, or Chaffee. As I'd think he'd appeal to more moderate Democrats thrown off by Clinton. ",2,0,1444682493,1444716945
cvx4xw2,1,t3_3ognso,TsarPerhaps,"While I'm not fond of the man, Sanders will rise some in the polls, given the exposure the debate will give him. Clinton will stay on top, though will suffer some. Though if she looses too much, the DNC will probably panic and draft Biden. Webb, I partially think, and partially hope, will come out in third, gaining around 10 to 15%. O'Malley and Chaffee are done. Debate or no debate. ",4,0,1444672191,1444716945
cvx42n3,1,t3_3oepgd,TsarPerhaps,"I am fascinated by Thomas E. Dewey, a man who, in his '30s, prosecuted gangsters (The Mob considered killing him, once), and crippled the Nazi German-American Bund as a special prosecutor under the Mayor of NYC. 

As a Republican, he managed to be elected as DA of Manhattan, Governor of New York (In his early '40s), ran for President four times, almost beating Truman. By all means, he was an extremely effective, honest man, able to hold firm to his positions and lead the moderate Eastern Establishment. Even being fundamental into drafting Eisenhower to the GOP nomination and victory. ",1,0,1444670941,1444716945
cvwv494,1,t3_3of77z,TsarPerhaps,It's funny how the author notes Ross Perot's United We Stand Campaign as one counter-example to Trump and the Kochs. Trump was a member of Perot's own Reform Party for a couple of years. Even ran for President as a member in 2000. ,1,0,1444655198,1444716945
