cvqsglb,1,t3_3nrar9,Interestedpartygoer,"Well, the Knight of Faith by definition places absolute faith in God, so on the face of it I would have to say no, as faith is (arguably) predicated upon belief. 

However I suppose it could be argued that believing in God and having faith in God are distinct concepts, and from there some affirmative answer could be derived. If we took ""believing"" to mean a sort of empirically-based assent, and ""faith"" as a more abstract kind of trust, then perhaps so. Kierkegaard's schtick was that one's faith in God should not rely on a factual understanding, as God is totally above and beyond the human capacity to understand. The question of God's existence would then be irrelevant to us, as any human response to it would, by it's very nature, fail. 

I could imagine a Knight of Faith who saw no factual basis for God whatsoever (or even was an overt atheist) and still, somehow, was able to place total trust in God. It seems highly implausible, but then again so do a lot of things.

The real problem with american politics (and I imagine all modern democratic political systems) is the influence of money and private interest on public policy.  ",3,0,1441616207,1444722515

cu2m67a,0,t1_cu2jubh,Interestedpartygoer,"Determinism vs. Free Will. Classic philosophical debate. Tons of literature on the subject from all kinds of different angles, particularly  religious ones for obvious reasons. The issue being that if God or what have you made everything perfectly and with full knowledge of events before they transpire, how is it that we are able to choose (or, in different circles, feel that we are able)? Shouldn't our every action simply flow forth into the stream of time? Is our consciousness the problem? How does this dilemma influence morality and ethics? Is the idea of God itself problematic and therefore to blame? Is the mind of the creator knowable, such that we can even grasp a part of the answer? Or is such knowledge by definition unobtainable, the m.o. of the divine being totally foreign to us mere mortals?  ",6,0,1439545645,1444722515
