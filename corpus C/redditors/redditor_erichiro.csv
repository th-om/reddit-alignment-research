Perhaps she can buy you something else that's luxurious but not as expensive as a car and then use the rest of the money to help pay off loans.,2,0,1444507254,1444728034
cvuy0xd,1,t3_3o1jq5,erichiro,"Some people assert that Clinton should have called in the military to try and defend the embassy.

Clinton says military intervention was impossible because the military was too far away.

This is the main issue but then there are lots of related issues. 

Did Secretary Clinton make a mistake in opening the Libyan embassy too soon and in not providing adequate protection?

Why did the administration falsely claim the attack was a spontaneous riot about an offensive video instead of a planned terrorist attack?",2,0,1444498750,1444728034
cvuxqam,1,t3_3o31qc,erichiro,"In California they have open primaries which means the top two vote getters, regardless of party, will face off in the general election. This means in highly democratic districts and highly republican districts there can be two people from the same party. 

It also means that a party can be hurt if too many people try running for office. For example lets pretend that a district is 60% democrat, 40% republican, there are two republicans in the race and six democrats. Each of the republicans get 20% and each of the democrats get 10%. So the general election will have two republicans and the democrats will be completely shut out.",2,0,1444498222,1444728034
