cvx7f91,0,t1_cvx6i0i,The_Juggler17,"> I seem to recall when my wife was unemployed, she only had to sign into a website.

Yeah, it was like that for me, I was unemployed a few months ago.

You have to say that you did *something* which can be just contacting an employer or submitting an application. There has to be at least one thing in a week. It's pretty relaxed, just doing one thing of some kind doesn't take much work.",5,0,1444675763,1444730106
cvx673p,0,t1_cvwze0c,The_Juggler17,"I feel like maybe all of these cases were people who needed to have a job interview for some reason or another, but didn't want the job. Just act stupid in the interview and you won't be hired.

Like some unemployment programs, job placement, parole and stuff like that will sometimes require you to prove that you're at getting interviews.",3,0,1444673999,1444730106
cvx5zm9,0,t1_cvx2m9w,The_Juggler17,"> they digitized the notes to fit the music. There are a few moments when you can hear the differences in the vocal tones of The Diva's voice.

And that's cool because it makes her sound truly alien, like this alien creature has some kind of vocal capability beyond that of a human.",122,0,1444673702,1444730106

cvx59bb,0,t1_cvwwquo,The_Juggler17,"I'm not proud of it, don't brag about it, but I drive a little buzzed pretty often. Like I'm definitely over the legal limit, but not too impaired, certainly not legal though.

.

I think it should be a secondary offense - like you shouldn't be arrested for *just* drunk driving. If you do something else (reckless driving, collision, speeding, etc) and you're also drunk then yeah you should be in huge trouble. But if you're not impaired then I don't think it should be illegal.",-2,0,1444672645,1444730106
cvx0m12,1,t3_3ogbw5,The_Juggler17,">I need the SSD only for the OS. Programs and files will be stored on my 2TB Hard Drive.

Yeah that's the way to do it, and one of the complications of using one too. Make sure that everything in your user profile (My Documents, My Pictures, etc) is mapped to the traditional hard drive - even the Desktop should be mapped to the secondary drive. 

Also, some programs can be installed on the SSD. Anything you want to run really fast (and have the space for). MS Office, most games, Photoshop - those kinds of things benefit from being installed on the SSD. They load real damn snappy.",1,0,1444665616,1444730106
cvwykhr,0,t1_cvwwk8s,The_Juggler17,"Although the conservative media and politicians talk about almost none of those things.

They're too focused on making up absolute lies and then investigating those stories, trying to repeal the healthcare act, talking about the president's birth certificate, and criticizing his wife's fashion choices.

The real problems, they barely talk about them.",3,0,1444662235,1444730106
cvwyfrs,0,t1_cvwvzph,The_Juggler17,"I mean, seriously, some things are just as simple as this.

Not saying this is what it all boils down to, but I think it has always been a huge factor. Just have to imagine some of the shit they throw at Obama wouldn't be said of a white man.",8,0,1444662003,1444730106
cvwxywe,0,t1_cvwpjkv,The_Juggler17,"There are legitimate criticisms against Obama - and the conservative media talks about none of them.

Instead of talking about why we *still* spend *trillions* on endless war, they talk about his birth certificate. Instead of talking about unchecked expansion of state surveillance, they make up stories and then investigate those stories. Instead of talking about the persecution of whistleblowers and the wrongdoing they've exposed, they talk about his wife's fashion choices.

Some of the things blamed on the president aren't really his fault, they're the fault of Congress or his administration. But some of them *absolutely are* his fault and he should be blamed for him.

But it seems all anybody wants to talk about is hyperbole and absolute lies.",48,0,1444661175,1444730106
