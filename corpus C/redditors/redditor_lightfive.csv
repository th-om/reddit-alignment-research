cvx8lsx,1,t3_3ogw65,lightfive,I found it kinds entertaining. Worth reading if you want to kill some time IMHO.,2,0,1444677474,1444725207

cvx8cor,0,t1_cvx041a,lightfive,Man I love doing this to troll the enemy team. They never expect this and AP on Xin isn't that bad.,1,0,1444677112,1444725207
cvx89gm,1,t3_3ogt0k,lightfive,well... the question is do we really want Vel'Koz to be one of deadliest mages in the first place?,1,0,1444676982,1444725207
cvx875e,1,t3_3oh0bq,lightfive,"Man, I'm such a hipster I used to run tp mid before it was cool.

Seriously though, use tp yourself? It's a very good spell right now so why not taking advantage of that too? ",1,0,1444676887,1444725207

cvx845s,0,t1_cvx3o8b,lightfive,"Nah, just take a break. If you're on a losing streak, play a few normals or ARAMS and come back to ranked later. ",1,0,1444676767,1444725207
cvx7z00,0,t1_cvx4089,lightfive,"I'd go for Morde the time being, then try out Nidalee because she's more versatile than Kat. While it's easy to pick up multi kills with Kat she's somewhat lacking the current meta. If you're getting decent at Nid you're having a better time than playing Kat. 

Especially when your mindset is that she's the easiest champion to get penta kills with. Yes, it might be easier than Nid but more often than not you're getting shut down before, especially if your engage is overzealous. ",1,0,1444676555,1444725207
cvx7ihj,0,t1_cvx792r,lightfive,"tl;dr: Team is fine, maybe needs new adc, Loco should be more of a coach and needs to be more of an authority figure, Reginald should focus on running the organization.",1,0,1444675893,1444725207
cvx7954,0,t1_cvx6ux3,lightfive,I'm going positive on TT and still get matched with bots. ,1,0,1444675515,1444725207
