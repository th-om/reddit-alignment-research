cvuae14,0,t1_cvu977u,obeetwo2,"There are some that are naturally gifted, being a sports analyst I see this all the time. It's a combination of practice and raw talent, Michael Phelps great swimmer, has put in thousands, tens of thousands of hours of work but you have to look at everything that contributed besides talent. A much larger arm span than the average person of his height, a long torso and large hands. These are physical things he was gifted with, as there are mental things as well. The ability to stay calm and collective on high stress environments and to analyze situations accordingly. I'm sure there are people just as motivated ad hai, have had more practice than hai and are smarter than hai. Yet nobody is on his level.",1,0,1444433777,1444719659
cvu8x9d,0,t1_cvu8kpq,obeetwo2,"I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying there's an aspect that's just natural to a player, and it's something that they just have. 

Do you watch football? ever watch Russell Wilson play qb? here's a QB that can barely see over his line, he was picked in the third draft because of his height mainly. Russell has a high release point, he can hit a coin with a football 40 yards away, that can be taught or learned from practice. Russell has a unique gift to keep the play going, he's known for having plays that last 13, 14, 15 seconds long instead of the regular 5  seconds. His evasiveness and ability to draw out plays while looking down field is something that you can try to teach, but it's more of a gift. Does that mean there will be nobody else that can do that? no but it means it's a gift that few people have and you don't just tell someone how to do it and they know. 

We can go onto a different example, ancient warfare. Hannibal had a way of using tons of different mercenaries in unique ways, he saw that battlefield nobody else could. He utilized his strengths and punished the Romans who had larger, veteran armies fighting in their own land. Does it mean there will never be a general like that again? no it can be done, but if you look at westpoint you don't see all these Hannibal-like leaders. Hannibal had a gift that maybe on Alexander the great could have competed with. 

The point is, yes maybe there will be a better shot caller than Hai, but the talent is a gift not something you can teach anybody. CLG EU started a ton of different ways to play the game, counter jungling is a prime example, I can tell you how to counter jungle and in 10 games you'd be decent at it, that's something you can teach another and just because it hadn't been done doesnt mean they couldn't do it. You can't do that with Hai's shotcalling.",1,0,1444431069,1444719659
cvu7z4f,0,t1_cvu7mea,obeetwo2,"I understand what you're saying, but still if it could be taught I'd bet there would be more shot callers like that. His understanding of the game, rotations and opportunity costs are unmatched and I think that's something that may be able to be taught but not to the extent Hai has.",7,0,1444429376,1444719659
cvu5slp,0,t1_cvu5k7e,obeetwo2,"I don't think anybody can compare to Hai's shot calling. It's something that can't be coached and he's just a natural at. It's an example that teams don't need to be a bunch of super teams, but everyone of them trusts Hai's calls and holds their own in lane and it works out.",34,0,1444425699,1444719659
