cvxps10,0,t1_cvxkxev,Seakawn,"A couple questions.

1. What were the ages? Of when shit happened, and when shit finally resolved?

2. You say you resorted to a drug to make things easier. In this case, alcohol, and the alcohol was destructive I guess? What is your experience with marijuana? Did that help or make things worse?

I become an alcoholic (not a terrible one, I don't often get drunk, but drink about every night regardless) when my days aren't exhausting enough to pass me out at night from sobriety. However, when I have access to good bud, I avoid alcohol like the plague and end up feeling much better for it. It doesn't seem to be some impediment or dysfunction to my life. And apparently microdosing drugs like psilocybin is a productive thing to do for pain.",1,0,1444703702,1444719375
cvxp7nx,0,t1_cvxockn,Seakawn,"I think some illegal psychoactive drugs are good treatments for cluster headaches. But, you know, they're illegal, so, they must not have any medical benefits. Sorry, clustache people!",2,0,1444702848,1444719375
cvxoau5,0,t1_cvxhgz8,Seakawn,"There's also a big problem with Christians who pay taxes that go towards food stamps because they think most if not all people who take advantage of food stamps abuse the system.

These are the same Christians who would love to do away with such system or see it regulated so far that it would even take away benefits from those who truly need and benefit from it. These are a lot of Christians--enough that need to be accounted and spoken for.",2,0,1444701398,1444719375
cvxo578,0,t1_cvxgsou,Seakawn,">I doubt I could convince you otherwise without spending more time in this conversation than I want to.

Is that akin to,

>I could convince you if I cared enough to change your mind.

?

Why don't you care enough? And if that's not analogous, then why not?",1,0,1444701149,1444719375
cvxo2y2,0,t1_cvxcy8l,Seakawn,"> If you ask ""Are you helping the poor?,"" you will likely find many more who are unable to answer with an honest yes.

Many people will honestly answer yes because they've occasionally donated a few bucks to their church offering at some points in their life.

The real question of significance should be, ""Are you significantly helping the poor?"" That's where you'll find a lack of honest positive response.",1,0,1444701055,1444719375
cvxnywl,0,t1_cvxfxap,Seakawn,"Okay, sure. So you're able to line up a chronology of when and from who the sentiment of the golden rule came into human recording and was consequentially reflected upon over time? Basically, a source for its origin, and then sources of where it was repeated from different places and times?

I was under the impression the golden rule and general empathetic logic predated Christian doctrine. I'd like to see a list of dates and documents that show otherwise.",2,0,1444700885,1444719375
cvxns4n,0,t1_cvxk6nw,Seakawn,">Yeah, once again, you're simply trying to sound holier than thou.

If you had logic on your side then this wouldn't be an important enough point to acknowledge. What makes you compelled to point out that you think they're merely trying to act ""holier than thou?"" And why do you think such a statement is relevant to make in light of the argument and the evidence toward each side?

I just really am dumbfounded as to how somebody who is rationally correct needs to point something out that's so trite and expect it to be worthwhile to the discussion. But I could be naive, which is why I'm asking you for your input. I'm definitely willing to consider that you might have a good point to make by saying that.",2,0,1444700594,1444719375
cvxnm5l,0,t1_cvxmrhx,Seakawn,Which scholars? I'm assuming you must have sources to say such a thing. But of course this is giving you benefit of the doubt... which may be too lenient if you can't actually respond with some sources from these scholars.,2,0,1444700342,1444719375
