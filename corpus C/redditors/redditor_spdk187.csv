cvno0zo,1,t3_3nfv0d,spdk187,"Just a few observations, I'm about the same age, but I can tell there's a difference from when I was in college:

-------------------------------------------

Music shifted back into being electronic after the 90's deemed synthesizers passe - thus tons of other music borrows heavily from 80's music or rave music. EDM gets played on mainstream radio, which didn't happen much after the early 90's.

----------------------------------------

Tons of folks don't trust mainstream news outlets and for better or for worse, get info from unofficial channels. The has caused journalism to crash and burn and shift to yellow journalism to get readers, and for more folks to trust REALLY untrustworthy outlets. After 9/11 happened conspiracy theorists started infiltrating the mainstream.  

------------------------------

I think that we are far less nationalistic as a whole now, and many think of things on a global scale and consume products that way as well. People eat ""ethnic food"" watch foreign TV, and read international blogs, news, podcasts etc.

------------------------------

Social media is all over the place, I'm not even sure ""freindster"" was a thing back then.

------------------------------

Polarization - I do not remember a time more polarized culturally and politically than right now, civil discourse seems to be impossible and folks end up in opposing camps... hope this changes soon.",8,0,1443957360,1444719579
