cvswadw,0,t1_cvsreds,TheJuBe,"I think was is confusing about the image is that it seems to equivocate irrational hysteria with a rational call to action. It's not so much about the image being right or wrong, as it is befuddling as a political cartoon because it doesn't really offer up a point as it much as it is a realist portrait (not in the sense of style, but its message). The best analogy that I can think of at the moment, is that inspires the same confusion I feel for when people get super pumped about the status quo...it just doesn't pack a punch.",4,0,1444335839,1444723926
