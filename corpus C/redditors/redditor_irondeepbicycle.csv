cvwqmy6,0,t1_cvwp6ad,irondeepbicycle,"> NAFTA has, according to almost anyone you ask, conservative or liberal, harmed America.

And about a third of Americans reject evolution outright, it doesn't mean their views mean anything.  Economists [universally support NAFTA](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_0dfr9yjnDcLh17m), and it's best to stick with the experts when it comes to questions of public policy.",2,0,1444638001,1444718230
cvwmjnw,0,t1_cvwm8uh,irondeepbicycle,"And Mexican manufacturing boomed.  One can't happen without the other.

You'll notice that arguments against free trade don't argue that it's bad for a country in general, but in a specific industry.  NAFTA was bad for American *manufacturing*, it was bad for Mexican *corn farmers*, etc.  It's natural in trade that not everyone is a winner, but the gains outweigh the losses.

And I had a feeling that EPI is what would be cited, so I want to point out that 1) Trade deficits are largely decided in asset markets, and have essentially nothing to do the a well-negotiated trade agreement, and 2) Even if they were, [trade deficits don't lead to unemployment](https://hbr.org/1996/01/a-country-is-not-a-company).",5,0,1444625079,1444718230

1) I'm not enthused about Sanders, the only position of his I really like is his climate change position.  

2) Tariff reduction is good, regulatory harmonization is good, dispute resolution is good, IP is kinda meh but I think concerns are overblown.  It probably won't have much effect over the next 10 years but longer term effects could be massive, depending on which other countries join it.  If TTIP also passes and the next President takes another crack at FTAA, that's just about every major world economy in a single free trade area.",2,0,1444621269,1444718230
