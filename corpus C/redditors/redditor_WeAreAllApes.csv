It doesn't have to be bad, but our model of ""growth"" will change long before our galaxy dies of ""natural"" causes.",1,0,1444374038,1444719086
cvtgsln,0,t1_cvtgaar,WeAreAllApes,"It's not a question of what drives growth, but what is the result of growth. Ultimately, we will either have a steady state economy OR energy and raw material must or grow to 99.99999% of GDP (by current measures) OR the concept of currency that translates between energy and raw material and intellectual property goes away.... Something has to give. The economist's claim that energy will get cheaper can't hold, despite the trend, and neither can the trend of energy as percentage of GDP.",1,0,1444373826,1444719086
cvtfwz0,0,t1_cvteib3,WeAreAllApes,"I think it will be increasingly necessary to view the economy that way, yes, but.... this was an actual conversation.

So you don't agree with the approach that economist took in the conversation, but can you give specifics other than to say the whole thing is a straw man? Or at the point where they talk about the lower bound of energy as a percentage of GDP, you would have just called the physicist an idiot and not tried to give a serious answer?",1,0,1444370977,1444719086

Edit 2: Did you really not find it interesting and thought provoking? Pick a place in the dialog after the first 1/3 and let me know what question or point you would have made as the economist.",1,0,1444366758,1444719086

cvt6gfj,0,t1_cvt5mro,WeAreAllApes,"I rhetoric among the right, perhaps, but _in practice_ Hillary is much more active in persuing gun control and interested in much stricter policies (for reference, I am a liberal/progressive, but I am a gun owner and I thinks she goes too far). She already called Bernie our multiple times for being too soft on guns -- so in that sense, she would be much better for gun sales. On the other hand, the NRA is run by manufacturers, so the are going to say the same thing about _anyone_ with less than perfect rating from them in hopes of driving sales, regardless of that person's actual position.",1,0,1444352352,1444719086
