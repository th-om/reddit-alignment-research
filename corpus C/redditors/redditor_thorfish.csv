cv96yvc,1,t3_3lnheb,thorfish,"As a percentage of the population, more black people die at the hand of the police than do white people. But as a percentage of violent crimes committed, just as high a percentage of white people are killed by the police (see here for a fuller discussion of this issue - http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/25/race-and-justice-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/ ). And we would expect police homicides to correlate more with crime than with population (since crime is when the police get involved). Most people killed by the police are not innocent. Something like 80% are armed, and even some of the others are threatening the police.

In any situation in which an armed outsider needs to come in to quell violence and make arrests, the armed outsider is going to make mistakes. Could there be fewer mistakes? Probably. I think bodycams are a good idea. But at some point you reach a point of diminishing returns, and the police will have their hands tied so much that they simply will stop policing the most dangerous neighborhoods. Crime in Baltimore and St. Louis has gone way home since this issue has exploded on the national scene.

Also, the more violent the neighborhood, the harder it is to get decent cops to want to patrol the streets. And the more itchy their trigger finger will be. What person with options would want to be a beat cop in West Baltimore? Thus the beat cops tend to be only a little better than the violent thugs on the street corners.

Thus the best way to reduce police shootings would be to get the crime rate down. Not only that, since 100X as many black people die from homicide as do die from wrongful police shootings, getting the crime rate down would save more black lives as a first order effect.

culaecd,0,t1_cul2epy,thorfish,"> and the idea that we can just apply indiscriminate and overwhelming force to a country universally known for its unique difficulty to invade and occupy seems sort of backwards to me.

I'm not sure what the author means by the Imperialist playbook, but historically, in most cases, imperialism did not mean applying indiscriminate force. The traditional tactics were indirect rule and/or having a native army with an imperialist officer corp. So rather than pretend the Afghan army is a partner, and then refusing to give them hard orders, and then having to send U.S. marines door-to-door when the Afghan army proved useless, the U.S. would recruit Afghans into an army run by U.S. officers, and then subject the recruited soldiers to stringent discipline. The Afghans then do all the door-to-door policing, which is a lot cheaper, scalable, and sustainable.

With indirect rule, you try to co-opt the natives rather than defeating them. You may even let the Taliban insurgents rule certain areas -- as long as they agree to certain restrictions and demands. Theoretically, there should be common ground for a negotiated settlement. 

Now the author does imply that the rules of engagement should have been reduced. I'm not sure about that one, I can see the pros and cons on both sides. (Con - more civilians get bombed, civilians start to hate Americans. Pro - if it makes the war end sooner, then on net civilian lives might be saved).

> tl;dr if you have a choice between ensuring security using a huge fucking stick or trying to make friends, you're better off making friends (unless your stick is a thermonuclear warhead). But if you're trying to make friends, you have to fucking commit to it 100%.

Well, for my part, I would say the best thing would have been to cut-and-run. I don't think trying to make friends works at all. The population cares first and foremost about who is eventually going to win. That is all that matters. A normal person just needs to back the eventual winner, or they will necessarily face severe retribution, as pointed out in the article. So unless the U.S. was going to pledge to stay there forever, which it was not politically possible nor in the interests of the U.S. to do, then better to just leave as soon as possible, since any further occupation just incurs further violence, spreads the ground with more landlines, and delays the final settlement.

cul1m1d,0,t1_cukqp4n,thorfish,"> The idea that establishing warlords or crushing Afghanistan into the dirt then 'getting the heck out' would somehow magically lead to a stable solution is just swinging too far in the other direction. 

So you oppose what America actually did, and you oppose the imperialist playbook, and you oppose a quick war to root out the camps and then getting out. So what is the fourth way that you envision, that would be better for America and more humane to the Afghans?",1,0,1440963924,1444726448
cuk5wm8,1,t3_3iw83y,thorfish,"This article uses a number of excerpts from journalist Ben Andersonâ€™s book *No Worse Enemy* to highlight the specific follies of the U.S. in Afghanistan. The key and interesting points are that the delusional assumptions behind the occupation strategy made achieving the goals impossible. For instance the delusional, official line that the Afghan military was an equal partner, made it impossible to actually use command-and-control to make the Afghan military a viable, free-standing force. The excerpts and author's analysis also demonstrates how insane it is to try to win hearts and minds, when your mere presence means war, chaos, deaths from landmines, and crime at the hands of imported soldiers from other tribes. The problems of war are probably well known to the members of this subreddit, but the specific anecdotes are still very interesting and revealing.

If anyone should be wary of the intentions of the founders, it is the shareholders. The founders have an incentive to keep profits in the company, so they can use it for their benevolent activities, rather than returning it to the shareholders.

That said...I am reminded of a good exchange, from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. In this fan-fiction, Harry Potter plays the role of a wizard who wants to combine the powers of science and magic to do incredible things for the world, and evil Professor Quirrel is trying to turn him to the dark side:

> ""In any case, Mr. Potter, you have not answered my original question,"" said Professor Quirrell finally. ""What is your ambition?""
>
> ""Oh,"" said Harry. ""Um.."" He organized his thoughts. ""To understand everything important there is to know about the universe, apply that knowledge to become omnipotent, and use that power to rewrite reality because I have some objections to the way it works now.""
>
> There was a slight pause.
> 
> ""Forgive me if this is a stupid question, Mr. Potter,"" said Professor Quirrell, ""but are you sure you did not just confess to wanting to be a Dark Lord?""
>
> ""That's only if you use your power for evil,"" explained Harry. ""If you use the power for good, you're a Light Lord."" 
>
> ""I see,"" Professor Quirrell said. He tapped his other cheek with a finger. ""I suppose I can work with that. But Mr. Potter, while the scope of your ambition is worthy of Salazar himself, how exactly do you propose to go about it?""

Declining fertility and depopulation has meant that entire villages lie abandoned, and can be bought for cheap. The two things I found interesting are the existence of this trend - what does it mean for the future of Spain? For Europe? Second, is there an opportunity where these villages be bought up and redeveloped? A universal basic income combined with an intentional community in a beautiful village might be pretty sweet. Even without universal basic income, if the cost of living is cheap enough, these could become retirement communities for people who save a lot of money and want to retire really early.",2,0,1439408616,1444726448

An Australian visitor is shocked at worn out Americans seem, and how trapped they seem with regards to vacation time. I used to be more free market on this topic. If people want more vacation time, why not just to negotiate for a slightly lower wage and more vacation time? Why does the government need to say you have to take more vacation? Now I see it as a collective action problem. At my last job, all the sales team had to work constantly, because the sales team for our competitors also worked constantly. But if the other sales teams, and our customers, were all on break during August, then it would be win-win. It is a classic prisoner's dilemma. Mandatory vacation time is the win-win quadrant.
