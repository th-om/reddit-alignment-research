cvpj4sc,0,t1_cvpj03s,shoogenboogen,"You misquoted me. There doesn't **have** to be any negatives. That is what is so great about net benefits. You can take some of those benefits, and redistribute them so that all of the losers are even or better off, and still have a benefit left over that you didn't have before. 

And every single observer agrees that there will be net benefits.",0,0,1444090333,1444718494
cvpilbo,0,t1_cvpgaf3,shoogenboogen,"But there doesn't have to be any negatives. Like a said above, there are policies that can be enacted supplementally that could ensure a pure benefit.

Also, I like how net economic gains are fake positives.",0,0,1444089362,1444718494
cvpijp7,0,t1_cvpif1c,shoogenboogen,"What I am saying is that the TPP could not possibly deal with domestic welfare legislation, nor should it. Each country is different and should proceed how they see fit. 

I would fully support legislation immediately, before the TPP officially passes, that deals with the distributional losers (which are almost always present in any kind of policy really)",-1,0,1444089282,1444718494

cvpf7kw,0,t1_cvpf3zt,shoogenboogen,"But why do all of the benefits have to go to rich people? Let's say in response, taxes are raised on the rich so that they are paying more in taxes than before, but less than they benefited from the TPP. Then congress can use the extra tax revenue to benefit the poor, and everyone comes out ahead.

To me, net benefits are the most important variable.",0,0,1444083466,1444718494
cvpf3nd,0,t1_cvpew2c,shoogenboogen,"Why should it be scrapped?

Here is the basis of my argument: everyone agrees the TPP will produce net benefits.

And everyone agrees there will be some losers.

If you take some of those net benefits to help the losers come out even or better, then the result is pure benefit.

Why should we lose out on that benefit?",-1,0,1444083280,1444718494
cvpek40,0,t1_cvpeeor,shoogenboogen,"So this huge international deal should further impede domestic governments from pursuing sensible, domestic-oriented legislation? That is like the main complaint against the TPP. And forgive me for thinking that Brunei and the U.S. have different domestic policy agendas.

And do you understand what scrapping the TPP at this stage would mean? It took 8 years with plenty of all day over night, fierce negotiations. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity that should absolutely not be scrapped.

cvpe90r,0,t1_cvpe47q,shoogenboogen,"Haha well I think it's gymnastics to ignore the other 11 countries to the deal.

But in any case, I would support the deal even if it hurts the American middle class in the short term.

My ideology is the greatest amount of net benefits should be pursued as an upfront policy, and then secondary backdoor measures should be implemented to deal with the distributionary losers. That is how the most progress is achieved -- to me the absolute most important policy ideal -- and people are taken care of. So the TPP should be accompanied by an increase in welfare, retraining, basic income, etc. but should not itself be scrapped.",-1,0,1444081873,1444718494
