cvxtx8c,1,t3_3ohfjg,MollyTamale,"Since it's on Saturday this year I would say Port Townsend for sure.  The kids and parents line up downtown by the Bank of America and parade down main street.  You could be down there for an hour easily, hitting all the stores and seeing everyone in their costumes.  PT is a playful, artistic town and Halloween is a lot of fun for the kids.  A lot of people end up going to dinner in full costume, the kids get a LOT of loot.  There's a neighborhood uptown called Blaine Street (at Tyler) that some years has a big thing going on.  LOTS of great trick or treating in the uptown area, all those great Victorian houses.",1,0,1444711134,1444732226

cvpto0q,1,t3_3no0af,MollyTamale,"Depends on the material. If it were natural fiber like 100% cotton (stitching included) you could maybe bleach but that can damage fabric. There are fabric specific spray paints used in upholstery but it seems like changing from one primary color to another would only be possible with very thick paint that would change the texture and maybe cause a problem, if softness or flexibility are important.

cvmret1,1,t3_3nbnf2,MollyTamale,"It would seem like the concept of decluttering would include reusable shopping bags.  Why create a zone for/method of dealing with an item you can avoid in the first place?  I say this as a person with lots of cloth shopping bags who still collects the occasional usable plastic bag, they go in a spot in the pantry but I don't have so many they need a special method of folding to save more in the space.  I used to collect collect collect but I realized I never need more than a couple and the huge back stock is unnecessary.  But that's the psychological part of being OK with less that's not always evident.",23,0,1443883976,1444732226

In short, the foundation of morality sets a person up to have conservative/liberal ideals,  the video describes a 5 channel morality and how people who are conservative tend to feel strongly about all 5 channels while liberals are passionate more about just a couple/few and discard the others.",13,0,1441546953,1444732226
