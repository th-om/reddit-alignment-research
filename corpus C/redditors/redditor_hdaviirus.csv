cvmbo0g,0,t1_cvm65q0,hdaviirus,"So basically, to be a Democrat... he has to switch sides and change all of his positions.

I can also say that about every other Republican candidate... ""Jeb could be a democrat if..."" or ""Carson could be a democrat if...""",1,0,1443833486,1444725904
cvm5pbh,0,t1_cvm5ctn,hdaviirus,"He is pro-Life

He has a tax plan the Democrats disagree with

He is  anti-Gay

He is known to make misogynistic comments

He is pro-capital punishment

He is against Marijuana Legalization (recreational)

He is against the notion of man made climate change

He is against Gun Control

He is basically anti-vaccine

He is SUPER xenophobic/anti-immigrant.

... I don't think he would do too hot in the democratic primary.",4,0,1443822061,1444725904
cvm55l1,0,t1_cvm3u2f,hdaviirus,"There is no way he would get even close to 25% in the Democratic primary, just because 32% of Democrats believe in ending birthright citizenship doesn't mean that they would all automatically go to Trump, especially because I bet they don't agree with much of the other 95% of his platform. Plus, I bet those democrats don't even feel too strongly about the issue for them to switch from Hilary, Bernie, or Biden to Trump.

The average Democrat and Trump are too different ideologically, and that isn't even counting the fact that he offends much of the party with his explosive rhetoric. ",6,0,1443821127,1444725904
cvm4ykz,1,t3_3n9tko,hdaviirus,"Amongst the current field with no weapons or any other advantages?

It surely has to be Rubio or Cruz. The whole democratic field is pretty old and I doubt they have much of a shot. The republican field is old too, but Cruz and Rubio are younger then the rest so one of them would probably take the cake.",1,0,1443820802,1444725904

I can almost guarantee that in 20 or 30 years all the mention it will get is a CNN or History Channel documentary, people will barely remember and back to the main topic of discussion, nobody will put it in the context of Obama's legacy.",2,0,1442875498,1444725904
cv9jmkj,0,t1_cv9frlv,hdaviirus,"> What? Are you serious? Just because an attack isn't on the level of 9/11 doesn't mean it's not major. People still remember the OKC bombing and the 1993 WTC bombing, and those didn't even surround a major international annual event. The Boston Marathon bombing will be remembered for decades.

Not even close to the scale of the remembrance of 9/11, not even remotely close. Most if not all terrorist incidents led to little or no major changes in US policy or law or culture. While on the other hand, 9/11 completely changed all of aforementioned.

Comparing the Boston Marathon Bombing to 9/11 is ridiculous because of the difference in scale. And the boston bombing will be remembered as a footnote, I doubt it gets a sentence in history textbooks, 9/11 on the other hand is the kind of event that gets a page dedicated to it.",2,0,1442875331,1444725904
