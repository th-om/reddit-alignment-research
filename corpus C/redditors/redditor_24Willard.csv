cvwtfo7,0,t1_cvwt4mm,24Willard,"Yea we've pretty much established that the early states are major indicators on future success. It's disingenuous to compare candidates without debates on the issues especially when looking at how much money each candidate has, where it comes from, and respective name recognition. 
To me it doesn't make a whole lot of sense that a candidate that is for what most people want whether it's single-player, less burdensome education, improved mental health, higher wages, against Tpp, against patriot act and for equality among all groups, isn't at a least closer match up. Especially when people are almost unanimously against money in politics, to which bernie isn't backed by corporations and is for overturning citizens united. And not to mention the fact he has been consistent in his views, another factor that people are pretty unanimously for, politicians you can point to that aren't liars. 
Therefore, it seems pretty clear with all these factors considered that the more people that actually hear what he is about, not just the media rhetoric, the more people will be for him. Don't forget, he's made fantastic progress in a very short amount of time. ",15,0,1444650093,1444728206
