She then graduated from Yale Law, and had a successful career as a lawyer and political adviser before becoming first lady. And while she wasn't born into difficulty, she doesn't come from a famous family, either.

You act like she's some frumpy housewife who rode her husband's coattails to fame. She probably accomplished more and worked harder before 1992 than you or I will in our lives.

> She's the frontrunner that is clearly not suppressed.

So her success is evidence that she has never been held back for being a woman?

She's been a woman for nearly 70 years. When she got married, coverture laws were still on the books and the marital rape exemption existed. She grew up in a culture that said that women aren't as capable or deserving as men. And *still* lives in an America whose politics are dominated by men, and which has never seen a female president.

It isn't surprising that these sorts of doors are more likely to be broken down by people who started with more advantages. But the fact that Clinton doesn't have a rags-to-riches story doesn't mean that her presidency wouldn't be historical for demonstrating that a woman can be elected to the highest office.",1,0,1444671494,1444717580

> Assembling your nerd hero: creating a safe space for students in your school.

> Making the impossible possible - authors of science fiction and fantasy

#

> Asian American comics and creators.

#

> Geek - constructing fandoms

Then I see three that reference identities (black, LGBT, woman). I didn't list them because it would be even more of a stretch than some of the ones I did list to think that identity politics would be central.

So let's be super generous to WiA and call that 8. Did I include your seven? What did I miss? What did I add?",1,0,1444599217,1444717580
cvw7x85,0,t1_cvw11tg,suto,"You seem to have missed the whole ""cultural context"" thing.

Women and black Americans have long been barred from positions of power, whether by explicit law or prejudice. It *is* significant that Obama is the first non-white president because it shows that whiteness is not a requirement for the country's highest office.

Similarly, the election of Hillary would show that maleness is not a requirement for that office.

Just swapping genders doesn't work. ""I think it would be great if Hillary were to be elected because then she would be the first woman among 44 people to be president"" can't be equated to, ""I think it would be great if Bernie were to be elected because then he would be the 44th man among 44 people to be president."" The former advocates inclusiveness, the latter exclusiveness.

In addition, as /u/JJWhatWhat already said and you seem to have ignored, it seems unlikely that ""single-issue voting"" is really the issue here. Ben Carson doesn't poll significantly better than other Republicans among black voters; they're still more likely to support a white candidate (Clinton). Similarly, there seems little reason to believe a woman who would gives Fiorina extra weight over Bush because of her sex would extend the same courtesy to Clinton.",-2,0,1444598371,1444717580
