cvxwuno,0,t1_cvwuanx,BlueJoshi,"It's not the same as Ura Zelda had during development, no. And Wind Waker probably isn't anything like what the original idea for the game was, either. The same is true of basically all games. But it doesn't mean that the games as represented at the beginning of their development ""didn't come out"". They just changed. Like how Ura Zelda changed during development and was eventually released as the Master Quest.",1,0,1444719476,1444722066
cvxwstd,0,t1_cvxaf9f,BlueJoshi,"> OoT with polished graphics previously unachievable by the N64 hardware

nnnno, it has the same graphics as OoT. Like, it straight up uses the same textures and models and both games run on the GameCube through an N64 emulator and are just ROMs.",1,0,1444719298,1444722066
cvxwqko,0,t1_cvwwlk8,BlueJoshi,"Yeah, Master Quest is what Ura Zelda ultimately became. Like not even ""some of the stuff was used for it,"" they finished the project and released it as the Master Quest.

Additionally, some of the content that was stripped out during development (most obviously the expanded mask stuff) made it into Majora's Mask.",1,0,1444719074,1444722066
cvxwaj7,0,t1_cvxrvps,BlueJoshi,"> all this talk about the NX

There is no talk about the NX. Nintendo has said literally nothing about it besides ""btw this will exist in the future"".",1,1,1444717586,1444722066

cvxw8ed,0,t1_cvxtsgd,BlueJoshi,"It wasn't even a minor design issue. They did it because they assumed most players would feel weird swinging the Wiimote around in their right hand while Link swings his left arm around, but as someone who holds the Wiimote in his left hand (Because I am a lefty, *like Link is supposed to be*), it didn't actually cause any issues and the whole thing was friggin' stupid.

Now, Skyward Sword? That game could have used the ability to swap what hand Link uses. I'd have been okay with it mirroring the entire world, too.",1,1,1444717392,1444722066
cvxw5gk,0,t1_cvxs9j0,BlueJoshi,"Just a new hardcover edition of the first bookâ€¦ except it also includes a ""new"" story, *Life and Death*, about young Beaufort Swan's encounter with the alluring Edythe Cullen.

Yeah, it's just Twilight again but with the genders swapped.",1,1,1444717132,1444722066
cvxjjvb,0,t1_cvxa1yr,BlueJoshi,"Twilight's tenth anniversary is this year and, yeah, they are cashing in.",1,1,1444694009,1444722066
