Your problem is that American law allows her to store her email on a private server, different issue. Since the law allows her as sos to have a private server for her email, there is nothing to jail her on. Brush up on your law. ",-1,0,1444704730,1444729185

cvxiiym,1,t3_3oic27,hot4you11,"When Hilary Clinton became secretary of state, she had the option of having two separate e-mails, one for personal and one for work, or setting up a private server and having all of her e-mail come to one place, which is easier because you only have one place to check. Both are legitimate options. She chose a private server. People are trying to say that this was illegal because it mixed work and private e-mail. It was not. Also, people are trying to say she e-mailed about topics which were classified. This would have been illegal because you can't send e-mails with classified information because you don't know who will intercept it. There is no evidence that she has sent any classified information in e-mail. It does appear that the information sent may have been classified AFTER she sent the e-mail but that is not illegal because she couldn't have know that it would later become classified.",-8,0,1444692340,1444729185
