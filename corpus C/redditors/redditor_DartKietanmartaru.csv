cvlog4c,0,t1_cvlntbw,DartKietanmartaru,"Because across 8.8 billion Earth-like planets, with 12-14 billion years to play with it is more likely than not that other tool-users have existed. 

That doesn't even count the possibility that non-earth-like planets could sustain life, which we can't rule out with a sample size of 1.",2,0,1443795812,1444721202
cvloe5x,0,t1_cvlncee,DartKietanmartaru,"You're right, it does only apply to our galaxy. But with 8.8 billion Earth-like planets there should have been at least one other life producing planet in the span of 12-14 billion years. 

Additionally as I said we do not know that earth-like conditions are a requirement for life, we just know we've only seen life on an earth-like planet.",1,0,1443795721,1444721202
cvlo989,0,t1_cvlm954,DartKietanmartaru,"That's true we don't know that. But we do know there are 8.8 billion earth-like planets in the universe alone. Even if the chance was miniscule the number of planets in the universe makes it likely life would form SOMEWHERE.

cvln6lp,0,t1_cvlmhuj,DartKietanmartaru,"We do know, however, that there are 8.8 Billion Earth-like planets in the milky way galaxy alone. 

It may be that there are other circumstances that cause life, but if those circumstances exist here on Earth, or existed, then it's not very likely they don't exist SOMEWHERE else in the universe, let alone on the 8.8 billion planets like earth in our galaxy. 

And that's the other thing, we don't know if it takes more than a sun and an earth-like planet. But we also don't know if it takes less. For all we know we could find life on Mars in the next 10 years. The things we don't know go both ways.

Edit: With that said, I don't think that the Fermi Paradox means that there is no life out there. But just because I think there is life out there currently doesn't mean that they numbers don't indicate life should ddevelop SOMEWHERE else.",2,0,1443793583,1444721202

cvljpwo,0,t1_cvldg13,DartKietanmartaru,"I think the only reason why people push for a Federal raise is because some states are much less likely to take it into consideration.

In a perfect world I agree the states should be setting this, but I think the reason why people are pushing for it federally is because they have little hope of seeing anything on the state level.",2,0,1443784847,1444721202
