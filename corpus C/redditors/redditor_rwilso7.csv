cvxbzel,1,t3_3ohung,rwilso7,"Carson can't be taken  seriously, but the PC police do in fact exist. Read sites  like the Daily Beast, Slate and Salon and you see them in their raw nature. Their view on anything is instantly predictable, and just like a right-wing parody of liberalism: Everything is America's fault, white people ( white men) are scum, and Islam is a tender bunny that needs protection. They make weak attempts to appear to care about income inequality, but their heart isn't in it.What they demand is Culture War, all the time.

But here's my prediction: you guys go 12-4, 13-3 and get a first round bye ( sorry but you ain't beating the Pats) and then get that sweet home game... and lose. Mr. Chicken Parm even when young was dicey in the playoffs, and He ain't young no more. Wanna bet?
