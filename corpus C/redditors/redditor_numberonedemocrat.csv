cvku3vt,0,t1_cvkrv80,numberonedemocrat,With a folder I usually open the knife part way and then slip the tie between the handle and the blade and squeeze it closed.  Probably not great for the knife but you won't cut your goober off (as my grandpa used to say).  Actually... I have cut myself a lot... so don't listen to me.  I would've been be too cheap to go to the ER for that one.,2,0,1443727268,1444722831

cvgyqyr,1,t3_3mp3d7,numberonedemocrat,If you had a workers comp claim in my state- you would be covered as an employee.  I don't know about the federal standards.  Companies try this sort of thing all the time and then attempt to get out of WC claims.  It never works- but this is not in FL.,1,0,1443455082,1444722831

cvcvnsp,0,t1_cvct9e9,numberonedemocrat,I would kill the turkey while she is watching... with the kids screaming and while laughing maniacally... but that is just kind of my style.  Don't do that- might give the old lady a heart attack.  I'd do it- but I am an idiot.,1,0,1443121414,1444722831
cvcul48,1,t3_3m7te4,numberonedemocrat,You can do it.  It may not be the most perfect rod but you won't screw it up so much that you won't enjoy fishing with it.  Just make sure the epoxy is mixed well and the guide spacing is right.  Also make sure it is all line up well.  Its not going to save a ton of money- but it is a lot of fun.,2,0,1443119827,1444722831
