cvwuauh,0,t1_cvvibck,ladut,"I was never in the Navy, but the Army? Yes. I'm pretty sure the EO programs between the two are very similar if not the same, so I've probably seen/experienced most of that crap.

I will say though that in my 7 years, I never saw a sexual harassment/assault investigation that appeared to be false. If anything, I hear about people being sexually assaulted far more often than I see it being reported. I've also never seen a female pass or get signed off for something she didn't earn in my unit (though we are a medical unit, so they take qualifications and training pretty seriously). I do understand that the cultural climate probably differs significantly between the units I've been in, and a crew of navymen stuck on a boat for months at a time, so I don't doubt it when you say your military experience has been much different.

As far as your sexual assault goes? That's a fucking issue I would stand behind 100% Those are the issues I thought I'd see more of in MRM, and issues that I think have the best chance of gaining traction with the general public. Thank you for talking about it, and I'm sorry the military fought you so hard about it. 

The reason I don't think this poster was an issue by itself is for the same reason I have no issue with nurses trying to encourage men to become nurses themselves. The medical industry has decided that more male nurses would be beneficial to the nursing field. That by itself is innocent. I don't know the reasons the Navy is encouraging female sailors to join. Maybe it's to improve public image and to become more ""inclusive."" That's not inherently a bad thing unless they get special treatment; but then the special treatment should be criticized, not the initiative.",1,0,1444652929,1444729577

cvvbtqp,0,t1_cvuzgu2,ladut,"I'm gonna be honest, I didn't get that at all. I think it's to encourage reenlistment among females because they are in the minority and the Navy wants to equal out the ranks. I don't see an issue in that at all.

The more I look at it, the more confused I become as to why you're offended, and why this belongs here at all. There are plenty of legitimate things to take issue with, legitimate examples of inequality or sexism; so I don't know why you'd choose to make a point about this. Doing so only makes the MRM look like tumblrinas trying to find things to be offended about. That's not a good thing.",7,0,1444524412,1444729577
cv3v7se,0,t1_cv3r9w0,ladut,"I've found that dealing with the baggage is worth what is gained in terms of a partner who is more capable of handling the challenges of a relationship in a healthy manner. That depends, of course, on the baggage. If the previous relationship resulted in the other person being more clingy, severely insecure, or still longing for their ex then it can cause real problems. But if they have small quirks, small insecurities, and a soft spot in their heart for what they had in the past, I'm OK with that. 

>If anything it'll be just hangups and more hangups.

There will always be hangups in a relationship, whether you marry a virgin or a person with experience. In fact, unless you've been in a relationship with both, I'd say it's naive of you to assume that the latter will cause more issues. There's a reason that in, say the US, most people don't marry their first partner. It's not because we're all deviants who don't respect the sanctity of a relationship; it's because at 18 and in your first relationship you are still learning so much about yourself and changing that oftentimes the issues that result from that are too much for the relationship.",6,0,1442433388,1444729577

cv0lj0b,0,t1_cv0hjep,ladut,"the other guy's argument is a common one in sociology. Even if you disagree, it's kind of surprising that you know as much as you appear to about the issue and haven't even heard of that concept.

 Income inequality well known to exacerbate racial issues. That doesn't mean that it will solve them, but just by increasing the SES and education levels of minority groups, you would expect to see a noticeable decline in racial inequality.
