Maybe if you didn't start your question in such a condescending, dismissive manner I'd be more willing to share my opinions with you.
""Would you care to name one? Literally any other meaningful thing he has accomplished in the last 30 years? 

Because I can produce an entire fucking laundry list for Hillary Clinton""
""Care to point at something Sanders has done? Because as far as I am aware, the only remotely distinguishable achievement in hiw entire career was the 2014 VA Bill""

But you had to be a patronising dick from the get go. And then go on to call me a patronising dick. And you expect me to want to share my opinions with you after that nonsense? Especially after seeing your avid support of the original post in this thread which was full of obnoxious, childish rhetoric posted by someone who can't even respond to any replies at all.

cvxns8x,1,t3_3oiw2c,SA311,I've noticed much more unreasonable disdain and vitriol in this subreddit towards sanders from Clinton supporters. To the point where people are claiming Sanders has accomplished nothing throughout his 35 years as a statesman. ,1,1,1444700599,1444717182
