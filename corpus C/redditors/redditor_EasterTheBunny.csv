cvtuir6,1,t3_3o3phg,EasterTheBunny,"A 4"" square steel post 1/4"" thick. Bury the post 4-6 ft deep in an 18"" diameter hole. Fill the hole with concrete.

A post like this will cause a lot of damage if hit by any vehicle. You may lose the mailbox, but you're likely to catch the culprit.

If you have problems with baseball bats or the like targeting the actual mailbox, you can employ a few solutions. I have seen a mailbox within a mailbox with concrete filling the gap. There are some rural type mailboxes on the market made of 12 gage or better cold rolled steel. There are even some pricey stainless steel ones available that are highly resistant to damage.

cvnqpzy,0,t1_cvnpimo,EasterTheBunny,"The point is that scale is exactly the problem. To call something in engineering scalable is short sighted. Everything scales fine to a point. What's in question isn't so much as feasibility of the mechanics involved. It's the scale of the proposed solution. You can build a giant wind farm involving large swaths of land with, in effect, a hydroelectric power station close by with a synthetic water system (as in not river fed) for a hefty investment.

The same thing could be accomplished wth a small number of nuclear power plants.

Just because one person doesn't know their dam trivia doesn't discredit the claim that wind power coupled with pumped hydroelectric isn't a viable option at the scale of larger output energy production. ",1,0,1443966310,1444728146

cvnbhwe,0,t1_cvnatlh,EasterTheBunny,"So basically a lake 100m under another lake with a set of turbines in between and pumps large enough to move significant amounts of water between the two.

So about these pumps...
The space shuttle had some pretty big fuel pumps. They claim to be able to drain an average family swimming pool in 25 seconds. Considering the average swimming pool to be about 25,000 gallons which might be on the low side, but it makes for easier maths. That's 1000 gal/s at 170,000,000 gal to move would equate to 1,970 space shuttle size pumps to move that same water back up over the time of a day speaking in volume alone.

Of course that negates head pressures at the pumps and assumes they could maintain that volume at that pressure. ",1,0,1443920561,1444728146
cvnar07,0,t1_cvn9y6p,EasterTheBunny,"So what you're saying is that if pumped hydro storage was used as a direct replacement for a wind grid for whatever reason of downtime, and that same grid serviced a modest 5 million people, the amount of water to drop that day would equate to approximately 255,000 Olympic sized swimming pools.

Do I have that right? I'm on my phone and applying some lazy calculations. ",1,0,1443919108,1444728146

cvn7tc9,1,t3_3ne45x,EasterTheBunny,"So if we started heavily taxing companies for deaths and health issues related to energy production, nuclear and renewables could compete in price? Do you think the public could swallow that reasoning?",10,0,1443913470,1444728146
