A large portion of the market (laptops) already support bluetooth. Hell, MS makes some. This thing should be a bluetooth adapter and nothing else.",1,0,1444699731,1444716713

Speak for yourself. 

>If killing fetuses is not murder, then killing latin american immigrant fetuses is not murder. Killing latin american fetuses would reduce crime, therefore it is moral.

You're missing the point. Telling a women what to do with her body is not moral. No government should have that power, and it's creepy that you think a government should be able to force a woman to carry a fetus to term.",0,0,1444693240,1444716713

cvxbfi5,0,t1_cvxapw5,bergamaut,"I'm just highlighting that it's not a personal issue that only affects the mother. Many anti-abortion activists think they can just force a fetus to be born and then not worry about the consequences. Society has seen a sharp decline in crime since abortion was made safe and legal.
