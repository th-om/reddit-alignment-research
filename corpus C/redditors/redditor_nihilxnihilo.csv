cvwl8q5,1,t3_3odq7s,nihilxnihilo,"> hiring a private mercenary army and take over a country of a wartorn part of the world, most likely in Africa somewhere

lol...so let's kill or deport millions of indigenous Africans. For science!

I think you are underestimating how chaotic this would be. People aren't going to just get up and leave their home because you give them a few dollars -- where do they go anyway? You would probably have a massive refugee crisis, and African resistance fighters waging war on the science people.",10,0,1444622148,1444723854

Steve Scalise was accused of speaking at a white supremacist conference, and yet was still appointed to be part of the leadership team. And McCarthy is going to remain Majority Leader.

Instead it seems like there must be something going on here behind the scenes. Maybe the ultra-conservative faction of the GOP has managed to gain some kind of power over the leadership and forced him to step aside.",1,0,1444330007,1444723854
cvrv0iw,0,t1_cvruer8,nihilxnihilo,">However, I do genuinely believe that the primary goal is to keep ISIS from getting too big and let the people of the region deal with it thenselves.

It would be incredibly naive to think that the primary goal of all powers involved is not geopolitics. Overthrowing Assad and installing a puppet government has been a long-term goal of Israel and the U.S. To the extent that ISIS is helpful towards this goal, it's not crazy to think that the U.S.-led bloc will lend them support, even if it's done through funding via Gulf countries. If the U.S. wanted to shut that funding down there is little doubt they could do so.",2,0,1444259299,1444723854
cvrts9h,0,t1_cvrtjvr,nihilxnihilo,"> That's taking the position that everybody has something of value to say in the conversation and that there's a learning opportunity that can happen from every single point of view. 

Doesn't sound so horrible to me. A learning opportunity can happen when you actually consider what motivates people instead of making them into cartoon villains.

I find that your typical modern left-winger has a very arbitrary view of what should be celebrated and what should be condemned, and usually they haven't put much thought into it. So people in a ""traditional culture"" somewhere else in the world would be celebrated and their religion and local culture protected. At the very least, there would be some level of understanding of why they might not accept radical social change. But the equivalent of traditionalists in America will be branded as literally worse than Hitler.",-22,0,1444257196,1444723854
cvrtaq3,1,t3_3nuyrs,nihilxnihilo,"""Military"" will be the popular answer but the reality is that welfare programs (which make up the vast majority of gov. spending) are probably extremely wasteful in terms of the benefits you actually get out of them. 

All that money paid into Social Security and Medicare gets a very poor rate of return compared with what you would get if you invested the same amount of money over a similar time period. So in terms of the meta picture of money not being used for the most productive purposes, an argument can be made that welfare programs are the most wasteful by far.",-1,0,1444256381,1444723854
