Honestly, I trust a corrupt politician to do the right thing more often than a politician that sincerely believes he knows what's best for the country. 

It's just that she sucks at being a politician. I doubt that Clinton is the most corrupt politician, but she lacks the skill to fix her public image. I mean, freaking JFK fucked M. Monroe and a slew of other women while he was still married to his wife and he's a goddamn hero! Gingrich has a couple of affairs and divorces and he's a villain. For fuck's sake. I want my politicians to be fucking clever.  ",1,1,1444704280,1444716355

>Clinton helped restore America’s leadership and standing in the world during a time of global challenges and changes.

Lybia, ISIS, Ukraine, Bengazi, Russia, Syria.

>She built and maintained a coalition to enact the toughest sanctions in Iran’s history.

""Tough Sanctions"" is just bullshit rhetoric as well as brute economic warfare. It's just cutting off the air supply to a country. The people suffer the most (do you think top government officials were honestly hurt? Maybe they lost money, but their king sized mattresses are still fine). I want our Secretary of State that can handle foreign policy with a fine brush. The nuclear deal with Iran, though I am opposed to it, is leagues ahead of sanctions in terms of nuance and sophistication. 

>Played an integral role in the New START Treaty with Russia.

Like Russia respects American leadership right now.

>Supported the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice.

Support? Not much credit goes to supporting something, especially if it was going to happen anyway. I support taking down assholes. Should I get credit for taking out Osama, too?


> Helped avert war in Gaza by negotiating a ceasefire between Israelis and Palestinians.

Putting duct tape to keep a piece of shit together, just like everybody else did, doesn't get you points in my book.



>She worked to build the coalition to oust Qadhafi and stop massacres in Libya.

I'm not pro-bush administration, but thanks to him, he became an ally and surrendered his wmd (probably for some incentive) in order to supply us with support and intel in the middle east. Same goes for Mubarak. Our Foreign Policy in the Middle East shows our allies that our support is factitious. The whole Arab Spring ended up replacing secular but friendly assholes with religious and unfriendly assholes. Russia wouldn't be such a power player in the Middle East right now if we had our allies' backs.



>Brought the State Department into the 21st Century. 

The fuck does that mean? They all got Macs now or some shit? Human nature doesn't change, just the people in power. You can read Machiavelli and Hobbes get a shit ton of meaningful advice on foreign policy and Clinton, like her predecessors, keep violating it and getting is into further shit overseas.

 >Secretary Clinton elevated the cause of women’s rights to new heights.

Throw this into the ""the fuck?"" pile. This is just more rhetoric. New heights? What's changed? More news time on female issues? ",1,1,1444704025,1444716355

Two things: Why give all of them public money when there is a chance that none the of them will win? Seems incredibly wasteful. Also, why should ""my"" money go to Santorum if I don't want to give him a dime.


Also also, if we get publicly funded elections, I'm running for everything. I'm using The free money to run the laziest campaign from my living room.

cvvzcma,0,t1_cvvu4yy,rAlexanderAcosta,"> bring back jobs that pay a living wage.

I agree with you on the over criminalization part, but I would disagree with you depending on how you mean this.

The only force capable of bringing high wage jobs is higher demand for particular form of labor. 

Mandated higher wages only helps those who are worth the new wage, often hurting young people and minorities the most because they lack the skills or education to be worth the price. The only way all workers benefit from an increase in wages is if  they can't be replaced (which is hard when we have lots of illegals and automation) and they generate more value than the new wage

In addition, the only thing tax cuts guarantee is that employers get to keep more of their own money. Tax cuts in the name of job growth aren't valid unless there is more demand in the market for an employers product or service than the employer is able to supply.

In short, be weary of both propositions.
