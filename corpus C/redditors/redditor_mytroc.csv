I hope you'll also recognize that I'm an actual person who has thought quite rationally about their beliefs and has come to the same conclusions as you on many topics.  

This person who generally has a similar outlook to your own, disagrees with you quite fundamentally on this specific issue.

Rather than continuing to dismiss me as irrational and insane, you should ponder why someone who is otherwise extremely rational *appears to you* to be completely irrational on this *one* topic. 

It's possible that I *am* simply behaving irrationally on this one issue, but it's also possible that you've missed a significant piece of the puzzle and are rationalizing without understanding all the facts. ",7,0,1444412473,1444725433

Many gamers are women, to the point where it's almost as if there's no significant difference between the average brain functions of men and women. 

Since you cannot accept all the polling and scientific studies that indicate this, I thought a humorous anecdote might help you out.  ",4,0,1444411959,1444725433

No, the fact that he confronted her in a situation where she could not leave is unfortunate and socially awkward.

His behavior was unfortunate and ill-advised, and he should learn how better to interact with other humans. That's not saying that he is ""a harasser,"" those are your words.",3,0,1444411027,1444725433

Exactly! In my real-world circle of friends it's closer to 80% of the gamers are women.
