cvscn6l,1,t3_3nyihy,Pastreu,"Late summer (here in central Europe).

It's still warm enough to just wear a T-Shirt and you can just put on an open hoodie/cardigan in the evening. It's still light till the late evening, however it's not burning hot during the mid day. Good season for pretty much every outdoor or indoor activity that doesn't require snow.",2,0,1444302709,1444726074
cvscfml,0,t1_cvrrxnj,Pastreu,"I agree with a lot you say. I have the feeling that a lot of players don't vote if they think a specialization is a decent sidegrade, they vote for those specs that are straight upgrades. Reaper and Chronomancer being the obvious choices as they provide a lot of additional damage and/or utility compared to their ""base"" class. Specs that actually work decently as a mere sidegrade (like Berserker, Daredevil, and - even if there still is room for improvement - Tempest) merely get a ""meh"" reaction.

This is quite sad, and I hope this will not make Anet blindly buff stuff so everyone can feel super powerful with their new shiny pseudo-class.

I really miss the days of GW1 where there would be a balance pass every 1-2 weeks, with skills being adjusted (and sometimes completely changed) to bring them more in line with others. Sure, I'm looking forward to playing Reaper a lot - but what would make me really happy would be a balance pass that makes the other trait lines perform on par with the Reaper spec, so it's actually a choice. People might complain about how ""boring"" the Berserker is compared to other specializations, but at least here I got the feeling that it's a real sidegrade to the other Warrior trait lines.",1,0,1444301942,1444726074
cvox4e3,0,t1_cvowkjb,Pastreu,"My guess: Licensing fees. Lots and lots of licensing fees.

Also I can completely appreciate the official trailers, and their decision to go with their own score. There is an artistic cohesion to it that I can admire. And when it also works as a great source for a ""remix"" like the one I linked, everybody wins :)",17,0,1444055150,1444726074

On the plus side, the text at the end of your video reminded me I had to block my vacation days for HoT release before it's to late, so thanks for that!",75,0,1444042436,1444726074

I'm not criticizing this mans actions, I simply suspect (and criticize) that once media attention has gone away he'll be stuck with tons of medical bills, etc. as has happend with a lot of ""heroes"".",1,0,1443794017,1444726074
cvlhqlb,0,t1_cvlfb0d,Pastreu,"People will be standing in line to shake hands and buy him a beer. High-profile people that is, looking for a nice photo op with an American Hero. There will be tv interviews, award ceremonies, gifts, etc. ...

And then, 8 months from now, almost nobody will even remember his name. The best you can hope is that the current media attention will help to make sure the medical bills will be covered. Call me a cynic, but do you remember any names of ""heroes"" that were on TV lately? The guy that jumped in front of a NY subway to save a child, for example? And just think about what a huge media shitstorm there had to build up against the 9/11 First Responders Health bill filibuster...",824,0,1443776319,1444726074
