cvwcroz,0,t1_cvwak91,Zephyr256k,"What do you mean by 'intensive background checks on friends and family'. Even a simple background check is pretty difficult considering the lack of communication amongst municipal, state and federal agencies regarding even basic disqualifying factors for the current NICS system. Expanding that to 'friends and family' would be a farce. What even constitutes 'friends and family' for these purposes anyway? What if my uncle who lives on the other side of the country has a history of domestic abuse? What if my high-school friend who I never see anymore has a drug conviction for an ounce of weed? What if my roommate is a multiple-conviction armed bank robber but I promise to keep my gun locked up in a safe? 

And what's the rational for raising the minimum age to 28-30? In many states, students can't even keep a firearm int heir car of dorm-room, there's not a whole lot of distance between those restrictions and just not being to own a firearm at all while your in school. But those states don't seem to have measurably fewer mass shootings or other on-campus crimes than states that do allow students to keep or even carry firearms on campus.

cvwcbzk,1,t3_3odco2,Zephyr256k,">Imagine if Cho had walked into the class, not with a gun, but with maybe a knife.

Wouldn't have happened that way. Knife attacks actually happen in the U.S. and in parts of the world where firearms are significantly harder to obtain, so you don't have to treat this as some kind of nebulous hypothetical.  
Looking at the dynamics of actual knife attacks, they tend to look much different from firearm attacks. Instead of stalking from classroom to classroom, a knife attacker is more likely to choose a crowded event or packed hallway between classes. Somewhere victims and bystanders are going to have a hard time escaping against the press of people and tight quarters.

> ""well, you take away the gun, the killer will just find another way to kill people"". Yes, he will and there is nothing we can do about it.

There absolutely is.
We can reduce the motives for such attacks by changing how they're covered in the media. localize the story, focus on the victims and the effects on the community rather than the perpetrators and their motives. Make it clear such attacks are pointless.    
The vast majority of massacres end when the attacker is confronted by strong resistance. Equipping students, staff and other civilians with the tools and training to protect and care for themselves and those around them is probably the single most effective thing we can do to reduce the casualty count in the event an attack does take place.  
That doesn't necessarily mean arming them with firearms of their own as even unarmed resistance can be effective against such attacks.  
Finally, We can make the environment less conducive over-all to violence with a strong social safety-net, ending the war on drugs, implementing treatment programs for addiction, ending the private prison-industrial complex, further improving access to healthcare, etc. Most firearm violence isn't mass shootings, it's gang-related and tied directly to the drug war, prison-industrial complex and the conditions of socio-economic despair in the inner cities.  
Beside the media influence, there's not a whole lot we know about the causes of massacres specifically. It's a difficult problem to study as it's so rare and the perpetrators tend to kill themselves making any diagnosis of their mental state and other factors that might contribute basically impossible. We should definitely make more of an effort to study the problem.",7,0,1444605841,1444720352
