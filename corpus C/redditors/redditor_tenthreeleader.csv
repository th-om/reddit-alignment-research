Star Trek has money and people like Cyrano Jones and to a lesser extent, Harry Mudd wanted as much of it as possible.

Which is why people are talking about third party candidacies.  From both sides, the lesser of two evils is still evil, and people are finally starting to see that.

If Trump is the Republican nominee I'll go third party in a heartbeat.  And I know I'm not alone among movement conservatives in saying so.",1,0,1444573340,1444719917
