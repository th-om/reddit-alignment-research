cvmvexw,0,t1_cvmse6v,ccnofeednog,"While I agree with this advice here, I think it's probably unhealthy think of your ex as a bitch/asshole just because you're no longer together -- it's easy to convince yourself that your ex is the worst person ever because that makes it easier to cope w/ not being with him/her anymore. but that's really just putting a bandaid on the wound by pretending you didn't enjoy that person's company for years. You don't have to be BFFs with your ex, but you also don't have to hate their guts. There's a healthy middle ground where you can find some kind of peace.",26,0,1443891473,1444724608

But assuming you're right: wouldn't the fact that only younger female leads can return an investment be a symptom of patriarchy? Like, isn't that saying people only want to pay to see young sexy women?",2,0,1443302156,1444724608

I have no doubts that some people dislike her because of casual sexism, but please do not assume that that informs my decision. I find her to be less likable than other candidates in the same way that I did not like Mitt Romney in 2012. She has come across as aloof, impersonal, and calculating all summer. Her recent push to make herself more available and visible to the public can only help her because of that.",3,0,1443185819,1444724608
