cvo0zvk,0,t1_cvmk0g8,alecbenzer,"> You need to cite some historic examples of charity being adequate enough to fill the gaps needed to run a civilization.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by ""running a civilization"". Certainly caring for the homeless and others in need of help is compassionate, and while such compassion is important, I think civilization would still ""run"" without it.

But that's mostly beside the point.

I won't say I *know* that charity would be enough to care for the homeless, but I haven't heard much of a convincing argument for why it wouldn't be. And as I view the government's funding of social programs as a form of aggression, I expect more of a reason for why it *is* necessary than a reason it isn't.

""Things have always been done that way"" doesn't seem like a compelling argument to me. The implication is that things have always been done that way because it's the only way that works, but that's not necessarily true. Other solutions could work, and maybe even work better. State solutions to problems might be prevalent throughout history because people have always thought that certain problems ought to be solved by the state, due to ""momentum"" more than that the state is actually the right way to solve that problem.

And besides, I don't even know if ""things have always been that way"" is even true for social programs. Medieval Iceland, for example (which is often used as an example of much more voluntary than average society) had no official executive branch of government at all, let alone any kind of formal social programs. I wouldn't imagine it's the only example of such a society in all of human history (though I don't know, maybe it is, as it's unique in many other ways). Churches have also been largely run by voluntary donations and have acted as large social safety nets, but I don't know how often this was the case in the complete absence of any state programs.

> Maybe the state is a crutch because something is broken. I'd love to see civilization evolve into a stateless classless utopia through 100% voluntary means. But we're short of the viability of that goal.

I mean, yes, something is broken, but I'm saying it's better to focus on fixing a broken bone than giving people crutches for them, if the former is possible. Maybe the former isn't possible, maybe a voluntary society isn't viable. But I don't think I believe that.",1,0,1443983882,1444722225
cvmidkg,1,t3_3mnrps,alecbenzer,"I'd say:

1) Looking at charity in terms of what it is like today vs. what it might be like if there were no government social programs isn't necessarily a fair comparison. You can imagine that there's a certain public demand for care for the homeless. Some of it is filled by social programs. If the social programs weren't there, it's conceivable that charities would expand to take up the excess demand.

2) I think focusing on issues like this in general are focusing on crutches. What we really want is to reduce homelessness.",1,0,1443849262,1444722225

It's not at all clear who is supposed to be the kid and who is supposed to be the parent in this analogy.
