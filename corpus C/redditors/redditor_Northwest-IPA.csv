cvwdpt8,1,t3_3od8n7,Northwest-IPA,"I would challenge your idea of why Democrats or Republicans support anything. When a pundit on TV talks about a ""coalition of votors"" or a politician ""building a wining coalition"" they are discussing how politicians use divisive issues to gain more votors into their block. They will basically say anything to get votes, including change positions if necessary. To make themselves feel better, votors convince themselves that the contradictions of their favorite politicians are by design, not just a by-product of demographics. They connect the dots with statements like ""the only thing that government should excel at is military strength"" to explain to themselves why thier favorite anti-abortion candidate is also against school funding. Among the D&R establishment, there are no real beliefs, just wining and losing positions, campain contributions, and voting coalitions.

So my opinion is that the Republican politicians didn't intend on the votors being against the establishment, its just a side-effect of the bullshit that the politicians have been feeding their constituents to make them stay onboard with the voting block. I.e. the government taxes and regulations are bad, and Obama sucks eventually leads to the government sucks.",0,0,1444608448,1444719253

cvo11ee,0,t1_cvnkr45,Northwest-IPA,"Thanks for the detailed and well thought out response. You seem to have a more nuanced view of regulations than most people, which I appreciate. I know this is off topic now because nobody is asking, but I'm involved in helping ensure my companies product line is compliant with regulations, and the whole process is very complex and expensive, and has given me a similarly nuanced perspective. 

For my situation, in essence, the government scientists determine through environmental and health studies that airborn particulate matter, for example, need to be reduced because some thousands of lives are estimated be saved due to reduced respitory disease, for example. My knowledge of these studies and the individuals doing the studying gives me personally confidence that their process and conclusions are robust (given there is a disclosed +/- uncertainty), which is besides the point because thats just personal opinion. There's room for disagreement, and there is within the field on the specifics. The gov typically goes with the middle ground consensus of those involved, which again, doesn't make it perfect.

So, the government works with industry to determine cost-effective and feasible ways of reducing the harmful emmision. This is where it gets hairy, because the industry players would like to manufacture a product that is profitable, but there is also a competitive aspect where we could raise prices if our competition were not complaint and thus no longer competing in the market. So, various industry players solicit the regulators to tweak the regulation to give their company a technology or business advantage. For example, if my company has a patent on a certain filter that reduces emission X more than our competition, we will push the EPA to have stringent requirements on emission X that only we can meet. I shit you not. Or if my company is a supplier of material Al, I will push for the goverment to give credits to companies that replace material St with material Al. This actually is in a regulation applicable to my work.

Luckily, the goverment scientists are for the most part smart people and see through most of this bullshit, but its not thanks to us. Even so, bullshit will still get into the regulations because the government really does work closely with the industry, and everyone is pushing to give themselves a leg up and the government makes honest mistakes trusting untrustworthy individuals. From the governments perspective, people die from harmful emmisions and they want it fixed in a cost effective way. But when the industry players use the rule making process to engage in anti-trust behavior, the government can only filter out bullshit by hiring PhDs and technical experts this growing the size of this bureaucracy.

So, I'm not really trying to convince anyone of a certain solution, because I don't have one. Maybe if the government actually enforced anti-trust laws? I don't know.

I would also say that having many local emissions regulations versus a single federal regulation would increase the regulatory burden for small companies. It takes a lot of staff to service the product modularity necessary for supporting multiple emissions standards.

The whole topic is complicated. Our customers would prefer not to have to meet federal regulations, and they increase the cost of the product substantially, really they do. This is probably where the difference between supporting and not supporting the EPA, for example, comes from. The question being, should industry (and consumers in many cases) be FORCED to pay more for the externalities created by their consumption and/or business operations? 

That's also an economic question because certainly a $/life saved metric can be setup, and maybe most people would pay $0.01 extra for gas if it saved a life each time. But what about $1, or $100, or $1000? And how trustworthy is the process? Or might there be another way of meeting the intent of reducing unwanted externalities without strict caps? Or can the compliance process be optimized so that its not so burdensome? It's good stuff to think about.",1,0,1443983950,1444719253

As for why, I'm familiar with some arguments which vary depending on an individuals level of cynicism. 1)  humanist aspirations like spreading freedom, 2) keeping Americans safe, or 3) war is justified on the basis of economic benefits such as oil trade, military manufacturing jobs, or ensuring hegemony of the US dollar in world trade.

The country was purposely setup not using a directly democratic process, with the threat of the populace as a final check on government rule. This means that the citizens require access to weapons that are sufficiently deadly to act as a deterrent to our own military, considering asymmetric warfare (meaning we don't need stealth bombers, but probably do need assault weapons, or eliminate the standing army). However, I also believe that the preventing certain types of fellons and mentally unstable people from owning guns is fine, and that the reason this is an issue is becasue the NRA is an industry trade association who's purpose is to advocate for the gun manufacturer's.",1,0,1443925544,1444719253
