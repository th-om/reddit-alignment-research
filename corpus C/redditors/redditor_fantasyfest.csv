cvnypt3,1,t3_3nd3un,fantasyfest,  I am not convinced that smoking pot does not cause lung problems. Burning a weed and sucking it into your lungs is surely abusing them and your body. But the figures on smoking are horrendous. It is terribly addictive and dangerous for people. Harper is lying or stupid.....or being bought off.,2,0,1443980462,1444721392

cvny8e6,0,t1_cvnxspe,fantasyfest,  Observers make up things like S curves. Nuclear plant do not follow them. Alternative energy is the energy of the future and the present. You can install it and go off line totally. You can be sure energy companies are fighting it and trying to find a way to make money off it.,1,0,1443979739,1444721392
cvnvlos,0,t1_cvnui27,fantasyfest, Not even close. In the last few years solar and wind have replaced dozens of nuclear plants that could have been built. They would still be gobbling up money in construction and bribes. Just face it that nuclear energy's time is past.,0,0,1443975753,1444721392
cvnuvxu,0,t1_cvni24z,fantasyfest,"  Mormonism and Scientology are recent. we know what the assholes who started them were like. Those religious work overtime polishing those turds. They were terrible people and had no respect for humans. They just wanted money and power. The difference, is other religions have been scrubbing their warts away for a longer time. In a thousand years those religions will have the same spot in society that Christianity does. Maybe Flying Spaghetti Monster will too. It makes just as much sense.",1,0,1443974504,1444721392
cvnupa0,0,t1_cvnhnqe,fantasyfest,"  Nuke has been around for over 70 years. wind and solar are new and being installed more and more as we write. Nuke plants have a shelf life of 50 years which we have chosen to ignore. We just keep certifying them. They are accumulating enormous amounts of radioactive scrap and fuel rods which are sitting in swimming pools. That is a terrible way to manage that serious problem. They cost a decade and billions to build and billions more to mothball. They leave radioactive scar in valuable real estate since they require a lot of water, they are built on oceans or rivers. They have captured the press quite well though.",0,0,1443974195,1444721392
cvnuema,0,t1_cvnhmr3,fantasyfest, The storage of solar and wind is making great strides. That criticism is dated now and soon to be obsolete.It has faded even now.,0,0,1443973689,1444721392
