cvxlyf7,0,t1_cvwzj17,ull90,"Are you ignoring Carter's tirade on Peterson from last year? He didn't say ""oh, Peterson should have had a fall guy."" He got angry at him for hitting his kid. He was also in those ""No More"" commercials. I'm guessing his ""fall guy"" advice was for things that may happen with a lot more guys, like getting into fights at a club. Having a fall guy for domestic violence would be kind of difficult. ""Oh, yeah, it was my friend. He'll confess."" ",2,0,1444697822,1444726432
cvxl9qp,0,t1_cvxkyaj,ull90,"At about 6:40, he talks about the Center we traded for. I think he really didn't want to say ""Oh, Kendricks does so-and-so better than Hodges and Hodges lacked so-and-so."" I think he just thinks that Kendricks is still a rookie so he didn't want to give him too much praise and he didn't want to bash Hodges at all because, as he's said, he'll always fight for his players.",3,0,1444696766,1444726432
cvxkudx,0,t1_cvxkox9,ull90,"He was fine until they started asking about it. I don't think he was bummed or he would have been upset for all of the presser. He was just upset when they kept asking about the Hodges trade. I also really don't think Spielman would do that to Zimmer. They seem to work together well (I guess most of that is private, though, so I could be completely wrong). If Zimmer had really pounded the table for Hodges, I highly doubt he would have been traded.

cvxkkkm,1,t3_3oiblt,ull90,"You can always tell when he doesn't think he should speak his mind. Seems like this is one of those times. Can't tell what he really thinks, though. Either he really doesn't care about the trade and didn't want to throw Hodges under the bus or he didn't want Hodges to be traded. My guess is that he really doesn't care about the trade that much (business is business), anticipated the questions, and just didn't want to deal with it. He just wants to coach football.",6,0,1444695669,1444726432
cvxjamo,0,t1_cvxg77l,ull90,I saw the same thing. Either formation based or they switched his position thinking they could get better matchups that way. ,1,0,1444693607,1444726432
cvwo9s4,0,t1_cvwgmsw,ull90,"Second round is pushing it for this guy. I'd guess the third third, especially with the injury. He wasn't going in the first prior to the injury. He's overly aggressive, just like Sendejo and Exum. He hardly ever makes the safe play. 

The two 2015 videos on draftbreakdown show him against teams that can't compete with WVU: Georgia Southern and Maryland. In both, you can see his over-aggressiveness get the best if him. There's a run in the GS game where he comes downhill really fast but completely misses the tackle and allows the first down. In the Maryland game, there's a nice play where he comes downhill quickly again and gets a TFL. Two clips later, he does the same thing, but misses the tackle and allows the runner to get the first down. I really don't want that kind of play from a safety. I appreciate his physicality and the fact that he is aggressive. However, he's too aggressive for his own good and makes a lot of mistakes because of it. I'd be surprised if he went early in the second. I could see him falling into the third or later. ",1,0,1444629640,1444726432
cvwo0nk,0,t1_cvwmkuq,ull90,"In a 43, he'd likely be best as an OLB, but that's true for Kendricks as well and he's going to be playing Mike this year (though probably will not play Mike after this year). Jack is probably better suited to Mike than Kendricks, as well. They're approximately the same size, but Jack just seems to be better at taking on and shedding blockers. 

You don't have to tell me about all the things he is able to do because of his athleticism. I've been watching him since I started looking at Barr for the 2014 draft. He'll be a versatile LB in the nfl, but won't be moved to safety. Jack is probably more athletic than Thompson, but that doesn't mean people will think about moving him to safety. The argument for moving Thompson to safety is because he was an undersized linebacker and looked more like a lanky, big safety than a linebacker. He had also played safety in college before moving to linebacker. Jack hasn't played safety or CB. He's just a very versatile linebacker that they liked to use in different ways, including lining him up on slot receivers. He really could play any LB position in a 43. Making him play that Taylor Mays role would be a mistake. We would just put him at Mike or Will and have certain plays on which we'd feel comfortable putting him in the slot on a WR. In nickel, I'm guessing we might move Barr to DE or run a 3-3-5 package and blitz one or two of the linebackers. ",2,0,1444628891,1444726432
