cvu8cv2,0,t1_cvu7iaa,SomeAsianGuy00,"I think the thing is ur confusing the ROC and the PRC as 2 different countries.  The ROC and PRC are the same ""country"" but are different governments.  Taiwan itself has actually never declared independence from China.  So it is still part of China.  The PRC is the government that the majority of the world recognizes as China.  The PRC claim to the islands as ""China's"" which the ROC as well.  They just disagree which one of them is the real China.  ",3,0,1444430054,1444720869

Sounds like the school needs some new attorneys and a new legal department.  ",8,0,1444426943,1444720869
cvu5z20,1,t3_3o5blb,SomeAsianGuy00,The Laffer curve isn't absolute or even proven to be true.  Its part of a theory someone came up with.  I should mention that more liberal economist have poked a bunch of holes in it and the theory it supports.  Economics isn't a sure science.  If it was there wouldn't be any arguments about it.  ,1,0,1444425984,1444720869
cvu4ezk,0,t1_cvu46f5,SomeAsianGuy00,"If states lean blue that means the majority in those states will vote Democrat.  Which means they are more popular by whatever reason.  If republicans have fewer states at the start then either they are all bunched of in those states as a super majority, or the republicans are just less popular.  

Unless democrats are winning via the electoral college and losing the popular vote then its just a less people vote republican issue.  ",0,0,1444423520,1444720869

If a democrat won the presidency and lost the popular vote then yea that's the electoral college favoring them.  

It doesn't really matter how much you win by atm its just that you reach that you reach the magic number.  ",1,0,1444422613,1444720869

cvty2wh,0,t1_cvtxmbh,SomeAsianGuy00,"The police are there and they do a somewhat ok job as security.  They do also enforce the law.  Someone breaks into your place the cops are generally on it, though not always the fastest.

Yes roads are a major thing they do.  It isn't even close to reasonable to have private companys run roads.  You have access to roads which ur vehicle or company vehicle travels.  You also know for a fact theres a road to your destination as the government spends time building them for you.  

Even if you end up fighting a 10 year legal battle, you still have a method of enforcing said contract.  Without the courts if someone just decides to just not pay you or provide you with whatever you agreed to there is nothing you can fucking do.  You gonna say ""you said you would"" and they magically gonna do it?  Sure you can go try and take it by force but your still spending money.

You do realize UPS and Fedex pass off anything that isn't really profitable to the USPS.  It may not be free but IT SERVICES EVERYONE.  If you send something through the USPS and its somewhere in the US then the USPS has a office somewhere near it that can deliver that.  UPS and Fedex do not have a post that services everyone.  Its the same to ship to a major city and to the middle of the desert with the USPS.  

Unfair practices use to be a big problem.  Monopolies used to be formed because all the big companies would agree to do something.  Smaller businesses which could not afford to do so would be put out.  Without government action that still be going on now.  This action is needed or else a few will end up just dominating the market (which did happen) and smaller companies be gone.  ",6,0,1444413924,1444720869
cvtwssg,0,t1_cvtw15b,SomeAsianGuy00,"Do you know how much they actually provide for you?

1. Roads for travel the government maintains (though not always well) and constructs them for use.  Chances are they use them even if its just getting to work.
2. Security.  The government provides security and protection through the police.  
3. Emergency services.  Your business or parts of it on fire yea the government has the fire department there to help you.  
4. Contract enforcement.  The government helps you by enforcing contracts between you and other businesses or people.  
5. They also provide legal avenues to pursue people who have damaged or wronged your business by breaking contracts, deals or some other method.  
6. Postal service.  You need shit sent somewhere in the US yea the government does that for you and covers the entire US.  You think Fedex or UPS is gonna put a office in the middle of nowhere for you?  
7. Protection against unfair businesses practices.  Such as everyone agreeing to lower prices or agreeing to not compete in the same area as long as you don't.  

There is a ton of stuff that they actually do for you that people take for granted.  Think about how a business would run if the government actually did nothing for them.  How much shit could you actually get done.  ",10,0,1444412004,1444720869
cvtr9js,0,t1_cvtlehq,SomeAsianGuy00,Problem is you don't have to convince the average person to vote for you.  You have to convince 218 congressmen to vote for you.  Trump also doesn't have any positions in Congress to offer them to bribe them for their votes.  ,2,0,1444403716,1444720869
