cvx66l2,1,t3_3og8tn,nighthawk_md,"So they wanted payment in advance during gestation and before delivery?  And you thought no payment at all was going to be due until after the delivery?  These OB billings are weird; sometimes they want money ASAP, sometimes after delivery.  It may have been a honest mistake on their part; if you don't have the money now but have budgeted for it April-July you might want to explain that to them.

Edit: Medicine is ultimately a service industry.  If you think they are being shady, fire them and get another doctor/practice.  Be sure to settle up with them after you fire them.  *Be sure* that the doctor knows they are getting fired because of problems with the billing department.",0,0,1444673979,1444722746

cvvqmd5,1,t3_3obmrm,nighthawk_md,So you'd put a strap through the cutouts and you could attach something cylindrical (eg a bedroll) to your bag?  But wouldn't that make it vertically oriented?  Wouldn't a couple of them with horizontal cutouts be more useful then?,2,0,1444566334,1444722746
cvuzkna,0,t1_cvuu7gm,nighthawk_md,"One interpretation is that used her own server because she specifically didn't want her official State department email communications to become part of the public record.  

Her ""explanation"" that she didn't want to use two devices and two separate email accounts (one for work, and one for personal stuff) is fucking asinine.  And if it was technically impossible at the time such that her hypothetical ""official"" state dept Blackberry was locked down and did not allow other mailboxes to be setup (I have no idea if this is true or not), too bad, you suck it it up and deal with using two phones.

Regardless of whether she actually violated and laws or regulations which is her current talking point as I understand it, this whole situation demonstrates either realllly poor judgement (like ""why should we elect you president?"" bad) or malicious intent.",3,0,1444501581,1444722746
