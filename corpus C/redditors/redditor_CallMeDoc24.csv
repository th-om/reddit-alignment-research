It's not just global warming. Relying on unsustainable practices is only going to hurt us more in the event of large disasters.

Money cannot solve everything, and it's unfortunate people are so certain investing in a cause will do the trick.

> But the new irrigation systems have not helped conserve water supplies, studies show. And researchers believe that the new equipment may be speeding up the depletion of groundwater supplies, which are crucial to agriculture and as a source of drinking water. The program is getting renewed attention this week as the Senate works to complete a $955 billion, five-year farm bill.

> The meat industry also has a significant impact on global warming. Livestock production accounts for 18 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, including 9 percent of carbon dioxide and 37 percent of methane gas emissions worldwide, according to the Livestock, Environment and Development (LEAD) Initiative, an international consortium of government and private agencies based at FAO headquarters in Rome. 
More than two-thirds of all agricultural land is devoted to growing feed for livestock, while only 8 percent is used to grow food for direct human consumption, LEAD reported. If the entire world population were to consume as much meat as the Western world does-176 pounds of meat per capita per year- the global land required would be two-thirds more than what is presently used

------------------------------

> LEAD researchers also found that the global livestock industry uses dwindling supplies of freshwater, destroys forests and grasslands, and causes soil erosion, while pollution and the runoff of fertilizer and animal waste create dead zones in coastal areas and smother coral reefs. There also is concern over increased antibiotic resistance, since livestock accounts for 50 percent of antibiotic use globally, according to LEAD.

I simply see an unsustainable system where the impacts on our infrastructure and environment are known and severe in some regards, and unknown in others. It is by products that are not being taxed, but instead subsidized by us. But there are no major plans to tackle this issue simply because the consequences haven't impacted daily life hard enough yet. I guess my main problem is seeing with how this will implemented and enforced in the future when people overlook future needs with present-day luxuries. My other issue is: what's the point of only doing this once it's so bad that our taxes then will have a negligible effect? ",0,0,1444712462,1444718398

If you need to compensate for it elsewhere, it indicates that there's a problem. And taxing it appropriately is great and all, but what exactly is appropriate? Who defines that limit and how exactly will it be regulated?

There comes a point when taxing a commodity is simply insufficient. We haven't come across that point, yet, but we surely will. ",0,0,1444705494,1444718398

------------------------------------------

> Many authors have called for the elimination of irrigation subsidies, at times suggesting that water is a commodity and should be priced accordingly ... When demand is price inelastic, quantity demanded declines by a smaller proportion than an increase in price, such that revenues collected from water users increase substantially, with little change in the volume of irrigation water used.

-----------

> The issue of irrigation water pricing arises also in discussions of sustainability. If farmers pay only for the current costs of operating and maintaining a public irrigation facility, revenues will fall short of the amount needed to rehabilitate the system and invest in new features, over time. Sustainability might also require that water prices reflect the long-term implications of irrigation, such as the potential for developing waterlogged and saline areas, and the off-farm impacts of irrigation and drainage, such as the transport of sediment and pollutants into streams and lakes. Where farmers irrigate with groundwater, the private cost of pumping might not reflect the near-term impacts on other water users or the long-term impacts of maintaining withdrawals in excess of recharge. Groundwater fees and allocation policies might be needed to motivate farmers to reduce pumping rates to levels that ensure sustainability.

No, it's not. It's basically saying that when water reserves are low and unsustainable going forward, that we don't spend it frivolously based on our cravings today.
