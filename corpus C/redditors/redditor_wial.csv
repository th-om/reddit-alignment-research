Bernie of course is a whole lot more likely to have their backs once in office, but they need to hear that loud and clear and even more importantly, that he won't fail them in the election the way some other progressive candidates have in the past (cue Stevie Wonder's ""You Haven't Done Nothin'"" which was about Nixon's broken promises, after Humphrey/McGovern's failed campaigns saddled the world with his paranoid criminality).",6,0,1444683832,1444722459

Instead, the person said, an aide to Ms. Wasserman Schultz expressed a desire to keep the focus on the candidates as the debate approached, rather than on a “distraction” that could divide the party, and suggested that if Ms. Gabbard could not do that, she should reconsider going.

This is so sickeningly mealy-mouthed. Everything I hate about establishment politics and attitudes.  It's soulless and condescending, and why those characters need to be swept from office, replaced with progressives who are actually of the people, and have actual hearts.",2,0,1444667480,1444722459
cvu2yv1,0,t1_cvtxp2j,wial,"But Buddhism isn't either monkhood or nothing? And again, what you mean by ""regular life"" is not life as such, but a hindrance to direct experience of reality, our birthright.  It's like saying people who aren't addicted to heroin aren't living, because they're missing out on the rush -- and deep meditation can  be more blissful than anything else, even if that isn't the final goal and reward, which is even better.",1,0,1444421257,1444722459
cvtxjow,0,t1_cvtw2ef,wial,"""Life"". You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means.  Buddhism rejects what *hinders* appreciation of life.  It's confusing I know, and to be sure different Buddhist traditions weight the experience differently, but I highly doubt either of us have a fully accurate grasp of what it means to attain Buddhahood, and it takes decades of practice even to get a glimpse.

""Don't know mind"" is your friend!  Like Socrates, the Buddha, and Richard Feynman said!

Buddhism is the ancestor of science. In the Kalama Sutta the Buddha outlines the basis for the critical method, and that got transmitted to the Greek philosophers in Alexander's courts in India, who then took it back to invigorate their traditions of cynicism, stoicism, and skepticism.  Stoicism in particular was close to Buddhism as a natural philosophy and formed a major basis for the awakening of science in the Renaissance.  Sadly though, the methods of yogic verification still practiced in Buddhism Asia got lost along the way, and are only now being transmitted to the discipline of cognitive psychology by way of conferences with HH the Dalai Lama and other accomplished Buddhists.  There's no reason the scientific method can't be improved to cover internal experience, and that's happening now.

In short, it's fair to say Buddhism has a great deal of wealth to offer to the secular perspective, and is doing so -- also at the level of ethics, and again HH the Dalai Lama writes books on that very subject.",1,0,1444413126,1444722459
cvtvjjn,1,t3_3o1d2f,wial,"Stephen Batchelor writes well-researched books about a possible Buddhism beyond magical beliefs.  Personally, I'm willing to listen to a lot of the folklore and such because it provides frameworks for profound insights and we want to preserve and revitalize as much of the ancient wisdom as possible, but it's very unfortunate we have to welcome a corrupt patron-client system into our politically enlightened modernity to get that benefit.  

Many will dispute this, but the Buddha said we don't have to accept all of his teachings, and to me the best of them have to do with fine techniques of breathing meditation, the insight into the nature of things particularly the big breakthrough about their emptiness but also the further ones like suchness, and the deep emotions/actions of love, compassion, joy and equanimity that become possible once craving and self-grasping dissipate in the face of seeing and being pervaded by sublime natural reality.

I know a lot rides on whether metaphysical karma exists or not. I just don't see it in action, personally, and don't buy the examples the teachers give.  Wish I could!  I've known many people who remember past lives, was told of such just last night in fact, but until I see it for myself, it's too easy and therefore necessary to dismiss as vivid imagination.

Still, much can be gained by what the Tibetans call ""positive doubt"" and what in the west is known as ""willing suspension of disbelief"". If you can at least listen, you can move towards the central truth and that alone can break the chains of cyclic existence -- or so they say!",1,0,1444410161,1444722459

The goal is the opposite of life denying, you're confusing Buddhism with Schopenhauer, who appropriated Buddhism in service of his own pessimist philosophy.
