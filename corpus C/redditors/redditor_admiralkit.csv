cvxtud9,1,t3_3ojizz,admiralkit,"Honestly, this is the kind of decision that no one can make for you.  I can't tell you whether the longer commute is worth the extra pay and retirement matching.  I can't tell you whether the bonuses pay out regularly enough at company 2 to be worth it. I have no idea how realistically Company 2 thinks they're going to be sold, or who they're selling themselves to and whether that company will consider your position vital or redundant.  I have no idea if you'll feel bored and unsatisfied by the work company 1 wants you to do.  And most of all, I don't know what your long-term goals are and how those jobs fit into or change your goals.  

Without knowing any of that, there's not much I can say.  What do YOU want?  What is valuable to you - money and benefits and vacations or having more time in your normal day for your family?  Like many other things in life, there isn't a ""right"" answer and a ""wrong"" answer to this.  ",1,0,1444710963,1444723859
cvxthd9,1,t3_3ojil0,admiralkit,"So did you talk any pay for the receptionist position versus the data entry position?  Sounds a lot like a bait and switch to me - receptionist at least puts you out in front of people and being active, while data entry is (from what I've heard) boring and menial grunt work.  A cursory search of Glassdoor also indicates that data entry is a slightly lower paying position - $28.9k versus $32k for a receptionist position.  

If you're pressed for a job then it's at least a job, but I'm not sure I'd call it a step up for you.  There are a lot of factors that could make a data entry position a good entry onto the corporate ladder, but those same things going the other way can make it a dead end job that you'll hate inside of 3 months.",1,0,1444710202,1444723859

cvxpz2u,1,t3_3oj5ym,admiralkit,"I feel you on the travel thing, I was there myself once.  Ask your boss if he's got time for an informal sit-down meeting.  Let him know that the travel is wearing you down and making you unhappy and you'd like to change that.  Ask if there's anything that can be done to reduce and eliminate travel from your job responsibilities.

Your boss can't fix what he doesn't know is a problem, and knowing that you're unhappy is an order of magnitude harder if you're on the road all the time.  You can probably expect that any solution they come up with won't be an immediate fix, so be prepared to keep traveling in the near term.  And if you don't see any structural changes happen, it's time to dust off the CV.",3,0,1444704010,1444723859

cvxoe82,1,t3_3oiyvs,admiralkit,"Others may disagree with this, but don't lie.  If the hiring people find out you're lying during the course of due diligence, you're going to be immediately discounted.  

I'd recommend your choice of two alternate courses of action.  First choice, simply decline to list your previous salary.  This can be defended by saying that it's not really relevant to your negotiations, though is generally a sign that you're coming from a lower salary point (not blatantly so, though).

The other course I would consider is to list your current salary and ask for a small percentage higher than what you're looking for.  If they ask why you think you deserve such a pay increase, you say that you're looking for something commensurate with your skill level and experience.  They try to low-ball you, you tell them your salary numbers have a small amount of flexibility but not that much - get a better number or we'll go our separate ways.  It's a more aggressive strategy and requires you to potentially turn down a good opportunity, but if the other company likes you enough to extend you an offer you'll be surprised at how often they find the money in their budget or find other benefits to sweeten the deal (better 401k match, an extra week or two of vacation, guaranteed review at 90 days with a pay raise attached to it - make sure to get whatever they offer in writing so you can hold them to it).",2,0,1444701549,1444723859
cvxl28g,0,t1_cvxim4y,admiralkit,"We'd be in that kind of trouble with any other QB who isn't already HOF-bound.  Knocking on McCown for his limited mistakes and could-be mistakes isn't what this situation calls for.  We can't realistically expect the passing game to carry the team as much as they have game in and game out.  

Will McCown regress to a mean?  Yes.  Do I think that level of play will be below the Dalton line (whose namesake is proving himself to be above that line this year)? No*.  In the past four years, his completion percentage has averaged over 60% (total 25 games played), with that average being dragged down significantly by his getting murdered last year behind the Tampa Bay ~~turnstiles~~ ~~thick mist~~ offensive line.  His TD:INT ratio over those four years is 32:20, and that once again includes the disaster that was Tampa Bay's offense.  Four years is not an insignificant sample size.

*not without something around him changing, like one or two of our O-linemen going down. 

tl;dr - the problems on our team aren't related to McCown, who I don't think will average out as low as you do.  Don't blame him for mistakes he hasn't made yet when the defense can't get their shit together.",2,0,1444696438,1444723859
cvx0ski,0,t1_cvwtd61,admiralkit,"Well, yes, *some* of them will be interceptions.  Every QB in the league will throw a few interceptions this year.  The only QBs this season who don't have interceptions yet this season are Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady, and nobody here is arguing that McCown is at a caliber of a HOF QB.  McCown WILL have interceptions, but as long as he manages to keep a respectable TD:INT ratio and a respectable completion % then it isn't an issue.  

Sure, his numbers won't look this good all season, but when's the last time he played regular games behind an O-line as good as ours?  I don't expect they'll regress as much as you think they will.",2,0,1444665909,1444723859
cvwiypx,0,t1_cvwe9xw,admiralkit,"The problem is that too many fans get unreasonable about wanting to win today.  The more irritable the fans get, the more the media starts picking up on the irritation and starts stirring the controversy pot. The more controversy is stirred up, the more pressure the team feels the need to do something - teams require the goodwill of the fans to succeed, after all. And when they respond, they do dumb things.

I hope to whatever dieties may exist that behind closed doors Haslam has told Pettine and Farmer they have 4 uninterrupted years to do their jobs and actually build a team with a system, but that in public they all have to toe the ""We want to win now"" line for PR's sake.  I honestly feel that Manziel has the potential to win more games this season than McCown, but that doing so would really cap his ceiling because of how it would impact his learning NFL-caliber football.  I would rather go 5-11 under McCown the entire season if it meant Manziel could consistently take us over .500 for a long career as our franchise QB.",2,0,1444617975,1444723859
