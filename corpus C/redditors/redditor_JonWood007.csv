cvxufm9,1,t3_3oio35,JonWood007,"He's probably stronger than the average footsoldier (average power level around raditz level), but a little weaker than friend's elite guard and significantly weaker than the ginyu force. He was 18k. Cui was 18k. Dodoria was 22k. Zarbon could reach up to like 28-30k or something. The ginyu force was 18-120k, with the 18k guy having psychic powers.

So Vegeta was no footsoldier but he was likely not very high ranked. I'm guessing he led missions with other saiyans, but that's about it. I'm guessing all things considered he was a lower mid to mid level guy.",1,1,1444712295,1444722470

Changes are gonna be minimal if implemented at all. Compare it to siege of shanghai in bf4. There are next to no changes to the map itself. The only real improvement I noticed was it went from running like crap to being playable in the final product.",1,0,1444689769,1444722470
