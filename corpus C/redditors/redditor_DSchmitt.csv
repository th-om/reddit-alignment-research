cvvlmk4,0,t1_cvvheow,DSchmitt,"Abortion doesn't equal killing the fetus. Abort means to end before completion. It's aborting the pregnancy. A c-section is an abortion, technically. Yes, I think abortion one day before due date can be ethical.

Even if the fetus can't survive outside someone else's body, it's their choice to use their own body, risking their health (no matter how slight or great a risk... still a risk), in order to save the life of someone else. In some of those cases, there is the fact that there is no current medical technology to keep a fetus alive after being removed from a womb.

It's the exact same thing with blood donors, bone marrow donors, kidney donors. We can't force any of those. Even if their are no other options to save the life of another person, and we have the unfortunate fact that there is no alternate medical technology to keep someone alive. Even in the case that someone agreed to try and save them already, then changed their minds. Never, save if a person consents to use their body in that way. The instant there is no more consent, it's illegal and I would say immoral to continue using someone's body to try and save someone else.

We can't force someone to give even a single drop of their blood to save someone else. Even if it's their born and grown child. Someone that's definitely and unarguably a person, and someone they have chosen to have and raise. So no, I don't think it's ever okay to remove someone's bodily autonomy and force them to use and risk their whole selves (pregnancy goes much beyond just the womb) to sustain the life of their child. Not even one day before due date.",1,0,1444545302,1444726160

cvs87rp,1,t3_3nwegd,DSchmitt,"Some fungus is parasitic and bad for a tree. Some are good for a tree as it breaks down soil and provides nutrients.

It's not the typical yellow houseplant species... could be interesting. Get pictures of the cap, from the side, and the underside where it connects to the stem. Post to /r/mycology for a possible ID, if you want to see if it's harmful or not. A spoor print would be helpful as well (put just the cap on some white paper overnight, then look at the color of the spoors left behind). It doesn't sound like the typical yellow potted plant mushroom, at least. :)  ",1,0,1444284814,1444726160

Sanders has a fair bit of support among conservatives for many of his positions, such as [publicly financed election campaigns](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163208/half-support-publicly-financed-federal-campaigns.aspx), which more than 40% of Republicans want. That's for fully public funded... nearly 80% support limits on funding. On another of Bernie's big issues, 40% of Conservatives think that our current [wealth distribution is unfair](http://www.gallup.com/poll/182987/americans-continue-say-wealth-distribution-unfair.aspx).

The elected of the Democratic party are often right of center neo-liberals, such as Hillary or Obama. The effects of their policies aren't supported by most Americans. The fact that the media doesn't report this demonstrates their pro-Corporate, anti-left bias.",2,0,1443166829,1444726160

cvdhkfn,0,t1_cvchif8,DSchmitt,"So you do things backwards - believing in things before they've been confirmed? There's an unending amount of things that could be, many contradictory. How do you decide which of those unconfirmed things are true?

Evidence needs to lead to conclusions, not beliefs lead the evidence. Prove it's right, win that Nobel and JREF award for doing so. Until then, you're just some nut spouting the exact same nonsense as those 'pop astrology' people you agree are nonsense, or those bigfoot chaser, or homeopathy, or acupuncture, or UFO abductees, etc.

No, I don't want to waste my time listening to that or the literally unending amount of 'well it _could_ be! it hasn't been shown wrong!' out there. If you had real evidence, it'd be accepted. Scientists love new facts.",1,0,1443160290,1444726160
