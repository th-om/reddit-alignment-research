cvkcejm,0,t1_cvjw0ng,Hevil,"I've always thought of Machiavelli as being something more akin to a revolutionary author. Whilst previous political theorists had obviously wanted to affect political practice, by and large they were all describing something similar to what already existed, or at least, would not require a great departure from them. Machiavelli, meanwhile is trying to restore the Florentine republic, and the Prince is more of a guide to what would be necessary to maintain such a state.

From the Discourses;
>As to changing these institutions all at once when everyone recognizes they are not good, I say that the defect which is easily recognized is difficult to correct, for to do this it is not enough to use ordinary means, as ordinary means are bad, but it is necessary to come to the extraordinary, such as violence and arms, and before anything else to become Prince of that City, and to be able to dispose of it as he pleases.",4,0,1443694064,1444723690
cve9lna,1,t3_3mdj4b,Hevil,"No real formal economics knowledge, but my basic understanding is this; supply side policies increase the basic productive capacity of the economy.

So, the economy has so many people, buildings, natural resources and machinery that allow it to produce a certain amount of goods and services each year. The actual amount of that capacity used will vary as the overall level of demand changes, as demand is much more volatile than supply. Supply side policies are those that are meant to increase that productive capacity. Usually, this is interpreted as meaning deregulation, as in theory deregulation will allow existing resources to be used more efficiently, however a number of other policies, such as spending on infrastructure and education can also be interpreted as supply side. Essentially demand-side policies can only go so far, as they are limited by the physical capacity of the economy, but supply-side policies ought to increase the long-term growth of the economy.

Trickle-down economics simply states that a reduction in the burden on the upper-classes will come to benefit the lower classes. The association with supply-side policies is this; generally, only the rich invest. Note invest here doesn't really mean financial investment (stocks, bonds etc.), but spending that increases the productive capacity of the economy, which means spending money on new machinery, training etc. This is because the poor, and even middle classes can not/do not defer consumption (basically invest in the future). So, if you make the rich richer (say by cutting taxes), they will invest more, and thus the overall supply of the economy will grow faster. In theory.

Basically, supply-side policies aren't necessarily to do with taxes cuts although the argument is often framed that way.",2,0,1443221036,1444723690
