cvx31ed,1,t3_3ogtdu,lollersauce914,"Judaism is a religion that can allows converts like any other. However, since very few people convert and most jews take up the religion due to it being part of their ancestry, and since jews often lived in insular communities alongside people of other faiths but rarely intermarried, there are distinct ethnicities that are highly associated with the faith. These ethnicities are often simply called ""jewish"" (which is confusing) but that doesnt mean someone of a different ethnicity who practices the religion of judiasm isnt jewish. Its just that the same word is used to to describe these ethnicities as is used to describe people who practice the faith.


Edit: it would be kind of like if we called all people from india ""hindus"" despite the fact that many people in india practice other faiths and many people who are not of indian ancestry also practice hinduism.",2,0,1444669399,1444721466
