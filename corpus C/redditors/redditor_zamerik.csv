cusrg36,0,t1_cusq8hc,zamerik,"What I think Huckabee was referring to regarding the school funding was that he had to take it back to the legislature because they are the fiscal body that had to fund the newly mandated program.  I think he was trying to lead the listener to believe that they had to pass new ""laws"" to support this, when in reality they just had to fund the new program (whether through new appropriations or a new budget).  This is different from same-sex marriage ruling because the court simply said it was unconstitutional to ban same-sex marriage.  Same as Roe v Wade, no new laws had to be passed for the court ruling to be followed.  Please correct me if I am wrong, but this was my interpretation.",2,0,1441570213,1444730712
