cvv1k2j,0,t1_cvupicy,bartoksic,">you are still not aware of every single company policy at every single time, it's just impossible.

Good thing you don't need to. All it takes is Yelp, Amazon reviews or word of mouth to let you know whether a business hates gays or something. 

>It's simply a fallacy to believe that the free market can take care of this.

You haven't demonstrated this at all. It's assertion without argument.

>let's not pretend that there is anything you can reasonably do as a consumer that effects the ethical responsibilities of any business.

This is quite the ahistorical view. Plenty of companies have had their policies shaped by public values. Look at Starbucks and Fair Trade programs, or McDonalds and their cage-free egg initiative. 

Market forces are fundamentally the same as those in a democracy. If you don't think the market can address a problem, then how on earth is governance supposed to?",-1,0,1444505247,1444717918
cvu5ky1,1,t3_3o4kpe,bartoksic,"That's hilarious. 

On a more serious note, Lincoln was a very complicated man. I have a lot of respect for Abraham Lincoln as a man and a leader. He accomplished tremendously great things against an actively undermining legislative branch, an almost treasonous (figuratively) cabinet and an incompetent and disarrayed military (not to mention half the country withdrawing from the union). He proved to be a genius administrator, motivator and leader, while also proving to be a terrible husband and father. And the Civil War was the most massive, senseless, and tragic loss of American lives in our history. 

You can still respect the man while condemning his decisions.",3,0,1444425357,1444717918
