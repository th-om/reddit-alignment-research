Every political philosophy starts with assumptions about human nature before anything of note can be said about the larger purpose for society or government, and certainly about specific policies of government.

You might think that these are esoteric questions, but if you can answer them you'll have a more solid foundation for your thoughts... or maybe you'll uncover contradictions in your basic assumptions that really will change your view.  ",3,0,1444424007,1444727452
