cvq6pz6,0,t1_cvq67hf,olcrazypete,"Just saw a mythbusters episode about how to get out of car in water,  and they tested several things to break the side glass.  Apparently the window glass is presurized.  Kicking it hard, hitting it with anything rather large doesn't work well, but a small hard thing shatters it immediately.  The Little hammer thing worked like magic.  
Sounded like if you see the car begin to flood, open the door immediately - once there is a certain amount of water surrounding it, the door isn't gonna open until enough water comes into the car to equalize the pressure. ",8,0,1444146849,1444724215
cvowegc,0,t1_cvnwtgx,olcrazypete,"I was proud of the team that played hard in 2012, a good showing and a close game is one thing.  When a team that on paper, when compared objectively against common opponents, looks to be on par with another or in some cases miles better (UF 2014), just folds and falls apart to a huge loss, that is the issue.   2012 SEC Championship, luck.  2013? SCar beatdown, not luck.  UF last year, not luck.  This monstrosity, not luck. I get the argument that if not Richt, who do you get that is better?  I look at Tennessee and see our future if the wrong choices are made.  I just don't understand how the same old 'not mentally prepared' part keeps happening. ",1,0,1444053772,1444724215

We actually lucked into a ride straight from the lodge to the Polynesian for a Ohana breakfast, the boat was running a training and the captain was nice enough to offer.  If they aren't crowded, it turns into a guided tour of the area.  ",1,0,1443998766,1444724215
cvoarbu,1,t3_3n55a9,olcrazypete,"I'm actually on a magical express bus back to airport after a week at Wilderness Lodge.  I liked the resort a lot, but was family's first trip so not a lot to base it on. Kids liked the hidden Mickey scavenger hunt a lot.  The coolest thing though, my wife had been told to ask about being a 'flag family'.  We did it this morning.  We all got to go up to the roof of the lodge for the flag raising.  It is an incredible view up there, you can see all 4 parks from there, with a great view of magic kingdom.  Will be posting pics later. Afterward we were allowed to hang out on the club level and have breakfast at the continental type breakfast area there.  Amounted to a short private tour.  ",2,0,1443998604,1444724215

cvoa20v,1,t3_3negm9,olcrazypete,"We were there.  Had reservations in the 50s Primetime Cafe and a group that were dressed up were taking pics in the 'living room' area in the lobby.  It was so cool, they blended in perfect with the rest of the decor there.   ",1,0,1443997459,1444724215
