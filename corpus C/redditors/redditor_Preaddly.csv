I wasn't about to reward her with my compliance, then it would've happened more often.

We have two groups here, one is of the belief that morality belongs in the home and in the heart while the other wants it to be the law of the land.

Hate speech laws exist because if it doesn't certain groups are going to rail against other groups who are just trying to live their lives. Some libs want to ban guns, most just want it so there's a bit of consideration before selling a deadly weapon to just anybody, like needing to pass a test and have a license to drive a car. The secularism angle is an acknowledgement that more than one religion exists in the world so rather than spend all day letting every single one say their own prayers before every publicly funded event it's easier just to not let any do it, that's what's **fair** to everyone. Freedom of association means people are going to be purposely left out, which would be an infringement on their rights as American citizens and therefore won't be supported. Affirmative action is to keep people's personal beliefs from affecting the workforce by bribing employers to hire people they normally wouldn't, we do this because forcing them would be an infringement on the employer's rights, if we don't minorities won't be hired which is an infringement on *their* rights. Taxation and redistribution through welfare programs ensures American citizens won't be living on the street or dropping dead left and right, it makes us look bad. 

Freedom is a bad word to use in these contexts, you and I probably have a different definition anyway. A lot of conservative policies will disenfranchise their fellow Americans, this goes against the idea of what it means to be born on American soil. Proposition 8 was popular, but it infringed on certain American's rights that others have therefore it shouldn't be allowed, see how that works? Same thing with moderate policy, is it infringing on certain American's rights that others get to enjoy? Then no we're not considering it, we're not considering anything that will disenfranchise any Americans regardless of the choices they've made. Considering that rubric alone many conservative policies can't be met, taking away half of a person's rights as Americans won't work either. ",-1,0,1444409359,1444720396

cvts57o,0,t1_cvtp26e,Preaddly,"(Social) Conservative policies if passed wouldn't just be unpopular, they would limit freedoms. Traditional nuclear family households are a great ideal but the legislature needed to make that kind of thing happen in practice are the same policies that have been fought against and overturned in the past. Same thing with any new deal policies, they're popular. Conservative and liberal voters alike don't want social security cut under any circumstances. 

If respect for ~~the minority~~ conservatives means undermining the social and fiscal policies that voters have fought for, benefit from, and enjoy the most what choice do democratic politicians have? In short, if conservative ideals don't at all involve minorities or women, don't involve tampering with new deal policies, don't only benefit the wealthy or business owners, and won't lead to anyone having to go without, then yeah let's talk.

cvnyr8b,1,t3_3ncwh7,Preaddly,"The problem is that administrators are put in a tough position. They have to promote social acceptance of those that are or choose to be different when they themselves may not agree, or will make their own jobs that much harder. 

Our social narrative (whether you like it or not) is that no one has the authority to forcibly influence an ""other"" to conform to their personal idea of acceptable behavior unless that ""other"" is acting in a way that is *intentionally* causing physical or psychological harm. These are the foundations of the phrases, ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all"", and, ""Everyone has the right to be offended"". 

That means in theory if little Billy wants to come to school with a shirt that says ""bullshit"" on it he can, in practice the dress code says he can't. And if asks why he can't he's told whatever will shut him up so the teacher can go back to teaching. These types of rules push a narrative that goes against societal expectations but to ignore those rules would lead to disruptions in the classroom, what's an administrator to do? Those children are going to be spending their formative years in that environment, what will they be thinking when they see Billy all grown up wearing a shirt with ""bullshit"" on it?
