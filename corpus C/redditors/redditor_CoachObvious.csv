Each block is leased to a company like Shell/BP/Chevron, known as the ""Operator"". Before they bid on the rights to drill they conduct surveys via 3rd party. The operator decides if a block is worth exploring and will submit a blind bid. Highest bid wins the block. Then the operator must evaluate the formation and come up with a plan to drill a well(s). After the well plan has been created, a rig must be contracted to drill it. Often times outfitted to the operators specifications for the well. A well head built and casing intervals ordered. At this point several years have passed. Finally they begin to drill. Each we'll takes 4-12 months to drill and complete. If it bears any oil or gas, it has to be produced by a production facility, additional pipelines to existing platforms are build or an entire production facility. So from the time the block is leased, it could be 10 plus years before any oil is refined. Oil may be cheap right now, but in 10-15 years when these wells are flowing, oil will be much higher.

But it was one of those nightmares a little ways into I realized it was a nightmare and forced myself to wake up. So I woke up, scared and anxious because I was trying to get away from someone. I couldn't move, just opened my eyes and knew I was breathing. Tried moving with all my power but could only get my index finger to slightly twitch. At this point I question whether I was in a dream or reality. Did the person get me? Is this what it feels like to die. I knew it was a dream, so I start to have a panic attack. I didn't understand why I couldn't move to shake off the nightmare. After about 10 or 15 minutes of forcing my finger to wiggle I managed to wake the rest of my body up and let it go through the panic attack. ",1,0,1432614866,1444728618
