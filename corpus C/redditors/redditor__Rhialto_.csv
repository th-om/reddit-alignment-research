We've been through the same hell, you and I, and we survived because the fires inside burned brighter than the fires around us. We fell down into that dark chasm, but the flame burned on and on . . .

Seriously, though, that movie is terrible. And awesome. Right up there with [Mitchell](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073396/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1).",2,0,1444699627,1444727777
cvxlsbq,0,t1_cvwwxlw,_Rhialto_,"^ ^ ^ This guy/gal gets it. Pretending that horrific crimes are less horrific just because some time has passed is basically giving carte blanche to people in the present to do whatever the want, safe in the knowledge that their actions will be justified or forgiven in the future. Let's all maybe just stop looking for excuses to hate and hurt each other and focus on our commonalities, cheesy as it may sound.

Also, is your username a reference to The Final Sacrifice, that classic of Canadian cinema once featured on MST3K?",2,0,1444697563,1444727777

cvwhgab,0,t1_cvvw8g8,_Rhialto_,"The same evidence I have that anyone near me at any given time isn't about to kill me: none. Yet I don't assume that just because there are a lot of white murderers or a lot of black murderers that every white or black person is just one bad day away from going on a killing spree.

Thinking like that is the dark side of humanity's gift for pattern recognition. We learn fast, we can extrapolate and make connections that other organisms can't -- but all that leaves us looking for patterns everywhere. Two black guys robbed people in my city recently? Must be *all* the black guys are criminal. Lots of Muslims in the middle east are assholes? Must be *all* the Muslims are. But drawing conclusions like that is letting your primitive, tribal need for protection and xenophobia get the better of you. We should evaluate people on an individual basis, not based on the broad tendencies of (often arbitrarily assigned) groups. ""Us vs. them"" is a game that rarely ends well for either group, and is satisfying only in the way that being a bully is satisfying: it makes us feel strong and safe to pull together with others like ourselves and shit all over another group we haven't bothered trying to understand.

And I know why that is. It's because you *can't* understand a whole group. But the point I was trying to make above is that you don't need to. Though we may be social animals, it's a well-established fact of sociology that any given group of people has a wider range of differences between its individual members than the group as a whole has with another. That means that shuffling people around into categories -- categories that can change or become outdated based on social trends or arbitrary decisions -- is an ineffective way of dealing with individuals. So you can either lump the good in with the bad just because it's easier for you to handle that way, or you can accept that a person isn't defined by the groups they belong to and their beliefs, values, and likely future behaviors are best learned by actually acquainting yourself with the person in question.",1,0,1444615285,1444727777

Honestly, after Oregon, I would like to see our elected officials do *something* concrete and substantive. Literally anything. Instead they just keep yelling about guns and mental health then not following up with any proposals or legislation whatsoever. ",0,0,1444577908,1444727777

When in history have people said, ""Well, we're being marginalized and singled out for vitriolic hatred and possible violence. Let's just settle down and not react badly to this""? Never. That has not happened. Treating people like this is actually a damn fine way to *create* terrorists, meaning that if you're right (and they're all terrorists) you gain nothing by doing this, while if you're *wrong* (and they aren't terrorists) you run the risk of both mistreating innocents for no reason while also creating the very thing you hoped to destroy.",1,0,1444533379,1444727777
