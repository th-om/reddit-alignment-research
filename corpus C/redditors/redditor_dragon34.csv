cvv4vez,0,t1_cvuzund,dragon34,"What about cases of horrible birth defects that all but guarantee a quick and painful death? 

I think it is a complicated question, and I am an atheist as well, but I believe that outlawing abortion (at least in the first trimester) doesn't just say that the fetus is a human life, it says that a fetus's continued existence is more important than the quality of life of the woman who is carrying it, and I don't think that's OK.  There are women who get pregnant, have no side effects, are glowingly happy and healthy the whole time, have jobs with generous leave policies and for whom a pregnancy and raising a child is not a financial or emotional burden, but it is completely irresponsible to ignore the fact that pregnancy is, for some, a mental and physical trial where you are beholden to a biological process for nearly a year, and for some people could quite literally destroy their lives.  The US does not mandate paid maternity leave.  The US does not mandate paid sick leave.  Terrible morning sickness that leaves women incapacitated is not uncommon.  Losing a job that doesn't provide sick leave because you miss work because you are incapable of physically working is also not uncommon.  As a country I believe that working towards a situation where abortion is only necessary in the case of rape or horrible birth defects would be a great situation, but to do that, we have to fix a lot of societal problems.

A)  Safe, effective methods of birth control MUST BE TAUGHT to all our teenagers, religion be damned.

B) BC must be available to teenagers, without parental consent, religion be damned.  BC must be available to adults free or low cost if income qualifies.  I'm also adding that people should be able to get surgically sterilized without consent of spouses.  Also, women should be able to be surgically sterilized before they have had children.  I have a friend who desperately wanted to be sterilized and she couldn't find a doctor to do it, it was all very condescending ""Oh honey, you'll change your mind""  ""Oh honey, what if your husband decides he wants children""  

C) All employers need to offer a reasonable number of paid sick days, and a reasonable number of paid vacation days (not to be combined) and paid maternity/paternity leave of at least 6 weeks (8 in case of c-ssections)

D) Emergency contraception should remain available, and all pharmacies must have at least one pharmacist willing to provide it when needed.

E)  Foster programs need to be more closely monitored, and adoption costs need to be brought under control in some way, either by tax deductions or some other method.  Adoption from all agencies needs to be available to single parents who check out, as well as homosexual couples who check out, religion be damned.  It's about making sure children who are unwanted by their bio parents have good homes, not about upholding some outdated model of what a traditional family looks like.  If we're really going to try to be about ""family values"" that's what that means.  It means that our government supports families.  ALL families.   Whether or not some book or collection of books says it's OK.

Edit: F) Something needs to be done about rape culture.  ""boys will be boys"" is not OK.  Victim blaming is not OK.  
It being considered a badge of honor to get drunk enough to black out is not OK. I don't think people should have to sign consent forms before having sex, but I think society in general (especially in the teens and early 20s) encourages situations where consent can be nebulous.  If two blacked out people fuck, did they rape each other or were they both too far out of control to be responsible for their actions?  If each of them willingly drank enough untainted alcohol or ingested enough untainted drugs to get them into that state, I don't believe either party should be charged with anything.  Obviously if someone spiked a drink, the spiker is responsible for their actions.

TL;DR:
Pregnancy isn't like picking up a bag of chips at the grocery store, we don't have a financial support structure in place for all women, and unwanted children need to be given the best chance of life.  A religious view of what that looks like is less important than a child's life, so there needs to be a lot less tolerance of religion being used to deny people education, tools, prophylactics and medicine with regard to birth control, and a lot less tolerance of religiously based restriction of what makes an acceptable adoptive family.",4,0,1444511344,1444727636
