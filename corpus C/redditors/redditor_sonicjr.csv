Cue my continuing and current interest in latex and furry porn over 10 years later, that's where it all started.

And to clarify, being into furries doesn't necessarily mean that you want to ""become"" one or find regular animals enticing. Furry fandom and beastiality both creep me out big time.",2,0,1443566521,1444716741
