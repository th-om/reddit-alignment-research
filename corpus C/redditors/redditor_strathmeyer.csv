Uh no this is the first time you are asking this. I assume I know more than you because I don't feel compelled to say nonsensical, unethical things. I know enough about ethics not to insult someone simply because they disagree with me.

> So if you want to decrease the number of deaths from harvesting, you should still not eat animals.

Unless I want to decrease the number of human deaths or amount of human suffering. How many humans die needlessly because they are tricked into unhealthy diets?

> Also... What do you think the animals most people have the meat of eat? These animals eat plants, plants that are typically harvested in the way you mention.
