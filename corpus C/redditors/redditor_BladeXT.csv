cutmeb7,0,t1_cutliow,BladeXT,"You do realize that you had to invent the word ""pre-classified"" in order to justify what she did? This was sensitive information that was classified just as soon as she was forced to release it. 

She was the Secretary of State. Just stop and digest that for a second. She was the *Secretary of State*. She was *making* classified information. 

I guess that for the Clintons ignorance and incompetence are always valid excuses in the eyes of her supporters. ",2,0,1441648147,1444729012
cutl1ao,0,t1_cutir3z,BladeXT,">Everything that has been revealed so far was not classified at the time she sent/recieved it, but was made classified later

I find it weird as fuck that people are using that as some sort of excuse. Do you think that when the Chinese hackers start downloading stuff from the server it's OK because ""it wasn't classified yet""?

She was the *Secretary of State*. **She** was the one responsible for this.

She was on the phone with her friend, trying to convince the friend to move here. The big selling point was that the parole officers in WB hardly ever check up on the people they are assigned to. 

I don't know if that's true, but it certainly seemed to be believable. And whether it's true or not, NEPA must have a reputation for either being soft on crime or being totally incompetent.",5,0,1428380080,1444729012

cp85noq,1,t3_2yc8bn,BladeXT,"Republicans are ""butthurt"" about it because people died because Obama thought it would hurt his re-election campaign to admit that there was a terrorist attack on his watch. He refused to send assistance to the embassy while the attack was occurring, and then lied and said that it was just a ""protest"" that got out of hand instead of a planned terrorist attack.
