cvvwt2b,0,t1_cvvlru0,Mildly-Offensive,">Still hard to adjust accurately. 

It's really not. Even if you don't adjust for eras and just directly compare his numbers with his peers, other than wins, he wasn't in the top 10 in any category. And he played in what was literally the weakest era for goalies. ",1,0,1444580977,1444729346
cvvwnx0,0,t1_cvvnb4t,Mildly-Offensive,"> Fuhr was never about stats. He was about stopping breakaways, 2-on-1's and 3-on-1's and being clutch in the playoffs.

Ah yes, Grant ""He will give up 6 but stop the 7th!"" Fuhr. That's such stupid argument. People have to throw  tradition analysis out of window and come up with completely arbitrary reasons to justify him being in the HOF. It's nothing short of a double standard. ",1,0,1444580719,1444729346
cvvl1x5,0,t1_cvvjeuj,Mildly-Offensive,"Yeah but like I said, even after you adjust his numbers for his era, they weren't that good. ",1,0,1444543451,1444729346
cvvj4qq,0,t1_cvviz3k,Mildly-Offensive,"> Fuhr was considered pretty good by 80s standards.

Yeah, because of his win totals. Go look up his individual stats compared to his peers, they're garbage. Adjusted for era, they're actually worse than Osgood. Fuhr was completely forgettable after he left Edmonton and didn't have a dynasty in front of him. ",2,0,1444538490,1444729346
cvvisof,0,t1_cvvii8e,Mildly-Offensive,"Wouldn't be any worse than Fuhr. Exact same situation as Osgood, but everyone gives him a free pass. ",9,0,1444537771,1444729346
