Check your fuel lines, I think your problem is either a blockage in the fuel line or a dirty fuel filter or fuel is not getting into the carb bowl. 

Also there may be a fuel pump. ",1,0,1443814243,1444724443
cvm0gw3,0,t1_cvm00op,iiiiiiiiiiii,"The best would be to blow all the carb cleaner out with compressed air, but yes you could wipe shake and let air dry the parts. 

You'll need to take the carb off the engine to work on it.

here's a pic i found quickly;

thats a carb 

I'm not sure about that design, but you could take those philips screws out and investigate.

cvlzv0m,1,t3_3n8yiu,iiiiiiiiiiii,"You don't need stabil unless you are going to store the gas for six months <more or less> so stop putting that in. Just buy small amounts of gas, like three gallons at a time, why get six if it just ends up sitting in the tank going bad. usually there's an air bleed screw on the tanks gas cap, it should be open<loose> to let air in. Check your fuel lines, its a ONE WAY path, the prime bulb should be near the tank, If you put the fuel line on backwards, fuel wont go to the carb. 

One thing you could do in the future is disconnect the fuel line at the motor and let the engine run out of gas. this way you wont have any fuel in the carb bowl to evaporate and leave gum behind. 

its not all that hard to take a single carb off yourself. Get a chair and a table and put a piece of cardboard down to work on. have a can of carb cleaner on hand. You wont be taking the WHOLE thing apart, so looking at exploded pics can be deceiving. You probably really will not need any instructions. Just take the bowl off, look inside the bottom of the bowl. Usually there is a large needle connected to the bowl float, this lets the fuel flow into the bowl and shuts it off when full. Where that large needle goes into the main body of the carb- well look inside that hole with a flashlight, there may be a brass fitting you can unscrew and clean out. 

Take all the adjustment needles out and pay attention to how many turns it took to get them out. Once you shoot carb cleaner in there you can screw them back in about where the were. Dont over tighten the screws, this is pot metal and you dont want to strip the holes.  

Look for all the fittings that have screw heads on them, take them all off and blow through with cleaner. WEAR EYE PROTECTION! You dont want stuff in your eyes. Blow through any opening with the carb cleaner. Put it all back together.

Pay attention to linkage and where it goes so you can put back the same. You probably dont need to write it all down, just have a few hours set aside when you can do all this undisturbed.

Good you are using ethanol free. Are you sure the 75-100:1 is correct?

Edit: I'm not familiar with this exact motor. There is probably that one main needle and one mixture needle. Its not that complicated. that shop you used may not have done a great job, you can do better.

Also, it usually take about half the time you were together to get over it. Lets say you were together 6 years, it'll take 3 for you to get over it. Thats just a guideline, you might feel better next week!

If it were mine, I would buy the battery and hope that's it. After you put it in, take the old battery to the store for the core deposit refund and ask them to test your charging system, it's free.
