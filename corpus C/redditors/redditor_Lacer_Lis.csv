You really don't need to call them by their first name anyways, just say ""hey you"" (always works). Though I guess it would be weird if it got serious and your parents were ask you about your sister, and you start talking about your girlfriend, or vice versa. ",1,0,1444639528,1444723438

Also, thuganomics John Cena would be cool at first, just because of nostalgia and being novel, but it would became lame very quickly because acting that way isn't cool anymore. Thuganomics John Cena of 2015 would have to adapt the character a bit to what current fads and trends are.",1,0,1444636896,1444723438

cvwmvg0,0,t1_cvw9cmc,Lacer_Lis,"You are giving too much credit to people and not enough credit to corporate companies who do a pretty good job at making unhealthy products seem fine. You'd think Anti-smoking ads are there to help people quit or stop being from starting, but they are paid for by tobacco companies because they actually make smokers more likely not to quit. Addiction is emotional, not logical. Arguing that people are logical and wont get addicted to hard drugs when they are made legal is a dead end argument because logic doesn't play into it, emotion does. ",3,0,1444625874,1444723438

You kind of look like [John Baizley](http://media.philly.com/images/600*308/20130523_inq_ddabaron23z-b.JPG) from Baroness. I think you look better with the beard, but you have to find a beard style that suits you well. You also need better photos. You look kind of creep and angry in your profile pic, and you don't have a normal selfie of just you face on. Go into the bathroom right now and take one, it'll help.

Is it even feasible to do that with all of them or even half? My mom gets scammed on a regular basis, but her memory is fine and she's 55. I don't have the means to get her assisted living. And if I did, she's to a point where she can still fight it. I can understand an 81 year old with Alzheimers might just accept it, but anyone with early stage dementia isn't to a point where they would accept being 'controlled' like that ",1,0,1444460635,1444723438
