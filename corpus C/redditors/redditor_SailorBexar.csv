cvxegsw,0,t1_cvxe7do,SailorBexar,Our one cold game experience. That was pretty brutal in my opinion but the fact that we were on the verge of winning the B12 made it enjoyable. Well that and hand warmers. ,3,0,1444685865,1444727409
cvxdnuz,0,t1_cvxd5fq,SailorBexar,"That's it, they aren't bending to our demands. We are leaving the conference and going independent. Our national brand will carry us forward.

Now we can schedule whatever 12 cupcakes we want.

He clearly needs help. I hope he can get his life back in order and return to a successful coaching career someday. ",2,0,1444682142,1444727409

If only rankings were treated like shit until the end of the season my friend. ",0,0,1444676454,1444727409

cvx6j63,0,t1_cvx6505,SailorBexar,"LOL. Texas and ""good"" should not be used in the same sentence.

My point is that Cal is likely slightly over rated at this point in the season. They will be underdogs when they play @UCLA, @Oregon, and @Stanford. This will be favored against Oregon state and will likely open at even line against USC and Arizona State.

I see them ending the season at 8-4 or 7-5. Solid season but not spectacular and not T25 worthy. ",1,0,1444674478,1444727409
cvx5xg1,0,t1_cvx5cfg,SailorBexar,"That's more of an indictment on Utah, not a praise for Cal. They couldn't win by more than a TD against a team that turned the ball over so much. ",1,0,1444673614,1444727409
