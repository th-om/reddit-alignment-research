cvx9wb2,1,t3_3ohnph,crateguy,"For the most part, 5th and pathfinder are pretty close.  Spells are one of the big differences.  Spells level up with the player in a lot of cases, this means one could cast a lower level spell with a higher level spell slot for increased effects or benefits.  This clears ups some of the clutter in spellbooks.  For example, The cure light, moderate, serious critical, and so on spells are just the ""Cure Wounds"" spell now.  This spell's effects are increased as the spell slot used increases in level.  Skills and saving throws are now based on a combination of ability score bonus and proficiency bonus instead of being based on class and ranks.  Armor class remains relatively static throughout play as compared to pathfinder.  Hit bonus remains relatively static as well (only really increasing with ability score gains and improved armor).  Magic items are more for flavor, so the frequency with which they appear is limited.  A character can only be attuned to three magic items at a time as opposed to the 10 or so slots that can be filled by magic items in pathfinder.  Magic is more ""potent"" than ""powerful.""  Spells are less likely to break games and more likely to deal additional damage.

Also, a lot of bonuses and penalties have been removed and replaced by the ""advantage"" system.  Instead of giving a modifier to your next attack, skill, saving throw, or whatever roll, the advantage system merely give the player an advantage or disadvantage to the roll.  Advantage means rolling twice and taking the better result of the two, disadvantage means rolling twice and taking the worse of the two.  That's all I can think of off the top of my head.",1,0,1444679322,1444718382
