cvxwnjv,0,t1_cvx9ryo,astrawnomore,Agreed. It's not just about how easy the job is; it's about the time someone has to take out of their day to do it.,1,1,1444718788,1444725492
cvxqtyk,1,t3_3oi9tl,astrawnomore,"I've had at least two friendships like this where I eventually had to end the friendship. I basically went with the fade away in both cases and appeared a dick to both of them, and they both hate me now. There's not really any nice way to do it.",2,0,1444705405,1444725492

cvu2e9f,0,t1_cvu1o0r,astrawnomore,"I appreciate your response, sorry you got downvoted. I disagree however. I don't think either Bernie fans or Tea Partiers use ""moving away from the center"" as a strategy or motivation. The Tea Party *is* far-from-center, but only because of their extreme beliefs of practically eliminating taxes and social programs. Bernie has some rather left ideas, but he's also got a lot of support of conservatives too.",-2,0,1444420389,1444725492
cvu1hr9,0,t1_cvtx2mx,astrawnomore,"Best you can do is try them on. I find that Vans fit about as expected. And contrary to /u/mrdaveharry Vans are some of the most comfortable shoes I can buy, no insoles needed.",2,0,1444419013,1444725492
cvu0oha,0,t1_cvtzcod,astrawnomore,"The reason Bernie supporters take issue with Bill's assessment is that it's just full of a lot of implicit BS. Bernie supporters aren't motivated by blind anger, and the anger that is there isn't irrational. The system *is* rigged, and Bernie himself says that he can't make any serious changes by himself if elected. Instead, he just wants to raise political consciousness regardless of whether he is elected.

Comparison with the Tea Party is also uncalled for, and in fact I can't even imagine how that is a valid parallel in any rational person's mind.",14,0,1444417782,1444725492

cvu0642,0,t1_cvtne0m,astrawnomore,"I have spent a lot of time at Duke Hospital in my life (relative works there), and I grew up loving hospitals and medicine because of how cool the place was. The campus is like a miniature city all on its own. Even now as I finish up my undergrad in physics, my experiences there influenced me to angle toward a medical physics specialty. Duke is great :) are you a fan of their basketball?",1,0,1444417022,1444725492
cvt0xgz,0,t1_cvt0o0h,astrawnomore,"""Bug"" isn't the same thing as ""insect"". Colloquially it means anything creepy-crawly.",1,0,1444342870,1444725492
cvsrlwl,0,t1_cvsnnzf,astrawnomore,I am at the doctors office for my university right now. Just sat down after putting a medical parking pass on my dash from the secretary. Already got a ticket in the time it took to walk in to get a pass.,38,0,1444329047,1444725492
