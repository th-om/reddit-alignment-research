BROS.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most physically demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than our gainz.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the bench all to draw out a single extra drop of sweat.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: working through the pain, all day, the same weights over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we feel evety little detail such that some have attained such bro nirvana that they can literally do these workouts without protein powder.

Do these people have any idea how many weights have been smashed, bodies over heated, reps and squats destroyed in frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our weights? We're already building a new ones without them. They take our protein shakes? Bros aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the shakes our selves. They think calling us meatheads, jocks, steroid apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by muscled trainers with nothing better to do than yell at people working out. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Weight lifting is competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another bar to press.
