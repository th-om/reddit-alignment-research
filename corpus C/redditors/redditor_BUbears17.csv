cvxicun,1,t3_3ohu9d,BUbears17,"Liked the review but I have some issues with it:

> looks, feels, and plays just like battlefield...but it's star wars 

I highly disagree. I play a ton of BF4 and it's quite different

> Darth vader sounds like james earl jones

He does? I might need to watch the movies again but I don't think vader sounds that great at all

cvx8u8c,0,t1_cvx8fw6,BUbears17,Given how slow they are and how many vulnerabilities they have I get more kills as a ground troop per life than a hero. Sorely disappointed in the heroes IMO,1,0,1444677814,1444718902
cvx8m5o,1,t3_3ogwqw,BUbears17,"YESSSS. Hype mode increased to 11. 

To be honest I've been a bit disappointed in how weak the Heroes are in the beta (I only play them for ~1 minute then I'm dead) so I've been hoping for a hero v villain mode like in BF2. ",5,0,1444677488,1444718902
