cvrdvv0,0,t1_cvrcwf9,FlayOtters,"My daughter has been a godsend (and a devil, let's be honest.. she bounced back to her prepregnancy figure easily, and has a 20-year old's metabolism) with trying new things baking-wise.  She LOVES to bake, but of course I am not much one for wanting to replace all the bad food I love with keto-like food... unless she can come up with a keto friendly Boston Creme Donut, just.. just don't. ;o)  

And you're so right.  I'm 3 days ""clean"", and I already am starting to feel better, walk better.  I wish this feeling could be motivation enough for me to completely stay away from my trigger foods.. but this year has taught me that that is not the case.",2,0,1444233735,1444730114
