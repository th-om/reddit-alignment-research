In the Allegory, he seems to be saying almost the complete opposite, i.e., that the phenomenal world of human experience is the shadow cast in the dim absence of reason. Our senses are evil--they enslave us and rob us of knowledge and, thus, a chance of knowing ""the good"". Knowledge of the forms is the only true knowledge, which requires exiting the cave of phenomenal experience and discovering the forms under the light of reason, i.e., through practicing philosophy.",1,0,1444087715,1444726176

My basic point is irrefutable--basic income cannot solely be attributed to the far left. It's interesting that Paul Ryan and the supposed neo-conservative acolytes of the Austrian and Chicago schools of economics so conveniently leave out these ""far left"" ideas.

ct5dufi,0,t1_ct3r6kg,shartofwar,">In that light, objectivity would suggest that capitalism was the impetus for the elimination of the institution of slavery

First, nothing is ""objective"" about the temporal origins of capitalism. And someone like Fernand Braudel, who is known as the pre-eminent historian of capitalism for his *Civilization and Capitalism*, locates its origins in the 14th century, which puts your entire argument in a heap of trouble. As someone who stands opposed to the irrationality of idealized conceptions, I trust you'll sympathize with Braudel's complex history over and against Marx's schematic approach. 

It's also quite convenient that mention of what was required to eliminate slavery in America is absent from your narrative, that is, the occurrence of what was perhaps the most depraved and bloody civil war ever fought in World History. The Southern Oligarchy did not relinquish their property because they were enlightened by a ""free system of exchange"". It had to be wrenched from them by force. And had it not, slavery would've persisted until it was no longer required by capital for the smooth functioning of the agricultural system. Again, as I mentioned above, it was precisely because of *cheap labor*, as James Baldwin puts it, that American capitalism flourished and that it as a nation was launched onto the world's stage as an economic power worthy of competition with Europe. 

>Slavery was a constant fact of the human condition right up until 50-75 years after the advent of full capitalism.

This is just patently false. Every society on Earth prior to the advent of capitalism functioned on slave labor? Sorry, no. What of the entirety of Europe after Rome? And what is more, many of the societies which did require slavery for the maintenance of their economies saw rebellion just as America did. The ending of slavery has been repeated throughout history, always ending in rebellion--not in Enlightenment, just as American slavery did. The rebellion and overthrowing of slave owners is not unique to the advent of capitalism.

>The redefining of slavery that Marx et al. have undertaken in order to smear capitalism's success is akin to saying we shouldn't have roads because of car crashes or bandits.

This is a laughable (non)reading of Marx. Marx never smeared the products of capitalism. In fact, he lauds it's dynamism at many points of his writing. What he smeared was the internal mechanisms (the term *relations* of production ring a bell?) which produced the products--you know, that thing he's always on about? The *mode* of production, not *production* in itself. He takes issue with the *how* of production and what that mode of production means for those caught up in the relations of power which define it. To say that Marx was opposed to the human endeavor to produce roadways is patently absurd. He was opposed to a *relation* of power, as Foucault might put it.

>I replied elsewhere to the ""capitalism relies on slavery or something that resembles it"" 

My response regarding capitalism having it's origins in force and imposition was a response to your contention that capitalism is a ""system of free and voluntary exchange"". That is to say, capitalism can only be thought of as such if it is de-historicized. Capitalism is always imposed on an unwilling population from whom land is expropriated. 

>Plus you don't have to be a part of it if you don't like it as I mentioned. Start a community of like-minded people and live your vision.

Again, the experience of the Native American Indians, the Cubans, the Haitians, the Nicaraguans, the Guatemalans, etc., etc., etc. and on into oblivion, makes it explicit that this is not the case. One cannot walk away from capitalism--it's going to be imposed upon these populations by force, whether or not they like it. And not only will it be imposed, but the people on whom it will be imposed will be labeled as savage terrorists who're enemies to the national security of the hegemon and of the stability of the global order. 

The U.S. has not ceased in its attempt, since the Spanish-Cuban-American war at the end of the 19th century, to ensure the failure of every socialist movement ever to have sprung up in Latin America. Tell the Sandinistas they could've walked away from U.S. backed death squads--why should they have had to? Tell the Native Americans the same--but why should they have had to walk away from anything? 

>The fact that it's possible to not operate under a capitalistic model inside a capitalistic country makes the comparison to slavery untenable. 

Even Abraham Lincoln compared wage labor to chattel slavery. Again, this was an argument from slave owners--that wage labor was *actually worse* that slavery! And tons of people bought it! That's why Lincoln had to argue for the end of slavery within those parameters--because a large sect of the American population thought life as a wage laborer was pretty much equivalent to slavery! 

>But there is no ideal system. Idealism is the enemy of the rational.

It seems we agree here, but the obvious fact that no system is ideal is not in itself a justification for the status quo. 

>Plus you don't have to be a part of it if you don't like it as I mentioned. Start a community of like-minded people and live your vision. In a free market nobody will stop you.

Again, you have to deny at least a hundred and fifteen years of American Foreign Policy to even start to believe this. Not to mention, domestic history since the 20s in America.

>With democratic socialism, people will stop you from starting a free market enclave...so which is the more oppressive?

What?
