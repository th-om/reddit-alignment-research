It was so bad that I could barely say hi to someone new without having a full-blown panic attack. I had had the same group of friends for as long as I could remember, although by then I had very little in common with them and was only really friends with them out of fear of having no one else.

I had one friend I considered to be my only true friend, the one person I could open up to and relate to. I found out she went around telling people that I was a friendless loser and that she was only friends with me out of pity. That absolutely destroyed me, mostly because it just confirmed that my fears were true.",9,0,1443500679,1444729026

At my second conference, our club's president told us dressing up for crisis committee was ""highly encouraged."" My committee was a JCC on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. I was a member of the Mujahideen. I showed up in a full makeshift turban and beard, only to find out I was the only kid that showed up in costume. ",7,0,1440434592,1444729026
