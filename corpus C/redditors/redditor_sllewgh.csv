cvvx6e5,0,t1_cvvw0un,sllewgh,"Israel has only fought short term wars because it wins fast.  The Yom Kippur war featured Israel beating a coalition of all its neighbors in ~~six days~~ less than a month (got my wars confused), after they surprise attacked on the holiest day on the Jewish calendar- the jews were all fasting. They not only beat back the attack, they GAINED territory. Israeli intelligence had a running list of priority targets in the event of war, and because of rapid response strikes, most of the Egyptian air force never made it off the ground, *even though they started it with a surprise attack.*

North Korea actually sent 20 pilots to this conflict according to Wikipedia, so technically, Israel already has feats for beating NK. 

This is an absolute total stomp. I think Israel could win without NK ever actually launching any kind of attack. ",323,0,1444581635,1444718994

cvu37us,0,t1_cvu2jce,sllewgh,"> Of course I'm not listening to him ""only because he insulted"". That's ridiculous.

Then we agree that doing so is not fully necessary.  

Even if it was effective for you, it isn't for everyone.  A choice was made to prioritize hurling criticism over making an effective argument.  Anyone engaging this because of the tone is missing the point.  Anyone that doesn't should be able to recognize its inclusion as unnecessary.  In both cases it hurts the argument more than helps it.",1,0,1444421638,1444718994
cvu2xzc,0,t1_cvu24a5,sllewgh,"> My point is that what to you appears to be acting like a greedy pig may not actually be that. That is an observation you're making from the outside without firsthand knowledge.

Why am I unable to make that judgement simply because I'm on the outside?  When I see that Wal Mart actively lobbies for the right to pay their workers so little they require welfare assistance, I don't have to be an heir to that fortune to say that's greedy pig behavior.

It's totally untrue that an outsider can't judge.  It's the aim of whole multi-decade arcs of social science research in multiple fields.",1,0,1444421221,1444718994
