cvtpbxq,1,t3_3o3g1n,DevilYouKnow,"MVP is poorly defined. Some people use it to mean the most productive, dominant player in the league. Other people use it when describing the player that makes a good team great; the type of player that you cannot live without out.

Cam is not the best QB in the league but that doesn't mean we'd be 4-0 without him.",10,0,1444400641,1444726546
cvnrval,0,t1_cvnmi22,DevilYouKnow,"It's the flagship of the federation on a science mission with children aboad. That's true to who they are in part but mostly it's political. The Federation is telegraphing to the other powers, ""we're friendly intellectuals, not colonizers"".

As mentioned, by others, TNG was exploration of Federation space and uncharted (unclaimed) space. The vastness of space and the vagueness of location made this plausible.",3,0,1443968875,1444726546
cvmxgr1,0,t1_cvcvljz,DevilYouKnow,I think an interesting compromise would be to have the state legislature nominate candidates for the Senate seat (one for each party) and then the people vote for them.,1,0,1443894921,1444726546

cvd664d,0,t1_cvd4m97,DevilYouKnow,"fair point but important to note that Carolina ""represents"" two states with a combined population of more than double the state of Missouri. Carolina isn't exactly known for other sports (no baseball, only a few years of good hockey, minimal basketball success), so the Panthers have a good opportunity to dominate the market for years to come. The Rams have stiffer competition. I don't feel too bad for them.",4,0,1443137940,1444726546
cv6f71p,1,t3_3lh64n,DevilYouKnow,"Many people misunderstand the two party system. It's about stealing the most popular ideas. When an idea if popular, one party steals it. When it is really popular, both parties steal it. 

Third Parties can influence the direction of the country if they effectively sell their ideas.

Some Democrats have stolen more Libertarian ideas than others. But only the ""fringe"" Democrats steal the less popular ideas. Why? Because ""fringe"" ideas are unpopular ideas.",1,0,1442618650,1444726546
