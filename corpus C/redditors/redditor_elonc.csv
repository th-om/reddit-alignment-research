cvrgtir,0,t1_cvp85kp,elonc,"> especially with this group's pretty limited knowledge about walkers.

this to me is the reason why we should have seen their first time reactions to a horde of dead pouring out of a stadium in mass ",3,0,1444238036,1444729188

cvp0brl,0,t1_cvozebw,elonc,"i get that, but that is kind of a big moment for the characters dont you think? That should have been part of the show and not an implication",1,0,1444060816,1444729188
cvox57y,1,t3_3na10i,elonc,"i wanted to see more the government and social systems collaspe. Instead we sit in a house, in a neighborhood for 4 episodes then run from a horde of walkers. Seems familiar right? Imagine camping out on a farm, at a farm house for an entire season and then run away from a horde of zombies at the finale. FTWD = season 2 of TWD",1,0,1444055194,1444729188

cvox0ce,1,t3_3njmsa,elonc,"Did it bother anyone else that the writers completely left out the part where the group opens the stadium doors? Salazar walking casually in front of the guards with a horde of zombies behind him... wtf?? The show lost me there, i even had to rewind to see if i missed something. We go from leaving the neighborhood to hanging out with thousands of dead walkers like its an everyday event. I really think the writers should have shown us the moment when the characters first saw that many zombies at once. Before that we only saw maybe one at a time. Also opening that door to the stadium would have been seriously fucking dangerous. Weak ass writing along with this episode being rushed. How does a group of average citizens infiltrate a military compound and none of them gets killed. Liza gets bit or scratched but when the fuck did that happen? I dont remember her coming in close contact with any walkers. I like the show but the writing really bothers me here. It is half assed..",2,0,1444054946,1444729188

cvh351e,1,t3_3mo7kn,elonc,i like the idea of TWD in the fall winter and FTWD in the early summer to fall season.,1,0,1443461706,1444729188
