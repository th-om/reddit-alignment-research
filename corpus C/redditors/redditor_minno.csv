> #What if I pled guilty, no contest, or was convicted at trial?

> A no contest plea has the same impact as a guilty plea on your Texas criminal history. Any case that resulted in a **conviction**, whether by plea or trial, is **not eligible for expunction or non-disclosure** unless you are one of those rare and lucky souls who was pardoned by the governor. Governor Perryâ€™s office was notoriously stingy with pardons, even those approved by the Board of Pardons and Parole.
