4. Saying she handed over her emails because of routine procedures from state to collect from previous secretaries, was a lie. State just released that she had been stalling since 2014. 

They wanted them because of the investigation, not because it's procedural. 

It began with her breaking the law, she is getting what she deserves. ",-4,0,1443251056,1444723531
