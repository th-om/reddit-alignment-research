cvxvu6e,1,t3_3oggov,NihiloZero,"Why do you consider yourself a lefty or a liberal?  I didn't see much in your post to back up that idea.  Nor do I understand how a liberal/lefty/progressive would oppose steeper progressive taxation and minimized tuition costs.  

It also seems that everyone ignores the elephant in the room... even top military brass says that the military budget is bloated and wasteful.  If you reduced that and the prison-industrial complex... you'll have a lot more money to use for other things.   ",1,1,1444716145,1444726716

cvxt9pa,0,t1_cvxlzh1,NihiloZero,">  I think he's already fallen for the trap by holing up there. He's probably not in any real legal jeopardy; they're playing on his paranoia.

It's pretty easy to speculate about such things when it's not your ass on the line.  Assange is a smart guy and probably knows the score much better than you or I.  And while his hair may have turned white because of some of the crazy shit he's seen... I don't think he's excessively paranoid.  To me, such accusations just sound like more of the same denigrating propaganda that typically gets leveled at him.",2,0,1444709760,1444726716

This first one is most disturbing:

Combine that with factors like this:

And you end up with children with different habits and health conditions based upon where they are born, when, and what cultural trends are currently manifesting.  Mind you... the factors I've linked to don't necessarily have anything to do with the amount of sunlight mothers receive during pregnancy.
