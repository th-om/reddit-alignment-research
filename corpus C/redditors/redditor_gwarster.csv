cvtvywg,0,t1_cvtue7o,gwarster,"Well for me, the issue is that with snap dragons, you can't use iceberg lettuce.  Also, snap dragons need to be at the front of your lawn due to their limited range, so you *must* kill the first zombie quickly which starts the next couple of waves.

Instead, I'll typically lay down sunshrooms in column three while stalling the first zombie with iceberg lettuce and laying stalia on other rightward tiles.  Then a  row of homing-thistle in the second row with spike weed in the 9th column.  Depending on the level, I will then fill in the first column with either laser beans or winter-melons.  Everything else gets filled with sunshrooms.",2,0,1444410802,1444723915

cvt0f6a,0,t1_cvszqa3,gwarster,"In Minnesota, our most recent voter ID ballot initiative failed.  Most people here don't want it.

And a college student does not need an ID to be considered a resident.  You also don't need to change your ID to be considered a resident.

Accessibility for an ID is an issue.  I work with disabled people every day who do not have access to an ID.  And none of your most recent comment addresses my previous point:

>I would 100% agree that requiring an ID would be a good idea if there was a problem with in-person voter fraud, but there isn't. There have been so few cases that it is statistically non-existent. And while requiring an ID may not disenfranchise a large portion of the population, it would definitely shut more eligible voters out than it would prevent in fraudulent votes.

Also, please don't downvote me just because I disagree with you.  Its childish.",0,0,1444342040,1444723915
