cvxtpj5,1,t3_3oipmc,securitywyrm,And only 12 more Mondays until the first patch that makes the game playable.,1,0,1444710676,1444717870
cvxrifv,1,t3_3ml1qt,securitywyrm,"It's like Doom 3. ""Oh, you can't hold a weapon and a flashlight at the same time, ATMOSPHERE!"" Game was borderline unplayable until I installed a mod that literally duct-tapes the flashlight to the end of your gun.",1,1,1444706529,1444717870
cvxrfln,1,t3_3nupr9,securitywyrm,"I don't, because games are rarely of final quality when first released. For example, I'm excited about Fallout 4 but I'll wait a month after it comes out to play it because I know there will be a staggering number of performance patches in that first month.",1,1,1444706387,1444717870
cvxre5m,0,t1_cvt1be8,securitywyrm,"And if it's a long walkthrough, having a title screen with links to various points in the video, like ""First boss, Second boss, temple sliding puzzle"" etc.",1,1,1444706318,1444717870
cvxr7mb,1,t3_3o1237,securitywyrm,"I've watched a lot of walkthroughs for Minecraft for how to build things, and I have some serious pet peeves. 

1. Emphasizing what you're looking at by shaking the mouse.
2. Unedited footage. Doing everything in one long take.
3. Lack of setup. If you want to show how to build something, build it and then start the video, and go through it layer by layer. Not ""Hey let's build a..."" because that's more gameplay than walkthrough.
4. We don't need a tour of your base to see how to craft something.
5. If you're out of breath doing a video game walkthrough, get off the computer and GO OUTSIDE!",1,1,1444706011,1444717870
cvxr433,1,t3_3o3n61,securitywyrm,"I watched a few videos of people playing the game, and there's one thing I did not see: people having fun. Just lots of serious expressions and frustrations from ""I don't know what killed me"" or ""There is no way I could have avoided that."" The question becomes: what does this game offer that Call of Duty doesn't?",1,1,1444705856,1444717870
cvxqzpl,0,t1_cvwszaz,securitywyrm,"I'm picturing a cooking minigame, where you can get significant stat boosts from properly combining ingredients.",1,1,1444705665,1444717870
cvxqyjv,0,t1_cvwl67c,securitywyrm,"I think a bonus is a better way to go than a penalty. When eating and drinking just remove penalties, you get something like Fallout: New Vegas, where it's just ""Ding, you are now thirsty, please open the inventory and click the bottled water to remove this stat penalty."" It doesn't add anything.",1,1,1444705612,1444717870
cvxqw4z,1,t3_3oegql,securitywyrm,"I have a good example: Fallout New Vegas. The ""hardcore mode"" that it came with was a joke. You had to eat, sleep and drink, but these were just expressed as penalties. You'd be walking down the road and your agility would drop by 1 and you'd have an icon on your HUD indicating that you were thirsty. That was the extent of the depth of the system: making you occasionally go into your inventory and push a button to remove a stat penalty.

And yet that system was made incredibly immersive by a mod that did something simple: it added sound effects. As your character began to get thirsty, you'd cough and smack your lips. Getting hungry? Stomach rumble. Sleepy? Yawn and sign. Just simple unobtrusive noises. I found myself reaching for my water in real life when my character would cough; that was some damn good immersion. At that point it was part of the ""experience"" instead of ""Please push button to remove stat penalty.""

A question game developers need to ask is: Will an eat/sleep/drink requirement benefit the game? I went through all of Skyrim without eating or drinking and never felt ""this isn't realistic that I've been awake for 300 hours and never drunk anything other than potions.""
