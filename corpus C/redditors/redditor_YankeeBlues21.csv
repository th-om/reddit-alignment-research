cvnkr45,0,t1_cvni6qz,YankeeBlues21,"I mean it in broad terms. Obviously thers's a place for some regulations but so many of them just add to the already enormous government bureaucracy. 

For example, (and I touched on this with the Uber reference) I think it's absurd to have laws mandating things like special certifications to cut hair or drive a cab. If someone is running a bad barber shop or cab company or has a bad employee people will stop using their service until they straighten up. And if not, it's a company that deserves to either go under or change ownership. While these may have been established with good intentions, today they really only serve as a high barrier to entry for competitors into these markets. I mean, to use Uber again, they seem to have completely dominated the taxi companies everywhere they operate, because they've had incentive to innovate while cabs were, for decades, the only game in town, and so they became complacent and let their service and utilities decline. Meanwhile, here's Uber replacing a pricey certification system with peer review via social media. Cabbies start out thousands of dollars in the hole after paying for their cab and certification. Cabs never stood a chance...

To give a specific example (and lengthy...sorry, got carried away...) of a regulation I'm not particularly fond of is how expansive the FDA is regarding pharmaceuticals (hear me out for a second). Obviously companies shouldn't just be able to throw garbage in a bottle and call it medicine, but the current process is a major reason why the cost of healthcare has gotten so high in the US. From preclinical trials to becoming available to the market it can take, at best, something like 5 years, and as many as 20, (an average of about 12 years) for a new medication to pass the FDA mandated process. This costs companies hundreds of millions of dollars (avg. $350 mil) during that period. I'm not advocating totally *eliminating* the FDA or anything (or EPA, ""oops..."") but, and I'm spitballing here, wouldn't it be within reason to have a more expedited procedure (say, just to make sure a drug is not doing drastic harm before releasing it on a limited basis to willing patients, like video game beta testing), set up a website (not run by the folks behind healthcare.gov) that keeps data on the efficacy of the medication currently available to the public allowing patients to research which are the best/cheapest/etc and which are covered under which insurance plans, and keep doctors up to date about the most recent developments regarding any potential safety risks (like allergies the prescription may aggravate)? (Holy half-paragraph sentence Batman!) As part of a larger effort to let people take a more active share in ""shopping"" for the best options in care (like having prices of medicine and procedures reported prior to service, except life-threatening situations of course) having a nationally available and popular database of medicine would help reduce the ""failure to warn liability"" which is another part of the regulations that accounts for huge costs to manufacturers. Consumers would be kept up to date on the warnings through the government medical database and be able to make more informed health choices while drug companies wouldn't fear lawsuits as much, allowing them to charge less for their products. Basically what I'm saying in this example is that the FDA's requirements and rules are so costly that pharmaceutical manufacturers are basically forced to pass those costs on to us when we consume the product (often over a decade after it was created, meaning we could have had our hands on a useful medicine years earlier and helped a lot of people that may have been willing to risk side effects if they were given the option as long as the risks were made available to them prior to treatment). As a side note on costs, it certainly doesn't help us that many other countries have weaker patent rights, which is another incentive for drug creators to charge what they can here, while they have sole rights to their creation. So free trade agreements with other countries requiring our patents to be recognized would, I imagine, also be beneficial to our prices of care rather than more protectionist trade policies that risk angering those countries and making them less likely to, among other things, want to acknowledge American drug patents (not to mention the increased incentive to innovate that more globalized patent laws would give to drug makers). 

Now, I went on a bit of a tangent there (healthcare became a bit of an interest of mine a couple years ago) but to answer your specific question, yeah I would probably prefer a state agency to have the primary role in setting standards. If the federal EPA sets something like, say, an emission standard, they may set a specific level of CO2 that people in a state like Oregon think is great (or even too lenient) but is nearly crippling to a state like West Virginia. I mean, in a perfect world we'd be on guaranteed-to-be-safe nuclear (personally, I think nuclear is safe as long as people aren't careless, but nothing in life is certain) tomorrow, but we all know that won't happen. Fossil fuels will probably be the primary energy source for most (if not all) of my life (I'm in my 20s) so we can't try to shift gears immediately. If one state can switch to nuclear and hydro without killing its economy, then wonderful, more power to them! From a worldwide level it's a similar story, the US or UK or wherever can regulate its own consumption, but that isn't in the best interests of a rapidly-developing country like China or India and so it would honestly only handicap American business while not doing much to meet the regulator's environmental goal. Eventually, a private sector entity will develop energy sources for transportation and power that is at least as cheap, efficient, and available as oil or natural gas and that will begin the transition. Until then, environmental standards should be fairly localized, as those governments likely understand their own economies better than an agency in DC. 

I think, when it comes down to it, a lot of people would agree that the bureaucracy has gotten too large and unwieldy and the number of regulations too high, but nothing is done about it because no politician wants to be the guy responsible for laying off a couple hundred government employees cause it'll come back to bite them during election season, nor does he want campaign ads saying he's against things with names like the ""Clean Air"" Act, even if he did so because he would prefer a ""Wyoming"" Clean Air act that's uniquely tailored to his state.",2,0,1443942816,1444720127
cvmaert,0,t1_cvm9zzz,YankeeBlues21,Anytime. I'm always happy to talk with people I disagree with. We're not going to change each other's mind but not being able to have discussions between people with different opinions is a big reason why there's so much polarization in politics today. It's too easy to just write off the other side as dumb or evil and forget that there's probably a good reason they hold their beliefs. ,3,0,1443830855,1444720127
cvm9xww,1,t3_3na21e,YankeeBlues21,"First off, I wanted to say thanks for taking a chance to get some opinions on opposing views instead of writing off essentially half the country. I'm a registered independent, but I vote Republican way more often than not and identify as somewhere between a conservative and a libertarian. This isn't close to my full philosophy but just some beliefs off the top of my head.

I think that regulations do more harm to commerce than good (and hopefully Uber being chased out of cities will help convince some of my fellow Millennials of that) and I'm a fan of the free market. Capitalism has brought more people out of poverty than any alternative. I like low taxes and think the purpose of taxation is just to keep the gov't functioning, not to reallocate wealth or ensure fair outcomes. At the same time, I'm a practicing Catholic and so obviously hate to see people suffering, but I just don't think government is the solution. Caring for our neighbor is something that falls on each of us individually but shouldn't be coerced through the power of the government. If the gov't wants to facilitate charity by providing incentives to people who run them, that's wonderful. Also, the anti-wealth/success and anti-personal responsibility rhetoric of the Democratic party has gotten to ridiculous levels.  

I believe in a smaller, limited federal government that doesn't make sweeping laws effecting places as wildly different as (for example) California and Alabama. I'm probably a social moderate. I'm good with gay marriage and decriminalizing pot (not a ""fan"" of legalizing, but wouldn't be against it either). I'm pro-life but don't know of any realistic legislation I'd advocate for and abortion is just a political quagmire (neither side will convince the other whether the fetus is or isn't a baby). I'd be okay with a ban at some point (20 weeks is the number thrown around) and no taxes to organizations that provide them. I'm generally exacerbated by the hardline stances the evangelical wing of the party takes, especially when they don't show up for a moderate candidate. 

I'm disenchanted with the party because I feel like both of the major parties are two sides of the same coin. They'll parade their ideals and take stands when they aren't in a position to make a decision, but when they're in office it's the same sort of big government policies and bills filled with extra spending come re-election season.

Did you mean can we see ourselves voting for any of the ""Democrats"" running for President? Cause I feel like it's a bit odd to ask Republicans whether they'd vote for a Republican for president. I can't speak for everyone, but I'd probably vote for any GOP nominee over the Dem alternative (except like probably Webb over Trump). But my preferred candidates are Rubio, Kasich and Rand. (I know that's a broad  spectrum, but I'm not going to agree with anyone on everything so I pick guys I agree with on many things and think would do a decent job). ",21,0,1443829909,1444720127

cuzlcch,1,t3_3kob1w,YankeeBlues21,"2011, the first year of my fantasy career, I made it to the championship (played in week 17) and had Aaron Rodgers at QB all season. But Rodgers was sitting week 17 because the Packers were like 14-1. I picked up Tim Tebow to play at QB. Rodgers' backup, Matt Flynn, goes off for 6 TDs while Tebow had like -3 points. I lost by 7. Almost any other starting QB on waivers could have given me more than 4 points. ",1,0,1442108388,1444720127
cumufxq,1,t3_3j6yoo,YankeeBlues21,"I have a couple tips that have helped me over the years (5th year commissioning my 12-team league, finished top-3 every year):

I do at least a few mocks from each third of the draft spots and develop a general outline/strategy for each third. In other words, a few mocks with early picks (1-4), middle (5-8), & late (9-12). The separations are sorta arbitrary, but they're decent enough approximations of the sorts of players that will be available/highly ranked when you pick each round (the teams I make from the 1st pick tend to resemble the ones from the 3rd pick, but look quite difference than the ones from the 6th or 10th). 

Then I make a sort of depth chart for each third and list like 3-5 players that I like that are available more often than not in each round. I try to diversify the positions I like in each round, but if there happens to be a round where, of the, say 4 players I like, 3 or 4 are WRs, then I sort of pencil in that round as a WR round and plan the others accordingly.  For instance, in the early and mid 3rd I really like Cooks, Matthews,  Evans, Hopkins, and Gore, and since 4 of those 5 are WRs, I'll assume I'm probably taking a WR in the 3rd (especially since there's a chance I went RB/RB with an early pick taking a top-5 RB in the 1st and someone like Forsett or Miller in the late 2nd).

If your league is anything like mine, this strategy is most useful for the first 100 or so picks when the draft goes fairly by the rankings (not exactly, but no ones is really reaching entire rounds except maybe someone at the bookend picks). After the 8th round or so however, people tend to start deviating, and guys like Anquan Boldin (low ceiling, bye week fill-in guys) will sit undrafted for a few rounds while people go after specific targets they've already designated as sleepers or other bench players they want (like handcuffs), so the 9th-16th rounds of my mocks and real drafts tend to look pretty similar regardless of where in the order I'm picking since I'm targeting guys I like (like David Johnson, Eli, Delanie Walker, etc.). So I'd find some names in the latter half of the draft that you're high on and list them out as bench/lottery tickets.

It's definitely becoming more mainstream, but in case you're used to smaller leagues I'll go ahead and say wait on a QB (unless Luck or Rodgers falls to the point where they become a good value pick, like into the 3rd). Unlike smaller leagues, almost everyone will have a somewhat flawed QB  and you'll be able to get someone in the 8th-11th rounds that you can absolutely live with starting every week (I've been targeting Romo/Eli/Tannnehill/Rivers in that range) and you'll have built up a really good stable of RB/WRs while your opponents took QBs in the middle rounds. Same goes for TEs. Wait unless Gronk or Graham fall below their adp, otherwise grab someone like Walker, Eifert, etc that may break out, or be droppable when someone better comes along.

I touched on this in the paragraph above, but for at least the first 7 or 8 rounds I usually pick nothing but RBs and WRs. That way you'll have a solid group of at least 2-3 starting caliber guys and a quality backup or two at each position. You'll be able to weather injuries if they come up, and if not, you'll have great depth to work out trades later in the year if necessary. Loading up on RBs also allows you to take some more high-risk/reward options like drafting Foster or Doug Martin, guys who, at their adp (around the 5th in a 12 team) could win you the championship if they return RB1/high-end RB2 value. 

Lastly, don't get too cute early on. A lot of success in a bigger league is just making the playoffs (since luck is a huge factor once you're there....trust me, I've made and lost 3 straight championship games) and a big part of making the playoffs is drafting a fairly safe, reliable core. If I'm picking, say 2nd, maybe I take the almost guaranteed top-5 finish from Eddie Lacy over the 0-2 hole I may end up in with Leveon Bell, even though Bell probably has the better chance of being the top RB after his suspension. Or if I'm picking at the end of the 1st, maybe I'll grab two elite WRs like Dez and Julio rather than roll the dice on Murray, Forte or McCoy. I can always get a couple RBs in rounds 3-6 that can be solid contributors (like Gore, Latavius, and Yeldon maybe?). 

Anyway, this was way longer than intended, but hopefully you found at least some of it helpful. Good luck this season!",2,0,1441098116,1444720127

cujd5w7,0,t1_cuj26lb,YankeeBlues21,"I guess much of the weight of each accomplishment is subjective as I imagine we have pretty opposing views of Hillary, but I just wanted to respond.

I don't know why fairness has to enter into it, Bush Sr. was the youngest pilot in the navy at one point. That's extremely impressive and an accolade he has that she doesn't. You were willing to count his wealthier background against him, which he had as much control over as Hillary did her armed forces eligibility. 

I feel like CIA director AND UN ambassador (AND envoy to China, which I didn't know until checking his wiki page) outweigh Sec of State. That's 3 separate appointments (and who knows what the CIA job involves...). 

The J.D. is great, but I'd say what a candidate does after their degree is what's really important. If your degree level should factor significantly into the presidency, then Ben Carson is the next president. Hillary got a degree in law (and poli sci in undergrad) which is obviously pertinent to governance, but Bush's degree is in economics which is pretty relevant too and both were able to use their degrees to have successful careers.

You mention the difference in years they've been in politics, but Bush held elected or appointed offices for those 3 decades (and was successful in the private sector before that, not just sitting around) while, and I don't want to disparage her role here, but for the better part of two decades Hillary's political position was being married to Bill Clinton. Granted she was his Claire Underwood and a huge part of his successes, but First Lady (and First Lady of Arkansas prior to that) doesn't really compare to CIA Director. To be fair though she also saw success in the private sector and law during this period (and like the poster above said, she was very involved as FL). 

Then there's still the 2-term sitting VP point (which I think will hurt Hillary if/when Biden jumps into the race since Biden's Obama's heir apparent).

I'm not even a big fan of Bush Sr. I just picked him because he's a fairly recent candidate/president and he's a solid example to contest a sweeping statement like ""Hillary is the most qualified person to run for president, possibly ever"". Her resume is impressive, no doubt, but when you're running for the top job, virtually everyone has a resume that's at least somewhat formidable. Plenty of the people to hold that office have had immensely important lives before being elected (Eisenhower, Teddy, Grant, pretty much all the Founders just to name a handful). And I don't think anyone really knows whether they're ""qualified"" until they actually sit in the Oval Office (though VPs, first ladies, and cabinet members probably have as good an idea as anyone). 

Anyway, this post ended up being longer than I intended and I know we won't change each other's minds, but you've made some good points and this gave me the chance to read a bit more into two major figures in recent history so thanks for the debate!",2,0,1440815587,1444720127
