cvt1jei,0,t1_cvt0c8l,druuconian,"No, objectively Obama 2008 > Hillary 2008.  Sanders has never enjoyed anywhere close to Obama's level of political success and he wasn't running in '08.

I fully concede that Hillary isn't the best politician out there.  But she has formidable advantages over Sanders that she didn't have over Obama, chief among them being the ""historic first"" factor, which Obama also had and Sanders does not.  Sanders has also not built anywhere close to the juggernaut organization that Obama managed to in '08.",1,0,1444343874,1444731976
cvsyzcw,0,t1_cvsyer4,druuconian,"> I still don't get what this means. Being an excellent politician is subjective, and therefore not a fact. 

No, being an excellent politician can be objectively judged by the results of said politician.  The biggest metric is electoral success.  It is not reasonable to say that someone is an excellent politician if they lose their election, while it is quite reasonable to say that someone is an excellent politician if they have an unbroken string of wins (particularly one that starts in the state senate and ends in the White House within a decade).

> Speaker/Organizer/whatever about his personality sure. His stances on issues are not factually proven to be anything. No viewpoints in politics are.

I'm not talking about his stances on issues--for the purposes of determining whether or not he is a good politician, that is irrelevant.  His success speaks for itself, whether or not you agree with the policies he pursues.

> The fuck this have to do with anything?

It has to do with his success as a politician.  Obama had pretty much zero foreign policy experience and still managed to get elected in the middle of two wars.  That's not an easy thing, especially when he was running against McCain who had quite a bit of gravitas on foreign policy.  

> I get that you have wet dreams about Obama

Not at all, I just recognize that he's very good at getting himself elected.

> We're essentially just going back and forth on the same shit now, so if you really want to pencil in Hillary already that's on you. 

Yeah, I think the smart money is on Hillary.  Bernie Sanders obviously does not possess Barack Obama's political skills.  Every objective polling measure tells you that.",1,0,1444339808,1444731976

cvsi60g,1,t3_3nz5mq,druuconian,"The answer is no, for several reasons:

1)  Drug testing is very expensive and experience tells us that it catches very few people.  So if we're going to have a welfare system, it's more cost effective not to test.

2) Drug testing tends to work against people using relatively harmless drugs like marijuana (as it stays in your system for a long time) while excusing people using hard drugs like meth or cocaine (which is out of your system relatively quickly and won't show up on a test).  That makes very little sense to me as plenty of people who smoke weed can still be productive members of society.

3) Drug testing increases the power of the state.  Even if we're against welfare policies, that doesn't mean we should applaud efforts by the government to exert more control over citizens' lives.  IMO that principle doesn't go out the window when we're talking about welfare recipients.",19,0,1444315090,1444731976
cvshylx,0,t1_cvs0xe7,druuconian,"> Then why was Hilary destroying him in polls up until the last few months?

Name ID.  The thing about Barack Obama is he had huge upward potential because of (a) a compelling personal story, (b) serious love from the rank and file of the party, and (c) excellent oratorical skills.  Bernie Sanders has none of those things.

> I assume you mean he's a phenomenal speaker.

His speaking abilities are certainly a big part of his political skill.  His organizing abilities I would argue are at least equally as important.

But the bottom line is that nobody goes from state senator to POTUS in 10 years without some very serious political skills.  Whatever you think about Obama's policies, it's a stone cold fact that he's an excellent politician.  

> and Obama wasn't?

No, he wasn't.  Illinois is not a small state.

> He was criticized in '08 for a lack of a strong enough political background by many. 

Sure, but it says something about the guy that he managed to overcome his thin resume and get elected as commander in chief while we were in the middle of two wars.  If nothing else that's further evidence of his once-in-a-generation political skill.

> Overall the only thing I got out of your comment that I think you have a point on is that Obama is a good speaker and is more persuasive than Sandes

It's not just that Obama is a better speaker.  When we're talking overall political talent, it's the difference between the major and the minor leagues.  It's the difference between the Rolling Stones and your local cover band.  

Sanders is a very liberal senator who has managed to get elected in a small, homogeneous, mostly white, very liberal state.  He has pretty much zero legislative accomplishments to speak of.  He's not a particularly compelling speaker.  He can barely keep his hair combed.  All of that tells me that he doesn't have what it takes to go the distance and beat the Clinton operation, which is *far* more formidable now in terms of organization than it was in 2008 (seeing as how she hired pretty much all of the key people responsible for Obama's 2008 victory).
