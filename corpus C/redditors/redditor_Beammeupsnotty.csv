cvum76h,1,t3_3o5gpf,Beammeupsnotty,"I hate ads like this. The false earnestness and syrupy sincerity leading to the anticlimax when they reveal whatever trivial thing they are selling.


It's just like those car adverts where they try to sell you a better life in a better world for 5 minutes then suddenly reveal that what they are actually selling is a new version of the same old car (but this time with leather seats and available in 3 new colours!)",67,0,1444463398,1444719765
