cvxq0uk,0,t1_cvxh88h,Swordsknight12,It will be interesting to see how Revis matches up with them. He stated in previous interviews that he had his own tricks for covering Gronk. ,1,0,1444704090,1444731950
cvwyn5n,1,t3_3og5o0,Swordsknight12,"I swear to God if we lose to the Bengals in the playoffs I'm gonna flip shit. Can understand losing to the Giants, Colts, or Broncos, but not them.

Evidently I'm getting downvoted for this so let me explain. The Colts are a team that will be very tough to beat years from now. I think that this season they got off to a really bad start but I wouldn't overreact to it. The Defense needs serious improvements and the blatant disregard for the team not seriously addressing those reasons in the offseason was dumb. 

The reason I think the Bengals are pretenders is due to their QB. Dalton has failed in the postseason when it matters. He clearly has been performing well above his own line but he needs to really prove to me that he is more than just a 1 and done QB in the playoffs.",-11,0,1444662364,1444731950

ITT: People who have no idea how corporations are taxed

EDIT: Since people asking me to explain:

 * if US company provides a service to UK customers, it will be taxed in US
 * big companies have many subsidiaries (companies they control) and can optimize the way money is routed by asking customers to work with a specific subsidiary
 * corporation tax is usually a tax on corporation's profits; if company isn't profitable, it (usually) pays no profit tax , but it will pay other taxes
 * usually subsidiaries are opened for specific purposes, e.g. it might be just a developer shop; such a company won't be ever profitable it will spend all of its revenue on developer salaries and offices
 * but the government will also receive a big chunk of its revenue via payroll/salary/income taxes, also, possibly VAT. 

(People need to educate themselves on this subject instead of overreacting. I think Corporations should be paying more taxes but let's not ignore the consequences of eliminating certain loopholes and how that affects consumers and employees.)",1,0,1444661282,1444731950
cvwjfrg,0,t1_cvwj9gb,Swordsknight12,Well yes I think less should be spent on the military and more toward domestic activities but saying that defending the nation or helping to defend trade partners doesn't produce anything positive is a bit misleading.,1,0,1444618833,1444731950
cvwjaz6,0,t1_cvwfely,Swordsknight12,"Truthfully after reading it I'm still not convinced they produce more long term jobs as opposed to those that you would see from the private sector. For example, repairing a bridge doesn't bring any extra economic value to the region since it doesn't transform inputs into outputs. A new business is an input-output system so it creates additional value to society as well as employing people for existing. Again I'm not saying there is no economic benefit from repairing or creating infrastructure but it's not as rich in value as opposed to a new business being created.",1,0,1444618595,1444731950

cvwdto4,1,t3_3ocdqh,Swordsknight12,"13 million temporary jobs. Keynesian 101 with him. Nobody is arguing that repairing roads and bridges isn't a good investment. But his idea is to tax and then spend which just contradicts the economic gains, let alone how temporary the multiplier is. He never thinks his policies through. Always about the populist buzz words with no long term thinking. Just enough to get votes.",17,0,1444608657,1444731950
