There are too many variables: you could hit an artery, you could hit a bystander, you could miss your intended target and hit a lethal area, the person might have complications, etc.

The only gunshot wound that is 100% survivable is the one that is never inflicted. There is a reason that military training stresses that you should never point a gun a someone you do not mean to kill. Shooting someone doesn't necessarily mean that you will kill them, but you shouldn't fire at someone unless that is accepted outcome.",9,0,1444251845,1444731194

State laws may not trump Federal laws or the Constitution. As a result the Kentucky law was struck down. It no longer exists. As a result, Ms. Davis must uphold the post-*Obergefell* definition of marriage in Kentucky.

> This is arguably not true as a marriage is defined as 1 man 1 woman in Kentucky law and that is not being denied to anyone.

Actually, it is. In order to counter claims of discrimination, Ms. Davis began refusing to issue any marriage licenses.",3,0,1442010360,1444731194
cuyeyhz,0,t1_cuyb6il,kelthan,"In order for the Constitutional right of free expression of religion to be preserved, it must also require protection from the religious expression of others. Without that, everyone could claim religious expression as a defense for abridging the rights of others.

Simply stated: ""You can believe anything you want, but you must not force anyone else to act according to your beliefs.""

For example, someone could claim that working on the Sabbath is against their religion. They can hold that belief and act upon it personally, but they may not use that belief to prevent you from working, or going out on a date, or going to a club with your friends on the Sabbath. .

The only way to arbitrate those in court without instilling religious preferences into law is to adopt a doctrine that all religions are equal in the eyes of the law. This requires that an individual's rights to their religious beliefs must not be infringed, but equally, that those views  must not infringe on anyone else's constitutional rights. In the event of a conflict between the two, the latter must win in order to prevent religious persecution.

Kim Davis crossed the line of the Constitution when she began imposing her religious beliefs on the legal actions of others, specifically when she stopped issuing marriage licenses to those legally qualified to get married, and even more egregiously when she prevented others in her office from issuing licenses.

In the second case Ms. Davis used her position of power to not only infringed the rights of the marriage petitioners, she infringed the rights of the deputy clerks, as well as requiring the clerks to break the law, all based on her religious views.

How is that not religious persecution?",17,0,1442009633,1444731194

But the most likely factor was disease: the Spanish brought over Smallpox which [quickly wiped out huge portions of the population](http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html).

Estimates are that about 20 million people--95% of of the Aztec and Inca population--were wiped out within 20 years of the Spanish invasion of Central and South America. Warfare alone would not account for that many deaths due to logistical constraints. Pizzaro's initial expedition in 1532 consisted of only 168 soldiers, augmented by [native allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_auxiliaries). A force that small would have ultimately been overwhelmed by attrition given the size and breadth of the Incan empire despite their superior weaponry, armor, and mobility.

Smallpox may also have triggered the Incan civil war. An infected slave travelling from Cuba in 1520 may have brought the disease to Mexico, killing the Incan Emperor Huayna Capac. Two of his sons, the legitimate prince, TÃºpac Cusi Hualpa and a bastard son Atahualpa, [both claimed the throne](http://www.spanishwars.net/16th-century-conquest-inca-empire.html). The conflict culminated in a civil war, which Atahualpa ultimately won, but which left the empire divided and weakened, just as the Spaniards show up.",0,0,1440182993,1444731194
