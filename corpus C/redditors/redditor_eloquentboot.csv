I just started betting, but I don't want to risk any real money until I get a good feel for what I'm doing, so I'm using sportsplays.com which doesn't make you risk your own money. Thanks for the information on Wong teasers, I looked it up, and it's just the sort of information that I wanted to get. Thank you for the information.",2,0,1444604177,1444719379

cvvvodr,1,t3_3obt0g,eloquentboot,"I've been doing a lot of teasers recently and have been pretty successful. But I was wondering if teasers are sort of a fools gold game where the odds are pretty shitty. For reference, yesterday I did a 5 team +9 teaser (+120), where I took:

Penn State: +1

Boise State: -7

LSU: -4.5 (I made this bet on tuesday, so I got great odds for LSU)

Michigan State: -5 (I got pretty damn lucky on this game)

Minnesota: +6

So while I won, I was wondering if this is smart to do consistently?",2,0,1444578883,1444719379

cvqkell,0,t1_cvqj8af,eloquentboot,">The Republican party is fractured right now. It is difficult to define a single coherent philosophy.

This has been the case since its infancy. It started as an anti slave party, but basically didn't agree on anything else. They were staunchly divided on the idea of income tax, raising tariffs, and after the civil war how to handle reconstruction. 

In the late 1800s, they split into factions called the Stalwarts and the Mugwumps. The division led to the biggest split probably in their history, as most of the ""Mugwumps"" went on to support democratic candidates. This is arguably the point in history that the republicans started to identify as more conservative (though there still was a progressive faction). 

I could go through all of history and do this, but it's not that interesting. But there have always been splits, today it's the evangelicals, versus the moderates versus the libertarians. In the 1960s, it was the Nixon faction (basically the moderate faction), the Goldwater faction (basically the libertarians), and the Eisenhower faction (basically a liberal faction). The republican party likely won't become ideologically homogeneous ever, partly because conservative is such an incredibly broad description of their values.",3,0,1444166865,1444719379
cvqjwg3,0,t1_cvqjp81,eloquentboot,"Lol, I'm not sure exactly what you want. To put in plain terms, Ohio is not a must win for republicans in the primaries, and in all reality neither is New Hampshire. New Hampshire however will be far more important to them than almost all other states. Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina almost always set the tone for the primaries, so they will be the state that candidates exert the most focus in.",1,0,1444166088,1444719379

That's a pretty good indicator of New Hampshire's politics. New Hampshire has a surprising strong identity. It places emphasis on states rights, and is in favor of low taxes. New Hampshire doesn't have a sales tax, or an income tax. Most of its revenue is raised through property rights, which is something that appeals to both the rich and the poor. Historically, they have supported fairly moderate candidates in the republican primaries who place an emphasis on states rights and lowering taxes. 

Ohio is harder to pin down, because it has so many different political positions (I suppose every state does, but Ohio takes it to the next level). They have a strong evangelical base, a strong libertarian base, and a strong moderate base. Ohio will likely vote for Kasich if he is still around at that point. If Kasich drops out, then Rubio, Bush, Huckabee, and Cruz all stand a fighting chance to win the state. ",1,0,1444165728,1444719379
cvqhwmb,0,t1_cvqchid,eloquentboot,"Out of curiosity, are you American? You seem a bit confused on how the process works exactly. Ohio is hugely important in the general election, but far less important in the primaries. New Hampshire is huge in primaries, but less huge in the general elections (in past years it has been a swing state, though it is probably solidified itself as a blue state).",2,0,1444163170,1444719379
