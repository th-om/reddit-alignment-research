It seems that it would be more of a demon thing, Angels wouldn't really care because they don't do a lot of things the government would try to stop.  However, controlling Federal law enforcement officials and policy is something Crawley would brag about constantly.",1,0,1444391293,1444725413

cvstb13,0,t1_cvss0ji,popus32,"First, I think there is a bit of a difference between climate change and the existence of a massive variety of supernatural beings.  Both may kill you, but only one rips your friends throat out in front of you and drinks his blood while Dean blows its head off.

Second, I'm not talking about the average government official, I'm talking about one unit buried inside a clandestine government agency.  Tie the Men of Letters, and their cache of information, to one founding father (preferably not one of the big named ones) and it becomes very possible for the government to be aware of the supernatural without stumbling across it like bumbling idiots at the 11th hour.

Obviously the show is very popular without this plot point, and I still love it, but this has bothered me since the apocalypse.",1,0,1444331546,1444725413
cvsrgbf,0,t1_cvsrbek,popus32,"I hadn't thought of it that way.  There is certainly more supernatural activity, but that is all the more reason to acknowledge it.

I don't remember the episodes showing the government being controlled by monsters.

I'm rejecting the Harry Potter reasoning and choosing Marvel's response instead: a massively funded, international police force.",1,0,1444328825,1444725413
cvsr770,0,t1_cvsjd46,popus32,"I love the show the way it is.  Probably one of my top three on television at the moment, but I do think there is room to acknowledge their existence without shoving them in unnecessarily.

Personally, I think it could lead to a spin off that more closely resembles early seasons of Supernatural (a monster of the week style police procedural) than the later seasons (massive, season long story lines against unfathomable baddies).  Let the brothers tackle ""the darkness"", while the ""police"" handle werewolves, vampires, and the like across the country.",2,0,1444328460,1444725413
cvsqtuy,0,t1_cvsnfjf,popus32,"Yes, but it was completely secret or too absurd to be believed because it was always one off incidences in small towns.  Now the scale of the bad guys schemes have grown exponentially since season 1.  Plus they (the brothers and the bad guys) routinely use cell phones to communicate which we all know the government can tap.  I'm not saying it should be a huge story line, but the awareness of the government should be acknowledged.  Moreover, I'm not saying the government agency just found out, but is rather just now making themselves known to the brothers.",1,0,1444327937,1444725413

cvr5wz6,0,t1_cvr2uis,popus32,"If every primary/caucus was on the same day, no candidate would visit Iowa or New Hampshire because they are too small and no longer hold the power that comes with being an early voting state.  Most resources would be spent winning big states like New York and California because that's where all the delegates are.  

Plus states that vote later tend to have a winner takes all approach with delegates whereas earlier states give them out proportionally so that would need to be changed to a consistent model.",0,0,1444218624,1444725413

The up front investment would be steep, but after 10 years maybe even less the average citizen of Iraq would find themselves in a better position in life due to the stability and security US forces would provide to the nation.  They would have more infrastructure, better jobs, better education and the stability necessary to significantly grow their GDP.  Moreover, they would not be losing half their country to ISIS right now as we never would have let them cross the border.  Finally, occupation costs would decrease significantly once the rule of law and legitimate local police forces and courts were formed.  There are up front costs required when acquiring anything of significant size and worth so it's not going to be profitable immediately, but after rebuilding it in 20-30 years it would be the economic center of the Middle East.  It's a long game, but I do genuinely believe in the long run it would have been mutually beneficial.

That being said, I don't think the American people have the patience to actually let a plan of that length play out.",1,0,1443354874,1444725413
