Uuuh no. You are not being clear. Republicans are by-n-large For the TPP.

The Senate vote for the TPP fast track was [H.R. 1314.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314) The resolution [was passed by Republican support](http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=114&session=1&vote=00180). 65 Yay: 13 Dems and 48 Repubs. And 33 Nay: *All* Dems or Independents.

As well you can see how the House voted with regards to support of the TPA. [Yet again it passes due to majority support being Republican Yay votes.](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h362)",5,0,1444492894,1444717560

We don't want Marvel veering from the source material and, oh I dunno saaaaay... ruining some of their greatest villains by turning them into expendable one-dimensional caricatures. That could be bad and really show how formulaic and predictable their movies are.",0,0,1444442917,1444717560
