cvtenkx,0,t1_cvsxoqf,brianbeze,Yup I grew up in a house like that.  at the crossroads of two 8 lane highways good god a constant amount of noise and the airport just a bit away as well but it was in a great school district and my parents didnt want to send my siblings and I to a rural minnesota school.  Overall it was allright. I was walking distance to many lakes and forests where I could hike for miles or hop the bus and head to a very metropolitan city.  ,1,0,1444367374,1444720782
cvtcqow,0,t1_cvt95mu,brianbeze,"Shit I used to live in Denver.   Honestly its not that bad if you live with other people.  Denver is a city with a great public transportation system and its not really necessary to have a car.  By the way you don't pay income tax if your below the poverty line (and a bit above as well) you get a full refund.  Cheaper states have cheaper wages.  The wages in new York are not $10 an hour for all but the cheapest jobs. Maybe you don't realize it but the median wage in denver is $10,000 higher than the national median wage.  Come to KC and see how a $15 an hour job becomes a $10 an hour gig in 7 hour driving time.   I hate people whining about how hard it is about as much as I hate people whining about how easy people have it. Oh and at $10 an hour you can afford a studio ($800 is not really that difficult to find) or even better just split a $1300 a month 2br.  That still leaves $800 a month to pay all other expenses on.  200 bucks a week.  Its not great but I've done with less.  Point is is that even if your paying $100 bucks on your car and $100 bucks on utilities (never gets that high in a studio really) you still have money left over.   ",1,0,1444362937,1444720782

cvsgelj,1,t3_3nv17q,brianbeze,Maybe people just dont want to pay $500 for clothes that look like you got them at target.,0,0,1444312074,1444720782
cvsgbtm,0,t1_cvs7qqi,brianbeze,Holy fuck a plain grey sweatshirt for $500 who's stupid enough to.... I mean I wont buy that because he's straight.,18,0,1444311930,1444720782
cvsfxb7,0,t1_cvs1myj,brianbeze,"Don't worry you wont starve.  If you are making so little you should get food stamps and use food pantry's. Thats what they are for.  Being in a small town can really suck in terms of the job market.  Don’t worry you'll find something in no time and be back to saving.  I was homeless for two years but not helpless, there are lots of little ways to get free food, clothing and other supplies. ",3,0,1444311168,1444720782
cvsfovj,0,t1_cvru3ub,brianbeze,No its not. Thats only 1200 a year.  If you cant save more than that then its hard to have a rainy day fund. It means bills are too close to income.,2,0,1444310711,1444720782
cvs4qk5,0,t1_cvrs84v,brianbeze,"Giving 100% into destroying Isis is another Vietnam and nobody wants that.  We do much better just expending just enough energy keeping Isis handicapped and unable to effect us honestly.  Russia, Syria, Iran and china were already aligned. Iraq... well they honestly have no choice in the matter as they depend on the U.S for defence at this point.  If Russia wants that quagmire they can have it, I hope they try to deal with Afghanistan too.  ",1,0,1444275685,1444720782
cvs3ma6,0,t1_cvs2vzf,brianbeze,"There is actually asurprising even amount of immigrants emmigrants to and from kc and minneapolis (heard a bit on npr I'll see if I can find it)  Also median wage is about proportions not overall population.  The fact is is that half of KC metro area makes less than 55,000 and half makes more and half of the twin cities metro area makes 65,000 and half makes more (median wage not adjusted for cost of living)  Unemployment rate is the same the population size is not whats important its the proportion.  Johnson county is rich, but its all suburbs whereas hennipen county includes the inner city.  Surprisingly hennipen county still has a lower unemployment rate. Median income is $75,000 in jhonson county (wow such money)  but its $93,000 in eden prarie obviosly not representative of the metro areas  Everyone that moves here for work moved to get a higher wage so thats probably why most people tell you they are making more, because they are! this doesn’t change the fact that in general people are earning a lower income here by a good margin than in the twin cities.   Sorry I'm on mobile if it looks atrocious. ",1,0,1444273583,1444720782
