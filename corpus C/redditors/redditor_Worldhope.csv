I agree they need to go, legal immigration needs to be enforced.
My point was the hysteria and what got him to the front of the polls is singling out a single ethnic group and using the rallying cry of we need to get them out to get ahead... How does that not evoke that imagery???",-1,0,1441605539,1444731994

After reading it , it spawned interesting questions like, what if the mother was legal, but the father wasnt? There is a lot of grey areas. 

Im going to drop the right to choose topic and not bring up the lack of support for lgbt rights, because that will likely cause this thread to go in another direction altogether.

So, going back to my original point , this election has retreated to messages of divisiveness, attacks and haven't really heard any messaging that doesnt involve attacking someone or walling.

Where are the policies and messages of hope?",1,0,1441603321,1444731994

cut6tnz,0,t1_cut6bzi,Worldhope,"Well let's look at the news:


*that whole thing about Bush answering a spanish question in spanish
*I don't support illegal immigrants, but stripping people of their 
Citizenship?!?
*a wall to keep the Mexicans out
*a wall to keep Canadians out (they'd politely leave if asked )
*rolling back woman's right to choose


I don't see much messaging of hope. Well sure ""let's make America great again"". Be the shinning example...


The Trump comment at the end was suggesting if he did get elected, Im dreading what is going to get rolled back...
