So, where I live her official title is: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God Queen of New Zealand and Her Other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith. Nothing about being the Queen of the United Kingdom. I know what you're saying, but it's a slight misstatement.",8,0,1444448566,1444718572
cvuh1ao,0,t1_cvube3e,crasspy,"If that rocks your boat; good for you. But aren't you worried it's a gesture? Most people in this World live in desperate hardship and while you're emulating their suffering...you're sort of playing at it. I suspect there are billions in this World who would do almost anything to have the privileges and comforts of a first world existence that you've shunned. I suspect many of them would find the idea of someone voluntarily opting out of these as risible. Do you not think that you're entire life is cosseted by the system you reject? OK, your eco-footprint might be a lot smaller than some but, ultimately, you remain within and a part of that system. I guess we all do what we can. Judging others is unproductive. And I like that you're trying to do something different. But, if I were you, I'd be troubled about living an entitled life (a life so entitled you get to choose to live in poverty...which, I think a lot of people in the World would find amazing) and yet, because of those choices you're not actually contributing to that system in a meaningful way. I mean, it's laudable and all, but don't you feel weird that you're playing at being poor and benefiting from the system you reject (think of the security and safety you enjoy)? What's more I suspect you do not contribute to that system (i.e you're not paying taxes or contributing to society in other ways)?  I am not judging...just curious... do you worry about these things?

Have you consumed any animal products lately? Have you driven or ridden in a car or some other form of polluting mass transport? I guess life is full of choices. Hard to stand on the high moral ground when, globally speaking, it's likely you are the 1%.",1,0,1444430102,1444718572

cvnn6h5,0,t1_cvndusu,crasspy,"I was told it's a gram per kilo - which makes sense given a gram is a metric weight. If you're operating in Imperial then shouldn't the rule be one ounce per pound or something like that? I don't know, I live outside of the US/Britain, so I operate in metric only. But in my World, I'm pretty sure the rule is 1 gram at least per kilo. You're about 95 kilos, so you'd need to eat about 95 kilos of protein - which is more than half what you've been trying to consume. I gotta admit, I don't understand why people persist with Imperial measures when most of the World is metric. The inconsistency produces these types of misunderstandings. ",1,0,1443953469,1444718572
