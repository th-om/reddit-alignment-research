cv3rq6g,0,t1_cv3pfxi,PanTardovski,"Yep, and calculating weird min raises like this primarily only comes up in cases like reraising a straddle as a pot-building move, where you can raise to $8 from $5. The weird nature of the forced blind bet is where the confusion comes from. Post-flop any raises are going to have to at least double the initial bet, and min-reraises are going to be pretty rare except in elaborate trapping maneuvers, i.e. three players to the flop. Player A bets out $50, B raises to $150, now player C could reraise to $250 (rather than $300), but how often is player C going to want to raise at all (and likely drive out A) without raising significantly more than the minimum?",2,0,1442428364,1444732258
cv39j47,0,t1_cv39guy,PanTardovski,"Yeah, it's such a finicky bit of wording and it comes up so little and people already generally know what you mean anyway. It's just something I've had to explain recently so it was on my mind.",2,0,1442387222,1444732258
cv39hut,1,t3_3l4jv3,PanTardovski,"This is a great list. As a very green dealer myself I'd like to reiterate ""LET THE DEALER DO THEIR JOB"". If a newer dealer is having trouble making change or splitting a side pot the one thing that absolutely will not help them is trying to shout the correct answer at them (even though you most likely are correct and genuinely want to help).

It's the dealer's responsibility to get the pot right, and even if your advice is correct the dealer will have to work through the whole process themself to verify your advice. Worse yet, when three different players are explaining the math three different ways then the dealer isn't even working through the chop anymore, they're just waiting for everyone to stop talking. Let the dealer work and if you're really concerned that there's some sort of error ask for a floor call -- that's what the floor's for.

As a former ""helpful"" player believe me, not much slows down a game or messes up a pot as bad as helpful players (though if you want to move the button or help us reach for ghost blinds in the 2 or 7 seats that's a whole different story).",3,0,1442387088,1444732258
cv39e1p,0,t1_cv38na5,PanTardovski,"One slight clarification -- the minimum legal raise (in NL and PL) is the size of the previous bet **or** raise, i.e. if the blind is $2 and UTG straddles (raises) to $5 the minimum raise would be to $8 -- the straddle raised $3, so the next raise can be for another $3 or more. Raising an initial bet or the big blind then the simple rule is ""at least double the bet"" but a reraise can potentially be more complicated.",3,0,1442386712,1444732258

Apparently you could be convinced to murder or at least unlawfully detain homeless people if I just told you some lies about them; by your rationale you are now eligible to do jail time just for being gullible.

You're literally criminalizing mental illness. You have no possible justification, just a clumsy kind of bigotry and an apparent inability to read. Go back to dry humping old issues of *Soldier of Fortune* and leave the grownups in peace now.",2,0,1442290044,1444732258

cv1yywx,0,t1_cv1yn3j,PanTardovski,"Cute how you avoid addressing absolutely any part of my actual argument. If you put a two year old behind the trigger of an M60 they could conceivably pull the trigger and kill somebody, so I guess we should be locking up those murderous little shitsacks too! Mental competency, agency, and capability all factor into whether or not someone is a threat. The FBI stings have literally pressured people into accepting money, (fake) weapons, and plans that the supposed terrorists were uncomfortable being involved with.

If I throw a match through you open window and then rush into your house to put out the fire I didn't save you, I'm just an asshole. When the FBI dresses up the homeless and mentally ill like criminals the FBI hasn't saved anyone either. These pretend stings are nothing but porno for people hungry for evidence of a threat that just isn't as big or as dramatic as the security state needs you to believe it is.",2,0,1442287932,1444732258
