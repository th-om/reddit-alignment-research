I still contend that Central Jersey is a myth created by people too ashamed to admit that they live in South Jersey.",0,0,1444668873,1444722649

That was a tax cut and state government bailout bill.

It didn't spend *that* much on infrastructure.

$25b to roads and bridges is peanuts compared to what we need to spend.",1,0,1444603606,1444722649

cvvciw0,0,t1_cvvbilm,Irrumatus,"I think once the secrets of OLED manufacture are out, the technology to create them will be more accessible than what it takes to build an LCD.

LCDs require a lot of very specialized processes, and massive plants dedicated to the task.

If we can work out how to make OLEDs how people have been thinking we'll ultimately be mass producing them, it's basically glorified inkjet technology.

By virtue of the number of companies that will be doing it, there won't be any way for the price to be grossly inflated.

At the end of the day, an OLED is arguably a simpler device than an LCD. (Hell, it's a common sophomore year engineering lab assignment to build a simple OLED. I did it like 10 years ago. I'm sure what we made wouldn't have lasted more than a couple weaks before degrading, but the fact of the matter is that they're simpler devices, in function, than LCDs)

We just have a few rather major kinks to work in building them.",1,0,1444525765,1444722649

Once in a blue moon I'll eat one, though.

I will never eat green apple. Shit's gross.

I always use it when I make batter for fried foods, in chinese food, dips, etc. It can really take something that's good and make it great.",3,0,1444520491,1444722649
