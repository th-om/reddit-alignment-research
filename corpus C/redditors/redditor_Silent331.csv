cvxc5n6,1,t3_3ohk10,Silent331,"This has come up a number of times in the fourms and I have 2 awnsers.

1. Defense forces are reactionary and vary in responsiveness. From static emplacements (instant enforcement) to ships warping in (takes time). Either way someone can still shoot a missile at your ship, it may cost them theirs, but that can do it.

2. If you ever say ""I should be able to do X with zero risk"" you are doing it wrong.",1,0,1444682512,1444725014

cvx14xo,0,t1_cvw4ld7,Silent331,"The issue is that the turret positions are just to good for the attackers. A few examples are. The 2 turrets in front of the entrance to the base, they can shoot straight in to the base at the CP. Move those to the sides so they can't see inside but still shoot toward the ATAT. Another one is the turrets right behind spawn points that can't really see anything besides that spawn and is never used by the rebels because they either have to run up to the objective or way way back for the last one.

Go in to a solo game and plant the bomb, slowly do 360s and make sure you can hear the beep from any angle. I had a driver issue causing me to have 3 small audio deadzones",1,0,1444429902,1444725014
