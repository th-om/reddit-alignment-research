cvtwvpz,0,t1_cvtvc64,katilakoski,"I think there is a middle ground here. I've worked supermarket retail before, and it's soul crushing, utterly depressing and unrewarding ""how did my life end up here"" work even when you're being paid for it. I can't imagine how worse that is when you're doing it for free (or for benefits). Especially if you've got a dickhead manager that's treating you like some sort of indentured servant. 

That said, there *are* some skills you can get from it, *assuming* you're someone who is an unskilled labourer with little previous job experience. Team work, communication, motivation etc. Basic, foundational transferable skills. But tbh, it is a limited, very foundational skillset. After several months of working the job you'll have learnt all the skills you're ever going to. 

This sort of thing is only useful for a) very specific candidates (long term, unskilled unemployed with little work experience) and b) for a relatively short period of time. Assuming OP fits the bill, I agree he should try to focus on what limited experience he is gaining from it, if only to remain motivated. But I can really sympathise with how depressing that situation can get in the long run.

cvr77af,0,t1_cvr30x8,katilakoski,"Representative democracy isn't unique to the US, nor is the US really the ""founder"" of representative democracy. Parliamentary systems, which are representative democracies, existed long before the US was even conceptualised. Hell, America achieved its independence from a country which practiced representative democracy in the form of a parliamentary system. 

You could make the case that the US was the first example of successful *federalism*. I can't recall from the top of my head a significant historical case study of a federalist country achieving global, hegemonic success. Maybe republican Rome? But that had to devolve to an imperial system to survive. Certainly in the contemporary world the US is the obvious model for which to emulate republican, federal style government. 

Representative democracy however is definitely older than the US. To attribute it's foundations to America is misleading. ",1,0,1444222098,1444721978

cvpzdsl,0,t1_cvpxli4,katilakoski,"It does feel very short term. The question is, why do some children truant? Understand that and you can craft effective policy. I suspect the answer is a complicated one that includes factors such as chronic poverty, a lack of education, dysfunctional social dynamics at home and a whole host of other reasons. 

Docking benefits doesn't really address any of that. It doesn't even attempt to answer the question of ""why?"" It merely provides a short term panacea to a problem that's caused by several deep rooted factors that are weaved into the social fabric.

As you say. It feels right. It appeals to the notion of justice. But when examined does it actually remedy any of the social and economic issues that cause trouble children to truant?",2,0,1444132477,1444721978

cvj2wru,0,t1_cviti3q,katilakoski,"It's funny. The whole ""small government"" ideal is one of the core principles of classical liberalism. The American political lexicon has perverted the world ""liberal"" so much however that it now is just a meaningless byword for ""left wing"". 

The same is true for ""conservatism"". What Americans call fiscal conservatism is essentially just neoliberalism. Hell, being pro guns is a liberal position, not a conservative one (in the original sense of the word). 

The only time conservative is really applicable is to the socially conservative branch of the party. The moralist, traditional republicans who advocate for religiously motivated policies or believe in strong law and order. 

Small government republicans are liberals in the original sense of the word. I think it's disheartening that these terms have become so conflated and diluted, as I think it makes finding common ground between the left and right so much harder when everyone is split into a mischaracterised team of ""conservative"" or ""liberal"".

The FT if you can handle how dry it is. 

Maybe the economist if you prefer a more neoliberal view to a traditional conservative one. This was my go to ""challenge my viewpoint"" news source in my student days. Although the subscriptions pretty dear. ",7,0,1443542622,1444721978

That said *some* Muslims *are* okay with it. So my question is, how is it that you apparently know for certain that this man isn't? That he *is* a homophobe?

The answer is you don't. You're making assumptions based on your own preconceived notions. Personally I refrain from slandering people with labels until I know for certain they apply to them. I'm sure you'd be the first person to cry if you were wrongly labelled a racist based on other peoples assumptions.
