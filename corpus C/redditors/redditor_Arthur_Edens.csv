It's not sentient and cannot enjoy anything. It's *owners* can enjoy it's benefits, but it can't.   ",1,1,1444705686,1444718426
cvxky5j,0,t1_cvxeyhq,Arthur_Edens,"> A corporation is benefiting from a govt, possibly more than anyone other than the nation itself.

Saying a corporation benefits from government is like saying a car benefits from smooth roads.  The car doesn't benefit; the driver and the owner of the car do.  A corporation is an inanimate, abstract idea.  It can't enjoy anything.  The people who own it benefit from the government greatly, but a corporation itself doesn't.  ",1,1,1444696268,1444718426
cvxdwo7,0,t1_cvxd03a,Arthur_Edens,"Kind of an interesting problem. My gut reaction is to say ""nothing. It's going to be reinvested or disbursed eventually. We'll tax it then."" Apple has been getting serious flak from shareholders lately about not giving much in dividends even though it's sitting on a quarter trillion dollars in cash. I think most shareholders would think the same eventually.  It doesn't so a company a whole lot of good to just sit on a mountain of cash long term. Money is only useful if you use it. 

I'm wondering what kind of bad incentives this would make, though. Every idea is bound to have blowback.

Also, corporate personhood and natural personhood are completely different and unrushed concepts. People kill corporations all the time and no one goes to jail. ",3,0,1444682131,1444718426

cvxawjn,0,t1_cvx9iff,Arthur_Edens,Corporate personhood and corporate taxation are two different things.

cvx9tp4,0,t1_cvx80k7,Arthur_Edens,"> Edge cases exist where the genetic code is shared (such as fraternal twins), and different processes can lead to cells with novel dna but in the former case it is clear that they are different entities and in the latter it is just DNA damage.

Edge cases are useful if they demonstrate a distinction. Saying a cancerous cell's DNA is just damage is a matter of perspective.  If the cancerous cell were self aware, it certainly wouldn't consider itself 'just damage.' And identical twins wouldn't say they're the same. Both of those cases suggest that self awareness is a more important criteria of personhood than unique DNA. ",1,0,1444679217,1444718426
cvx8qc3,0,t1_cvx639u,Arthur_Edens,"Yeah, but I'm saying just tax the owners the full cost directly instead of making it unnecessarily complicated and taxing at a lower rate through two levels instead of a higher rate through one.  Instead of taxing once at the corporate rate and once at the capital gains rate (assuming the owner has held the shares long enough), why not just tax it once as ordinary income?
