cvvwagm,0,t1_cvvu0nl,Temp55551111,"Because the act of molesting a child causes harm, while the act of having a holstered firearm on your hip causes no harm.

The better analogy would be making sitting on a bench at a park while children are around illegal for single men.  But that would be ridiculous, right?",6,0,1444580043,1444718008
cvv1bgr,0,t1_cvv0grh,Temp55551111,"I'm fairly pro gun, and while I disagree that *all* ""gun control's"" point is background checks (see: the AWB, magazine caps, etc.), I want to say that I'm totally onboard with your proposals!

I completely support expanding federal background checks to allow law abiding citizens to perform a **free** check on any would-be private buyers - I would absolutely love that!

...and so would the [NRA](https://www.nraila.org/articles/20150406/nevada-gun-background-bill-clears-senate-moves-to-assembly)!  Gun control proponents could get this bill passed federally tomorrow, but they don't because they are unfortunately not interested in compromise that would undoubtedly lead to incremental improvement.  I hope that changes because like you I believe there are millions of law abiding gun owners that would love to ensure they don't sell guns to criminals and right now they cannot do this easily.",9,0,1444504815,1444718008

cvp03zf,1,t3_3nkqmw,Temp55551111,"Many others have already made other points about effectiveness, implementability, and unintended consequences, but I just wanted to point out that almost three quarters (73%) of Americans are opposed to your proposal for a handgun ban.

It may be a surprise to those who live in heavily liberal areas, but opposition to a handgun ban is likely one of the things we agree upon **the most** as a country.  As a random example, only 59% of Americans consider themselves ""sports fans.""  Opposition to a handgun ban is more popular than watching the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, NCAA, etc. (Thats amazing to me, personally, and I already had an idea how unpopular gun bans are.)

cva93ry,0,t1_cv9s2z7,Temp55551111,"That makes sense assuming no principal repayment. However, to assume no principal repayment you need to assume the ability to refinance at 5% in perpetuity. As the debt to GDP level goes up (which is assured under your borrow $1B to earn $51+ minus $50M plan as this is a $1B to $51M ratio), future interest rates will rise.  This will have a multiplying effect on other existing debt as it gets refinanced as well.

Many of us concerned about the US debt (and more importantly deficit) situation are not concerned about the near-term impact of investing in the country using debt. Rather, we're concerned about the impact on future rates, which will rise as a result.",3,0,1442935683,1444718008
