Let him blow a fuckton of money like they did back with Afghanistan in the 80's (*not even gonna wonder how much we've blown there with our misadventure*) and then they can deal with all the bullshit during and after.

cvwelmn,1,t3_3ocacz,jasenlee,I'd be curious as to how much extra money he raises every time an article like this goes up. It seems like half the time I see a post like this lauding his latest fundraising dollars I see one or two people mention that they decided to go and contribute after reading the article. ,2,0,1444610148,1444732246
cvunao4,0,t1_cvun5gj,jasenlee,"Then figure out what your current and projected needs are and then negotiate the most advantageous contract from which ever supplier gives the best price. 

I'm not trying to be a contrarian with all responses here but people are complaining about a problem with solutions. 

The problem is complex and vague licenses. The solution is getting a handle on your assets (*preferably with a Software Asset Management tool*) and having a solid procurement team to negotiate the contract that works for your company. 

When you are in the buying stage you are in control. When you are in the audit stage they are in control. If you do your homework up front when you are in charge you have nothing to worry about later. ",2,0,1444468680,1444732246

cvu62td,0,t1_cvu5crq,jasenlee,You are spot on with that and Oracle. There are several small procurement consulting firms who only specialize in helping companies negotiate their Oracle contracts. I know a few of them were started by former Oracle employees. ,5,0,1444426156,1444732246
cvu592y,0,t1_cvtvum2,jasenlee,"> Microsoft and Oracle are predatory companies when it comes to software licenses.

I work in tech and a lot of people say this and there is a lot of nuance in some licensing agreements but you can't blame either Oracle or Microsoft. 

Organisations around the world install all sorts of shit and then they are worried about whether they are over-licensed or under-licensed and in some cases buy more to cover their asses. 

In reality if they would just buy a simple Software Asset Management tool (*hell there are even a lot of good ones for free*) they wouldn't have this problem. They would know how many licenses they own and wouldn't over-buy or under-buy. 

If I went to Tesco and bought a bunch of extra eggs because I couldn't remember how many I had at home I wouldn't bitch about Tesco being some predatory company. I'd blame myself. 

I scream about this to companies all the freaking time... buy a damn asset tracking tool. It will pay for itself in the first year alone.

cvtde0z,1,t3_3nzbrv,jasenlee,The bickering in this thread about serial numbers seems like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic to me. We all get it. We all know what has happened. Like it or not at this point any country to get back some of their gold (*recast or not*) should feel lucky and if they haven't started attempting to repatriate it they should now so they can at least have a chance of getting something before the house of cards comes falling down. ,3,0,1444364291,1444732246
