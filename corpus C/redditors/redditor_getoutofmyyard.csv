cvoa2am,1,t3_3nfo5s,getoutofmyyard,"A picture of my dog hit #1 on Reddit a couple of years ago (you can find it in my post history). Somehow a massive conversation about steak started. After that, literally hundreds of people sent me their thoughts, recipes, or ideas on steak. ",3,0,1443997471,1444727537
cvo0r41,1,t3_3nf6ff,getoutofmyyard,"How can one delude themselves into believing that he/she is wonderful or above-average in every way and expect to attain a happier life? Everyone has flaws, and it's recognizing those flaws approaching them responsibly, optimistically, and constructively that makes us better people. This is the same advice that leads untalented, uninteresting, or otherwise fucked-up people to believe that they shouldn't even try to change anything about themselves to find a better way of living.

This is awful advice that I sense is coming from someone who hasn't lived through enough trouble to recognize how destructive it is.",2,0,1443983493,1444727537

Or white people, or native americans, or the inuit, or Mexicans.... Come on, dude. ",1,0,1443208517,1444727537
cve2dij,0,t1_cvdyo77,getoutofmyyard,"My opinion is that what you're referring to is a form of reaction against Muslim extremists who would (and have, and will) kill innocent people for expressing their right to free speech. The Ayotallah Khomeini issued a fatwa against Salman Rushdie after the *Satanic Verses* was released, calling for his death. We all know what happened at Charlie Hebdo. We all know about Kurt Westergarrd, a Danish cartoonist who has endured *numerous* assassination attempts and now lives under constant police protection after drawing a cartoon featuring Muhammed, which is simply an exercise of his rights under the laws of Denmark. In Germany, non-Muslims are being assaulted regularly by Syrian refugees for saying or doing generally non-Muslim things, like simply wearing their religious garb in public.

So, you ask ""Who's afraid of criticizing Islam,"" but you seem to know nothing about what has happened to the people who have done just that. ",0,0,1443208306,1444727537
cvb0oit,1,t3_3m0ef2,getoutofmyyard,"Dark Souls. I would like to play a DLC which takes you back to the events immediately following the advent of the Age of Fire. It would be awesome to interact with the gods while the goings were good - Gwyn presiding on his throne, the Four Knights doing their respective things, Seath the Scaleless being a widely respected scholar, etc.

Maybe the context could have something to do with events only alluded to in the main story, like Kalameet assaulting Astora, Gwyn's firstborn losing his deific status, Crossbreed Prescilla's conception and exile... Man, I would play the hell out of that.",1,0,1442980697,1444727537
