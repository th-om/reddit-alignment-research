cvx0nh8,0,t1_cvwz2fo,prinzplagueorange,"Yes.  And while there might be good moral reasons for speaking about parents having moral obligations to their children (or even potential children), those arguments really can't be drawn upon to establish the rights of the fetus.  One could, for instance, assemble a decent virtue ethics argument about an obligation for all humans to think like loving parents, and then one could argue that a loving parent would respond to late-term abortion (or euthanasia) with horror.  But that would be an argument based on sentiment, not rights.  The problem is that we live in a culture that is committed (for generally good reasons) to celebrating family and caring for children, but that opponents of abortion attempt to wed that culture of family values to a fundamentally different discourse of rights.  This is why feminists argue that anti-abortion is about controlling women's bodies: they think (correctly) that it is about pressuring (unwilling) women to embrace motherhood.  I would prefer if it conservatives would drop the so-called rights of the unborn and think seriously about what a non-sexist culture of family values would look like.",2,0,1444665681,1444720997
cvwzwyn,0,t1_cvwy564,prinzplagueorange,"There are two problems with this utilitarian objection to abortion: 1) a utilitarian would generally argue for a positive obligation to promote utility (not simply a position that abortion is bad because it interferes with utility).  If the creation of new children is understood to raise the sum total of happiness, then everyone would be under an obligation to reproduce as much as possible (or at least until the point at which further reproduction would start reducing the amount of happiness, due to food scarcity, for instance).  It also means that failing to reproduce to one's full potential would seem to be the equivalent of murder.  2) Utilitarian arguments notoriously lack a good meta-ethical foundation: What creates this moral obligation to promote utility?  I believe most contemporary utilitarians follow R.M. Hare in trying to create a utilitarian foundation on top of Kantian foundations.  This might work, but the problem for abortion is that for Kant, rights would come from the obligation to respect others' choices (the reasoning of others), and fetuses are the kind of creatures that do not yet possess reason.  A Kantian-Utilitarian hybrid position would call for maximizing rational preference satisfaction and fetuses would factor into that moral calculation only in so far as the creation of more people either pleased or displeased (rational) adults.",2,0,1444664501,1444720997
cvwyw9x,0,t1_cvwwlo2,prinzplagueorange,"The point is not whether a scientist would categorize the fetus as a human being.  Rather, the question is whether the fetus should be categorized as a rights-bearing person, person in a moral not a scientific sense (as science does not deal with questions of morality).  Most rights theorists traditionally connect rights to possession of reason.  This, for instance, is the basis of most Kantian and many utilitarian moral theories.  The fetus only potentially possesses reason and, therefore, does not possess rights.",2,0,1444662795,1444720997
cvwull7,1,t3_3of7i5,prinzplagueorange,"Here are two secular anti-abortion positions (though I wouldn't defend either of them).  1) it is always wrong to kill an innocent life form and the fetus is an innocent life form (so is a blade of grass but never mind).  2) people are morally obligated to promote the greatest amount of happiness, and the more adult humans, the greater the amount of happiness in the world; therefore people are morally obligated to reproduce as much as possible (this conflates not having as many kids as possible with murder but never mind).",4,0,1444653799,1444720997
cvwu7zp,0,t1_cvwk8e7,prinzplagueorange,"The conservative position is supposedly ""right to life"".  The position that one ought not to kill innocent life is morally plausible. The difficulty with it, though, is that there are many non-human forms of life.  This is why Jainists don't eat meat.  It also raises problems for how you deal with lifeforms like bacteria and viruses.  American conservatives don't recognize these problems because they are really advocating for a "" right to human life"".  It is unclear what justifies either this restricted focus on human life or the position that the life of the human fetus should be regarded as of the same moral worth as the life of an adult human as opposed to an organism that it is more developmentally similar to the human fetus (such as a cow fetus), but the rationale would seem to be implicitly biblical.",1,0,1444652695,1444720997
cvvr67t,1,t3_3o8rzo,prinzplagueorange,"Technically one does not have to hold religious beliefs about the fetus having a soul to believe that moral personhood precedes birth, but in reality almost everyone who does believe this (especially the idea that personhood begins at conception) is probably doing so for unacknowledged religious reasons.  Almost no opponents of abortion are vegans, though if one were adhering to a secular understanding of moral personhood and opposed abortion, one should be a vegan.  The underlying belief is that human fetuses have souls and animals do not.",1,0,1444568121,1444720997
cvu4717,0,t1_cvu030v,prinzplagueorange,"[Here](http://marianamazzucato.com/the-entrepreneurial-state/) is a summary of Mariana Mazzucato's (economist at the University of Sussex) book The Entreprenurial State: ""The book comprehensively debunks the myth of a lumbering, bureaucratic state versus a dynamic, innovative private sector. In a series of case studies—from IT, biotech, nanotech to today’s emerging green tech—Professor Mazzucato shows that the opposite is true: the private sector only finds the courage to invest after an entrepreneurial state has made the high-risk investments.""  Mazzucato basically defends the military industrial complex's (DARPA) role in driven technological innovation, though, I'm guessing she would also say there are better ways the state could drive innovation than funding weaponry.",-1,0,1444423139,1444720997
cvtm30p,1,t3_3o3ce1,prinzplagueorange,Shrinking the size of the federal government would badly damage the economy because capitalism needs a large federal government in order to thrive.  This is why the modern state emerged alongside of capitalism.  The only real way to reduce the influence of money over the electoral system is to reduce the wealth of rich people.  The way to do this is through high progressive taxes and sustained full employment (which puts upward pressure on wages).,-4,0,1444394207,1444720997

It sounds like ""liberal who worries about the environment,"" which leaves people wondering how that is different from the Democratic party.  Second, running candidates in elections they could not possibly win earned them both the hostility of a lot of liberals (Nader in 2000) and the sense that they represented a strategic dead end.
