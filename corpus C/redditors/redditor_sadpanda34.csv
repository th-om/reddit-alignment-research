Conditions was perhaps the wrong word, nuance may be better.

The vast majority simply agree.  ",1,0,1444418139,1444729156

Krugman does support free trade, no economist wouldn't.  However he seems to think the TPP is still a bad idea because:

>The glory days of trade negotiations — the days of deals like the Kennedy Round of the 1960s, which sharply reduced tariffs around the world — are long behind us.
Why? Basically, old-fashioned trade deals are a victim of their own success: there just isn’t much more protectionism to eliminate.

In other words he doesn't like some provisions of the TPP, and thinks the benefits of more free trade are outweighed by policies he opposes.

But ~95% of economists agree with this question: Freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment.

cvphg9z,1,t3_3nljd8,sadpanda34,"My family has an indoor/outdoor cat named Sultan that we adopted as an adolescent from a shelter.  When we got him we decided to keep him as an indoor cat because like you say, indoor cats generally do have a longer lifespan.  When we got him he was quite skittish always hiding and running away, certainly not a lap cat.  He usually seemed stressed.  Over the next few months he got extremely interested in the outdoors.  He would follow animals from one window to the next racing around the house.  When we woke up sometimes we would see the hall carpets bunched up in the corner, a result of his running and then sliding from one window to the next and using the carpets to stop his run.  He was obsessed with the outside.  

Well one day waiting by the door he saw an opening and in an instant he was gone...escaped and finally free!  We didn't see him for 2 days.  It turned out he likely never even crossed the street.   When we finally saw him he always keept out of arms distance.  He didn’t want to be picked up and brought back inside. He was not frightened or stressed at all, in fact he was having a blast.  He would simply sit on the porch with us, just out of arms distance, and be purring so loud you could hear it from the other side of the porch.  Hunger eventually got the better of him and we were finally able to get him back inside after another day or so.  

We talked about letting him outside sometimes because now that he got a taste of freedom it seemed cruel to keep him as a prisoner.  After a few days of weighing the pros and cons - another escape!  He seemed to be getting wise to our patterns.  When the door was unlocked the sound would cause him to race to the door opening to make a surprise escape.

Well our decision was made for us.  He was going outside weather we liked it or not.  It was simply a question of whether he would get out as a ‘lost cat’ or if we let him out.   Gradually we let him outside and he began to trust us to let him out.  His interest in sitting by the windows evaporated, and he also quickly got less stressed around us.

Now that he is 17 years old he doesn't go out as much.  His vision isn't very good so he doesn't want to stay out very long.  He also never goes out in the winter anymore but he doesn’t seem to mind.  The loud purring he did for the first time while simply sitting on the porch now happens everywhere, on the couch, on our laps, and while being petted.  Going in a quiet room at may parent’s house there is a good chance you will hear a low rumble coming from his direction.  Maybe keeping him inside could have given him a few more years, but what would it have looked like?   The comparison is between a longer life where he runs from window to window watching the excitement from outside while constantly stressed, or perhaps a shorter life of happiness so great that even sitting on a porch or couch gives him reason to purrr.
