cvvir2h,0,t1_cvvin5s,Information_Landmine,"Yeah after watching it more I can see that the throw prevented it from being a sure thing, but he was still moving towards the bag and not being pulled in a different direction. But yeah, beyond that the slide was just super fucking dirty. Definitely could/should have been called interference.",1,0,1444537677,1444722086

cvvi9nb,1,t3_3oa06h,Information_Landmine,WTF! The throw didn't take him off the bag! He was moving towards the bag while reaching for it. No way that should have been reviewable.,8,0,1444536711,1444722086

cvrt4l7,0,t1_cvrcxwd,Information_Landmine,"I agree in this case. I enjoy challenging platformers (like getting 100% completion in Rayman games) but not insane difficulty just for the sake of making you go crazy. The trophy requirement for beating each world without dying is even more insane.

For these reasons I decided this was not a game for me and deleted it.",1,0,1444256095,1444722086
cvqcigc,0,t1_cvq93ld,Information_Landmine,"Yeah, definitely. I think you're right that even with the huge array of sounds and effects that are easy to get from new tech-y gear, it's still out of the price range of the general hobbyist player... and that's the crux of the problem since that base is dwindling so the gear becomes more niche and has to cost more.

I've been pining for an Axe FX for a while, but I'm definitely interested in checking out the Helix now. I currently still use a Pod X3, Mesa Quad Pre, Mesa 20/20 and recto 4x12. I'm not ready to give up the real IIc+ sounds from the Quad as the sims in the X3 don't sound as real, but maybe the Helix can do it? I bet the Axe FX can, but I haven't been able to try one.",1,0,1444155332,1444722086
cvpxln7,0,t1_cvptq3e,Information_Landmine,"Check out the brand new Fractal AX8, a floorboard axe fx for $1400 with all the same algorithms but less available DSP (so only one amp model at once). Line 6 also just shipped Helix ($1500 but eligible for discounts from the usual places) which looks to take on Kemper and Fractal too. 

Sure these aren't at the $500 Pod price point, but better than $2-3k.",1,0,1444125719,1444722086
