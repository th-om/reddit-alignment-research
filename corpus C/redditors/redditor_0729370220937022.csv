cvu5gwu,0,t1_cvu4dm6,0729370220937022,"I'm quite a bit sceptical of non-primary sources concerning the TPP. A lot of news articles seem to be taking quotes out of context and fear-mongering for clicks.

 I haven't seen anything in the leaked drafts that is fundamentally different we already have NAFTA, so I was under the impression that not much had changed. It's quite possible I'm wrong about the differences between this and existing ISDS clauses. I'll re-read the leaks and edit this comment or something with sources.

As for the tabacco thing, [all you have to do is google it] (http://www.wired.com/2015/10/it-just-got-a-lot-harder-for-big-tobacco-to-defend-itself-trans-pacific-partnership/). 

Honestly I'm reserving judgement on the TPP until the full, final, draft is leaked. There are some legit concerns with the TPP, I just don't think that the hyperbolic claims about countries losing their sovereignty are justifiable or accurate.

cvu4119,0,t1_cvu07z8,0729370220937022,"Literally the opposite of what you wrote is the truth. Despite all the claims to the contrary, ISDS doesn't allow a company to sue for 'lost profits'. It only allows companies to sue and win for the violation of any of the four fundamental protections of the investment protection chapter. As compensation they can be awarded lost profits, however they can't sue because of lost profits. 

As for your example of tabacco companies, they are specifically excluded from being able to sue countries under TPP.

Countries also don't lose any sovereignty under TPP. ISDS is already present under NAFTA, so not much changed in this regard.",8,0,1444422844,1444726452

cvsica6,0,t1_cvshjzv,0729370220937022,"Thats not really what a negative income tax is. A negative income tax is not setting a minimum income — say 40'000 dollars — and making up the difference if you don't make that amount. A NIT works a little different. Under a NIT your wage is supplemented by the tax, but by progressively less as you earn more. 

Let's say we live under a NIT system with 40'000 dollars as the breakeven point, and your family makes 40'000 dollars a year. You will pay no taxes and be given no taxes. However, if you make 50'000 dollars you will pay taxable income on the extra 10'000 you made. On the other hand, say you only made 30'000. You now have a negative deductible income of 10'000 dollars, and assuming a 50% rate, you will make a extra 5000 dollars though the NIT subsidy. If you made 20'000 dollars you have a negative deductible income of 20'000 and will get 50% of that — 10'000 dollars—  as a subsidy. Your guy making 40'000 has 40'000 of income, your guy making 30'000 has 35'000 and your guy making 20'000 has 30'000. If you had no income you would get 50% of the break-even point, or 20'000 dollars. It can be confusing to explain so if you have any questions just ask!",3,0,1444315370,1444726452
