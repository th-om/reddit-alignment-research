We were all trying not to move or make a sound while that was happening, and while the person got a good yelling at by our director, I think most of us would have done a similar thing.",1,0,1444701130,1444721001
cvxnxp2,1,t3_3oiw2c,NOAHA202,"- Reddit is made up primarily of young liberals and libertarians, neither of those groups particularly support political moderates such as Hillary.

- Young people tend to be more concerned with ideals rather than electability or practicality.

- Many young Redditors were simply not old or interested enough to realize much of what Hillary accomplished.

- Little support for Hillary's push on gender/women's issues because Reddit is primarily young males.

- Young people generally don't turn up to the polls.",1,1,1444700831,1444721001
