My girlfriend and I went to see another movie but decided to watch that instead because I had heard it was absolutely miserable (in particular, I read [this review from the AV Club](http://www.avclub.com/review/gods-not-dead-mess-even-christian-film-standards-202571), which begins, ""Even by the rather lax standards of the Christian film industry, God’s Not Dead is a disaster"").

We had to work hard to silence ourselves so that we wouldn't burst out laughing in a crowd of earnestly watching religious people.",2,0,1444508498,1444723131

Although plagiarism is not cool, some of the students who are writing their papers themselves might feel tempted to drop in an acronym for a country's full name without thinking through the grammatical implications of what the acronym represents.

You'd have to say ""*the* Kingdom of Denmark"" and ""*the* Republic of Korea,"" and simply shortening that doesn't change the need for an article. Good luck with what you're doing!",3,0,1444279887,1444723131

cvrjtq3,0,t1_cvrgwfp,no-soy-de-escocia,">If your car was stolen, call the real police. Campus police work for the *university*. You call them when it's late at night and you need an escort to walk you home.

This may be true at smaller colleges, which tend to have toothless ""campus safety"" or ""security"" offices, but larger schools (such as the one OP said they attend) have actual police departments with sworn officers who have full powers of arrest and investigation. If it occurred within their jurisdiction (the campus and typically surrounding streets), they ARE the agency that investigates. OP suggested that this is the University of Tennessee, which does have a full police department. In that case, city police may not even have jurisdiction.",20,0,1444242349,1444723131

Depending on your circumstances, the fact that your UK citizenship is through Jersey might mean that you don't have the typical EU citizen's rights of free movement.
