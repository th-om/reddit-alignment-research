Jindal. Yeah. I'm with you. He is getting zero traction and no money. He may be next. ",6,0,1442937670,1444728784
cv1rs0e,1,t3_3kz61b,only_your_opinion,"Decades?  Anyone tells you anything of what it will look like decades from now are flat out guessing.  That is way too hard to predict in a region that is:

a) unstable
b) valuable to the Western world for a variety of reasons

Typically I would consider ISIS a warlord type structure, which could go on for decades if left unchecked.  But already that has not happened.  (see reason B)  

Plus, there are really too many variables.  

What happens if Iran becomes moderate, or decides to be lord protector of the region?

What happens if or when Syria collapses creating yet another power vacuum?

What would happen if Turkey feels threatened and decides to put it's full weight into fighting ISIS?

What if Israel feels threatened?

Fair question, but for a decades question we are just honestly making shit up at that point.

Does Sanders have a chance?  Chance at what?  POTUS?  No.  (I agree with you, this is not the same as Obama in any way)

Chance at changing the conversation to more progressive issues?  I think he already has and has a good chance of that in the future.

And I think most of his supporters deep down know is the main purpose of his candidacy.  So I think many will not be disappointed if the end result is the primary is a bit more to the left than it would have been if Sanders had not decided to run.",8,0,1442190025,1444728784

He could not find any redeeming qualities and did not find it entertaining. 

While just one person opinion that is a pretty strong reaction and probably the worst thing you can say about a movie.

It stopped the rest of us from even considering it. Word out of mouth is killing this movie fast. ",12,0,1439038271,1444728784
