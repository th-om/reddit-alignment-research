1. Because everything has two sides to it, and to say that: ""one party is dying and in extreme trouble because it is believing in things I disagree with when in reality things are much more complicated"" is ludicrous. 

2. I admit, I did not want to get into a big debate with this topic so I answered some questions in a simple and perhaps overly-relative manner. 

3. Because I already answered a lot of shit, and was -quite frankly- not expecting to write so many responses. I admit, my original point has become muddled and perhaps a little confused as I keep writing. I admit that in my responses, I may be saying things I didn't say originally. 

4. Because most of these things people keep saying have **nothing to do with this discussion**

If this was an abortion topic, I would discuss abortion. If this was a global-warming topic I would discuss global-warming. Etc. 

**This is not a discussion on which Republican views are crazy, or if they are right or wrong. This is a discussion on whether or not the Republican party as a whole is damned because they portions of the party hold views on certain issues and whether or not it is wrong for a political party to support some of the views of its extreme constituents**

> By the way I won't discuss the specifics of my insane viewpoints, because there are no facts to support them. crazy? no.""

Case closed. You want me to debate the side-topics. I don't. I've already spent an hour responding and debating, just because I don't want to go **off-topic** does not mean I'm being a relative ass. 

How about I ask you a random question now that you have to answer to validate your point?

What is your belief regarding the war in Syria and rising American involvement? Please discuss your point and why your point is not crazy?

See? It has no bearing. We're talking about things as a whole, to talk about the little things and to make a response for every time someone briefly mentions a complicated issue in a casual list of topics would take hours that I simply don't want to waste. 

This is you: ""Republicans are crazy. Tell me why they're not crazy regarding their stances on abortion, global-warming, illegal immigration, police violence, war, health-care, gay-marriage, minority-aid...etc. If you don't, I will discredit your point""

I especially don't want to discuss some these issues when people put so little energy into addressing them themselves. Why should I be criticized for not writing extensively on a topic when someone only addressed an irrelevant issue in a mostly-exaggerated bullet point?

I understand that you really hate Republicans and view their views as crazy. Congratulations, however, it is off-topic. We're not talking about whether the specific views are crazy, because talking about these matters warrants entire essays. We're talking about whether or not the Republican party is in as much danger as ""www.progressivechange"" is saying it is in and whether or not it is wrong for a party to represent the views of its constituents, even if others view these views as extreme.

Oh? So what does this mean: 

>Donald Trump will probably be your presidential candidate, an ex reality tv star who thinks Obama was born in Kenya and vaccines cause autism.

It is an indirect character assassination, lumping me as a gun-hoe Republican despite the fact that all I said in my original argument is that there is nothing wrong for the constituents of a political party to be critical towards their elected officials.

He added the rest later, so my ""you"" comments are not in regards to that. I am well aware that the rest of the ""yous"" are in abstract, but the Donald Trump ""you"" was a character-jab. 

Zooicide then goes into a unrelated tirade of comments that are taken out of proportion

>I mean damn, simply acknowledging reality is a political liability in the republican party. You have to not believe in evolution, believe vaccines cause autism, you have to believe almost all climate scientists are wrong about global warming and Rush Limbaugh is right, you have to believe the Earth was created in 6 days 6000 years ago, you have to believe the Iraq war was the right call, you have to be pro war on drugs, you have to be a birther. etc. etc. etc.

Many of these things are not true, or just simply exaggerated. I can pick apart each one. I can make a similar extreme list in regards to Democrats. But it doesn't matter, because **it is off topic**

------------
In regards to your own comments: 

>It is not a good thing that the no-compromise wing of the Republican party currently has so much power right now.

The same thing pertains to the Democrat party. Anyone that disagrees with Gay-marriage, anyone that disagrees with abortion, anyone that disagrees with immigration policies will get little support. It is incorrect to say that Republicans are the only ones with the problem. 

The problem with politics as a whole is that there is no compromise. I do not disagree with this, but I disagree with the notion that it only is present in the Republican party. 

1. I am not saying that it is right for there to be no compromise, but I am saying that it pertains to both parties.

2. In some cases, it is a good thing there is no compromise. What's the point of voting for a political party that does not adhere to it's tennents? 

3. I do believe that it is a good thing that parties are held accountable by their constituents

>Now however, the Republican ideological purity test has several issues and the only correct outcome is 100% agreement with all issues. That's not how a democracy works. That's not how politics works.

The same thing applies to the Democrat party! Democrats that don't agree with the status quo are ostracized just like Republicans.

Do you really think a Democrat that does not support pro-choice, does not support illegal immigration amnesty or whatever-democrats-say-it-is, does not support increased support to minorities, etc would be campaigning with Sanders and Clinton? 

>The Republicans decided eight years ago that they would no longer compromise on damn near anything. 

The same thing applies to the Democrats! No one agrees on anything! Do you think Democrats agreed with everything Bush did? Of course not! So why should Republicans be treated differently because they don't agree with everything? 

This is the crux of the issue, the problem is failure to compromise pertains to **both** parties! However, in some cases this is a good thing because what is the point in voting for elected officials if they are not going to hold firm to your political beliefs? 

What if there was a Gay-marriage candidate who completely stopped supporting Gay-marriage legislation once elected? That candidate would be ostracized the same way Republican candidates are!

Yes, Republican ostracizing is extreme. I agree on that point.

>Look at the grandstanding all the candidates have to do on really stupid issues that are not serious problems. Things like wearing the correct lapel pin.

Applys to Democrats as well! Democrats are more diverse, but in that diversity they are limiting. Go against the diversity and you are ostracized all the same! 

>Things like believing Christians are under attack (they are not)

Republicans pander to Christians the same way Democrats pander to minorities. You know it's true. 

>Remember McConnell's infamous quote: ""[our] number one goal is to make Obama a one-term president."" 

And that is wrong because...? If Trump was president, do you think Democrats would be saying: ""I can't wait to compromise with Trump.?"" No! They would be calling him a racist and sexist pig 24/7!

---------

There is an extreme-right insurgent in the Republican party. This is true. However, one may see this as a proper response to the Democrat party as a whole beginning to move further left as Republicans are now faced with either moving leftwards to match, or moving right to counter. 

The Republican and Democrat parties have changed. Democrats have been moving more leftwards, and the Republican party has become confused in certain aspects: supporting a big military without a big government, and trying to campaign against a unified-leftwards moving Democrat party which essentially polarizes the views of the Republican party making the Republican party look even more right-wards than it is. 

But I don't see this damning the Republican party. 

Trump is running on a surprisingly more-centrist platform, in regards to governmental politics (obviously in the social regard he is right as can be). Carson is black, obviously turning the whole ""Republicans are inherently racist"" on its side. As you can see, there is wiggle-room in the Republican party. 

Ultimately, however, the problem in politics is a two-way street. This is the main take-away. 

Anyone complaining about ONLY ONE SIDE is wrong. Both sides have produced grid-lock in both their arguments, and in their diversive politics. Both parties need to adopt a more centrist approach. There are many far-right aspects to the Republican party, but it's important to acknowledge that the same thing has happened to the Democrat party, and to just attack either party in a vacuum is wrong.

cvvuvdz,0,t1_cvvty1g,Cassus_Caritas,"They dislike Planned Parenthood. Republican voters, on average, dislike Planned Parenthood. So essentially they are doing what their voters want. The fact that they listen to their constituents is a good thing, whether or not their stance is right or wrong is another matter.

This is not a discussion into whether or not certain beliefs of the Republican party are right or wrong, this is a discussion on how to perceive those who disagree with one's beliefs. 

I am a biologist, and I think that some of the aspects of Planned Parenthood are shady as Hell. Does that mean it needs to be shut down? I don't know. But clearly you could see how a Anti-abortion party would take fault with some of the aspects of Planned Parenthood. Does this make them crazy? NO. Does it make them wrong? That is your opinion. 

>Their inability to discern fact from fiction is literally making them incapable of governing

I can say the same thing regarding some Democrat views. 

>Global warming is another great example of that, they believe almost all climate scientists are wrong about global warming and Rush Limbaugh is right, therefore business as usual should suffice and lets defund renewable energy research while we are at it, subsidize fossil fuels, and spend trillions in the middle east cause of oil, ISIS needs more toyotas!

Not every Republican adheres to Rush Limbaugh. Please keep to reality in this debate. 

We are not talking about global warming in this argument. I'm not going to go into it because it could take an entire essay to debate. The point is that you disagree with their beliefs, but this does not make them crazy. Wrong? Yes, but not crazy. 

I can pick apart the rest of the statements, but it's all getting off topic. 

This argument is going in a circle. I do not want to debate topics, because those are off-topic. The main take-away is that just because someone disagrees with you does not make them crazy. Just because Republican constituents are harsh towards their elected officials does not make them crazy. Stubborn? Yes. Crazy? No.

cvvubeb,0,t1_cvvtm1v,Cassus_Caritas,"Both political parties have their crazies. There is an equal balance, you just don't see it because you're on the left. 

From your point of view, far right Republicans are crazy. From far right Republicans view, far left Democrats are crazy. 

Many right-wingers want to dismantle the government. Is this inherently a crazy belief? The government has gotten quite overbearing in recent years, whether it is going to war with countries around the world, being aggressive, or spying on its own people. Many left-wingers will agree with many right-winger sentiments in some of these matters, whether they know it or not. Whether you agree or disagree is another matter, but to label those that feel these sentiments as just being 'crazy' is a cheap easy way out. 

""politicians with solidly conservative voting records who try to compromise in the slightest are viewed as Rinos""

And Democrats that try to compromise in the slightest undergo similar pressure. I admit that the pressure coming from the Republican side is extreme, but Democrats supporting more right-wing compromises have similar pressure. 

""The Republicans have been taken over by the extreme right wing, there is nothing that comes close on the left""

This is just plain ignorance. Because you disagree with their beliefs, you label them as extreme and crazy. 

From a centrist stand-point, far right Tea parties are just as extreme on the political spectrum as Bernie Sanders is. 

""Bernie Sanders? His platform is for us to try moderate European policies""

Your bias is showing. What Bernie Sanders wants to promote has no bearing on this discussion. The policies of other countries has no bearing on this discussion. 

Bernie Sanders, in relation to American politics which essentially is a little more rightwards on the political spectrum compared to the rest of the world, is a far-left candidate. That doesn't mean it's good or bad, it just is. 

He is a openly-socialist candidate, which puts him on the far-left in American politics (I am talking about American politics, not world-politics) just like how anti-government supporters are on the far-right. Whether you disagree or agree on the matters is something else entirely.

cvvtn3f,0,t1_cvvt81s,Cassus_Caritas,"There are too many ""yous, yours"" in your response. My own political backing has no bearing on this issue. I didn't bring my political identity, so just because I disagree with ""forwardprogressives.com"" does not mean I'm some loony Republican. 

Your attempt to damage my argument by attacking me, indirectly calling looping me with ""Republican crazies,"" is cliche' and poor. 

I see nothing wrong with multiple view points entering the discussion within the Republican party. You may believe the Tea Party are composed of loons, and maybe you're right. But it's inherently a good thing that people fight to get their opinions represented by their politicians. Whether the opinions are good or bad are another matter entirely. 

""The wheels are coming off the Repbulican Party specifically""

The Republican party is currently unstable, it's true. But it's not a bad thing if multiple view points get represented. It is, of course, if you disagree with those opinions, but you disagree with the opinion, rather than the representation. 

It's silly to state that the Republican party is the only one struggling in order to indirectly emphasize some point that they are a party of unstable loons. The Democrat party has its problems, and so does the Republican party. Once the Democrat debates begin, then the tensions for the left are going to rise to similar levels over on the right.

It's time all Americans realize that the entire political system is a mess. 

Only saying it pertains to Republicans is nothing but promoting our messy political system, it is nothing but childish ignorance. 

According to the article, many ""crazy"" Republicans question the leadership of their party. Why is this considered intrinsically a bad thing? People are questioning whether the politicians that represent them truly represent them, and this is bad? 

Putting beliefs aside, there is nothing wrong with people questioning their own political party. The entire basis on this article is that the author thinks that the party has been hijacked by crazies which has destroyed the party. I disagree with his crazy comment (certainly there are crazies, but no more than there are within the Democrat party), but I do agree that there is a lot of disagreement within the party, and I disagree with the author that this is inherently a bad thing. 

Now you may disagree on the actual ""arguments"" of the crazies, and that is warrant to another debate. However, the act of the 'crazies' putting pressure on their elected officials and their party is not wrong at all.
