Are you using the Liberal word as in Adam Smith Liberal or Left-Wing. Because, Liberal has never mean left wing it means freedom, the Replibcan Parties Economic stance is Economic-Liberalism.

The Hosts They are Socially-Liberal and Fiscally-Liberal. The propper term for a Left-Leaning person is acually Soicalist in Europe all left-leaning parties are called Socialist never Liberal, while most European Right-Wing parties are party of ""Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists"" which is a coliation of Right-Wing World Political parties supporting Liberalism.


So 

Liberal = Freedom from Government socially and Economicaly

Conservative = Traditional Values, Socialy Conservative, and Fiscally Conservative(Which is the same as Fiscal-Liberalism, except when it comes to government budgets.)

Socialist = Left-Wing 



In North America the terms are rarely used properly. No this has nothing to do with Europe being more ""Left"" wing they have just had a history of theses political parties for an extremly long time 400+ years so they use proper political labeling.
