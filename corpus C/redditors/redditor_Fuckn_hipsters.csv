Why do you think that this would be the results if drugs were legalized. There are countries that have done this sort of thing already and have not seen any significant increases in use for teens and overall. 

Most people would not think, ""well heroin and meth are legal now, I think I am going to give that a try"". People do not do that in areas where weed, a more socially accepted drug, is legal. Also the legalization of weed in Colorado has coincided with [drops in crime, employment and economic booms, and a much better youth prevention program](https://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Colorado_Marijuana_Legalization_One_Year_Status_Report.pdf). It would make sense that crime would drop even further when you start to heavily regulate more addictive substance like heroin. Which is exactly what happened when prohibition ended. 

You idea that a country will legalized weed will turn into one with a culture of inebriation is in no way true based on the data we have from other countries that have already legalized drugs to an extent. Also, alcohol is already a big part of our culture but nobody (almost) is walking around drunk all of the time. Why would this magically happen when drugs are made legal?",1,1,1444677136,1444720313
cvs22qj,0,t1_cvs132v,Fuckn_hipsters,"Thank for the source but this is talking about a specific type of processed chicken. This is quite different than what you said in your OP. You did not specify what type of chicken was being processed in China so I thought you were talking about all chicken. That precooked process shit from China is gross and I wouldn't feed it to my dog. 

That said I do wonder how much chicken is actually used for this purpose. I would think that this would be the vomit inducing ""Processed Chicken Parts"" and even [McDonalds have moved away from this kind of chicken](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/02/06/272112028/oh-so-thats-what-goes-into-a-mcdonalds-chicken-mcnugget). This is for McDonalds Canada and the meat is processed in Ontario. I can't imagine that McDonalds US would operate much differently and a check up by NPR says that much. ",3,0,1444270983,1444720313
cvs107o,0,t1_cvrhxj7,Fuckn_hipsters,"Are you bringing up the horrible inflammatory post you made yesterday? Did you even bother to read the articles you sourced in the post? If you did you wouldn't be asking questions like this. 

These people that are being release either being deported or being held at halfway houses after their release. They are not just getting pardoned either, they are getting an average of 2 years off there sentence. In addition the article that you posted yesterday sighted a study that showed that these people have the same chance of recidivism as they would if they served their full sentence. Meaning the people that are getting released soon would have the same effect on their neighborhood as they would 2 years from now when they finished there sentence. ",1,0,1444269299,1444720313

It would be impossible to ship unfrozen chicken overseas and get it back hear in time to sell at grocery stores or restaurants. Maybe the gross processed frozen chicken patties but OP will have to provide a source for this or I call bullshit. There is enough wrong with factory farms that you don't need to make shit up.

cvrwsf3,1,t3_3nw86o,Fuckn_hipsters,"I'm from Michigan and love the Tigers but the Cubs have been my favorite team since I knew what baseball was. My Grandfather passed away tragically when I was about 6 years old. Unfortunately I don't have many memories of him but. The ones I do have are of me coming home from school and watching the Cubs on WGN everyday while I sat on his lap. The love for the Cubs that started with me over 25 years ago has spread throughout my family. All 3 of my brothers, their kids, and my mom all have fallen in love with the Cubs.

The last time the Cubs were in the playoffs I couldn't help but think of those times with my grandfather. His Budweiser in one hand and me in the other. As I wait for the game to start I can't help but think that I wish I knew him better and grew up to know him as the great man everyone told me he was. Sadly I will not ever get this wish but I can thank him for introducing me to the greatest team and fan base in all of sport... and I can't help but hope I get to see something that he and so many others never got to see. 

...oh and I almost forgot, I cant wait to see baseball played in front of the red ivy.

cvrdxsm,0,t1_cvralor,Fuckn_hipsters,"I agree, I don't like the idea of it being paid annually either. I've been quite poor and I realize how hard it is to budget things that far out in advance. Things like tax returns are great when you are struggling but I would rather have had that money split over the time I was working. I feel that having the money distributed that way would go a long way to relieve some of the day to day stresses (like choosing between food and electricity) of being poor. 

Also, asking someone that has never had money to budget out a large sum of money over long periods of time would be extremely difficult. People would learn but it may take them time to figure it out. ",1,0,1444233817,1444720313
cvrdot9,0,t1_cvrbc8h,Fuckn_hipsters,Thanks for the info. I think I like the idea for NIT a lot better if the payments were made at least monthly instead of annually but I do think would be an improvement on our current welfare system. ,1,0,1444233444,1444720313
cvqp9qm,0,t1_cvqjduj,Fuckn_hipsters,"I understand what NIT is but how would it be distributed (serious question)? I can't seem to find that info online. Will it come each paycheck as kind of tax refund, sent each month/week/pay period separately, paid annually like a tax return, or something else?",1,0,1444175060,1444720313
cvqocwp,0,t1_cvqn9jn,Fuckn_hipsters,">But, also, some areas, specifically parts of the midwest, grain belt, and the south, are easily able to grow pasture and grass, which can be converted by animals into food for us. So ruling out meat altogether gets rid of naturally growing pasture that outcompetes other vegetables.

I live in an area that is almost surrounded by high mountain prairies (about 7,500-9,500 ft in elevation) and nothing but grass grows there. This is because the soil is shit for sustaining crops and with the elevation the grow season is really short. I have also seen it snow in August and while there was no actual accumulation temps around 32 degrees are not good for any crops. This land is used as sustainable ranch land for cattle and sheep.

cvqmv5m,1,t3_3nrio2,Fuckn_hipsters,"I think it's great. It's not like these people are getting full pardons or clemency. They have to petition judges to get what averages out to a 2 year reduction in sentence. On top of that about 2,000 people from that group will be immediately deported. Also the WaPost article mentions a study that finds recidivism rates for drug offenders that are released early are not significantly different than felons that serve their full term.

Seems like a great first step in prison/justice reform. The way we treat drug addicts in this country is horrible and the study mentioned in the article seems to hint at that fact by showing that length of time served does nothing to prevent an addict from using again. I wish state governments would create drug courts like Florida has (can't believe I want a policy from florida) so if these people getting release do relapse they get the help they need instead of wasting away in a cell.
