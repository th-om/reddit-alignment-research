cvj4duc,0,t1_cvis0fc,sulanebouxii,"> However, whenever you give someone money to go to school, **or give money to the school, tuition goes up.**

Could you explain this to me.  I'm just not seeing the logic that govt giving money directly to the school causes tuition to go up.

Surely, as long as the number of students they take in remains roughly the same then the school's cost will remain the same.  If that's the case, wouldn't receiving money directly from the govt mean there would be less cost left that needed to be covered by students paying tuition?  Thus allowing schools to charge less for tuition?

I suppose this logic wouldn't apply to for-profit schools, but I was under the impression that most of the colleges and universities in the US are non-profits.

Seriously, what am I missing here?",2,0,1443606982,1444719793

ct00t91,1,t3_3cxyso,sulanebouxii,"I would point out that the story you linked to said nothing about the Earth cooling.  In fact, the neither of the words ""Earth"" and ""cooling"" appear even once in the body of the article.  Not together nor on their own.  

It only spoke of a strong solar minimum unlike anything we've seen since the 1600s, when at the time there was a 'mini ice age'.  Of course, humanity was pumping out vast quantities of greenhouse gases back then, so expecting another mini ice age during the 2030s is a bit unwarranted.  All of this, of course, assumes that the model they are using continues to be accurate into the 2030s.  

I wonder, if the 2030s come around and this incredibly low solar minimum does occur but the Earth doesn't experience a mini ice age, would that finally lead to the end of climate change denialism?",11,0,1436648569,1444719793
