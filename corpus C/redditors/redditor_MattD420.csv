Uh yes you did

>I don't find basketball to be a very interesting sport.
Doesn't mean I play basketball.

What does that have to do with you saying ""I don't find being in crippling debt because I wanted an education very liberating to be honest."" That clearly says / implies YOU have crippling debt.

>Is that better for you?

Yes, to which I would say if you dont want crippling debt, dont voluntarily sign up for it.

Cars are ""standard"" and cost tons of money. Are we going to make them ""free"" as well?

>You can't expect to get a highschool diploma and have a good shot at landing a job that will support a family of four.

What if you dont want a family of 4?

>Why don't we just make elementary school optional and if you want it, you should pay for it?

I agree 100% with this.

>Probably because most would agree that an education is detrimental to the success of a society

Uhh what?? You might want to look up what detrimental means Mr. education champion. 

>And you can say America was founded on ""this"" or America was founded on ""that"" or whatever other bullshit you want to come up with.

Oh so you must also agree that its a bullshit argument about immigration as well, right?

>Truth is America was founded on democracy


Haha no

>and at the time that might've been what the majority agreed on.

no

>Now we need a change.

Why? Because you dont like the current state?

>If the majority of Americans vote for Sanders and he becomes our president, then that would be what America stands for.

Do you have any idea how our country is ran? Did you take a civics class ever?

>You want financial freedom, move to the Cayman Islands.


Hahah OMG you are a buffoon. So lets see if I want to keep things the way they are I should move. But if you want to change them you should make me move? How about if you dont like it, YOU move?
