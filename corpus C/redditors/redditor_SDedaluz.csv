The point is, no one advances the black man as the face of [Oath Keepers](https://www.google.com/search?q=oath+keepers&num=50&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X) or of [gun rights protesters](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&sa=1&q=gun+rights+protest&oq=gun+rights+pro) more generally.

A black Oath Keeper exercising his right to open carry through a white neighborhood is not likely to be met with encouragement, even from 2nd amendment supporters.  Sure you can find individual staged incidents, but let's try to dwell in reality",-1,0,1444359234,1444716338
cvt9ccm,0,t1_cvt64f4,SDedaluz,"That's a second amendment fringe group that *definitely* traveled to MO expecting to protect two infowars ""journalists"" from (black) protesters - protection they reportedly never asked for.  They make an unfounded claim that their presence quelled (black) unrest in the Furgeson.

They then described, but apparently never carried out, plans to use black residents of Furgeson as props in a beef with the local police chief.  They didn't have to travel to Furgeson to make that point, but they wanted the media attention that videos like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvW_zBvJlsA) don't get.  But somehow they never got around to that important work...",0,0,1444356975,1444716338
cvt85qk,0,t1_cvt7elc,SDedaluz,"My original response was too terse.  The effort would culminate in arrests, given time.  BLM action would be much more effective if they were present to intervene during arrests where black suspects were being mistreated or when black citizens were being unfairly targeted for detention or questioning.  There have already been movements to ""patrol"" at-risk communities with cameras to document police abuses in the hope of seeing officers disciplined.  There are numerous reports of defensive and overbearing police response to such efforts.  I think if BLM activists opted to arm themselves, they would opt for similarly visible patrols.  In the event that an armed individual begins to interfere with a law enforcement officer in the process of arresting someone, you can expect problems.  Making empty shows of force (as in your TX example) will be tolerated (albeit with a heavy police presence in place).",2,0,1444355102,1444716338
cvt7dvk,0,t1_cvt70c8,SDedaluz,"I think the word itself still has power to conjure the notion of the ""un-American,"" but maybe I'm wrong - I would certainly like to think so, since it's been a senseless cudgel wielded by people who have little if anything serious to contribute.",2,0,1444353871,1444716338
cvt75vj,0,t1_cvt6j8g,SDedaluz,"Again, this is well said, however, I would envision selective quotation in the subsequent SuperPAC ad:

> Anyone who has watched the news in the past few years has heard that Obama is a socialist...


> Bill and Hillary Clinton were both socialists...


> I have yet to meet a politician who is not at least a little socialist...


> that's why I don't get offended when you call me a socialist...


> I consider it an honor to be a part of these things that have helped make America great...

You can imagine that footage with ""heartbeat-punctuated"" cross-fades to Stalin, North Korean military parades, hammer and scythe with the contrast jacked to ""sinister.""  And that's kind of my point - unless you were tuned in to the original broadcast or bother to fact-check the commercial on YouTube or pay attention to the protestations of the Sanders campaign, the net effect is probably negative.",2,0,1444353510,1444716338
cvt6l95,0,t1_cvt63g9,SDedaluz,"On the contrary, I think there would be a fair number of voters who are entirely sympathetic to his stance on most issues, but would be quite uncomfortable with an active embrace of socialism.  To a lesser extent these same voters would also get queasy if the question hung in the air and it was not entirely certain which ""American values"" they share in common with Sanders.  It's a set up and an empty label (as Miskellaneousness rightly points out above), but I still suspect this line of attack would move the needle, particularly in swing states with sizable moderate populations.",4,0,1444352578,1444716338
cvt69z8,0,t1_cvt5zpm,SDedaluz,"That's a pretty damn good pivot, actually.  Don't think he'd get it all out before the ""just answer the question"" badgering started, but that's a fine slice of (honest) rhetoric you've served up there.

Edit: and the downvotes...  Was honestly admiring the concise clarity and forthright nature of the response.  I'd imagine some of you saw sarcasm.  Oh well.

And shootouts.

They would be reviled as extremists and murderers from all quarters.  There is no favorable status for a black man with a gun making demands, but that's the net result of two separate double standards: one for what gun owners should look like and the other for what protesters should look like.",11,0,1444351777,1444716338
cvpy7zt,0,t1_cvpvrtu,SDedaluz,"I think the broader point that improbable_humanoid is raising is that present (legal) gun owners benefit greatly from the current market and regulatory system, but bear none of the costs of that system. Those costs are nonetheless very real and the impact is damaging to individuals that are injured.  The broader society also suffers in terms of dollar amounts to pay for the treatment of injuries, the opportunity cost of lost productive life and the tax base that must be directed toward investigation, prosecution and incarceration related to crimes committed with firearms. For gun owners to come hat in hand and ask once again to proceed unencumbered with an enterprise so fraught with grief and expense for others (who likely accrue little or no benefit from the same system) is selfish and irresponsible. If the legitimate use of firearms is so very important, it should be worth some expense and inconvenience to mitigate collateral damage from the present, deeply flawed system by which it is currently regulated.

cvogagq,1,t3_3ni8y1,SDedaluz,"Yet another TC article over-hyping some marginal new development as awe-inspiring salvation or utter doom. The performance of the Internet is amazingly better than 10 years ago, unthinkably better than 20 years ago. The majority of traffic remains streamed video, which IPFS does not address - indeed distributed media hosting (CDNs) and peering arrangements have already decentralized content delivery to a great extent. Modern routing algorithms effectively address the vast majority of shortcomings that IPFS purports to obviate. The author neglects to mention that she is advocating replacing the realitvely straightforward HTTP system with an alternative that is several orders of magnitude greater in terms of complexity. That carries tremendous risk in terms of reliability and security, that of course gets glossed over. But hey, whatever is going to sell her book...",6,0,1444008437,1444716338
