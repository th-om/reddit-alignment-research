>It was in working on this book that he adopted the pseudonym of Frank Quitely (a spoonerism of ""quite frankly""), as he did not want his family to know it was his work, worried that they may have found it upsetting.

His real name is Vincent Deighan. ",1,0,1444718131,1444718998

cvxhily,0,t1_cvxgsi1,Monkeyavelli,"Having your own solo doesn't put you on the A list.  Plenty of lower-tier characters have had solo ongoings. 

>Ms. Marvel and Nova are hardly Triathlon or Jack of Hearts.

No, but they're also not Spider-man.  They're interesting but not top-tier.

This is how it happened in the 70s/80s as well.  The real A listers started leaving and being replaced with lesser characters, so that over time you end up with a squad that includes Triathlon or Jack of Hearts.

The Avengers were supposed to be Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the top of the top you call in when things get really, really bad.  This team is interesting, but that's not this team.",3,0,1444690695,1444718998

That's funny because Charles Foster Kane was a *very* thinly veiled William Randolph Hearst, [and this did not go unnoticed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane#Hearst.27s_response):

>Hearing about Citizen Kane enraged Hearst so much that he banned any advertising, reviewing, or mentioning of it in his papers, and had his journalists libel Welles...


>When Schaefer rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing – or even mentioning – the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire.  The Oscar-nominated documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane lays the blame for the film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst.

cvxgwt1,0,t1_cvx9xoa,Monkeyavelli,">If this movie was about the story of apple, like the social network movie, i would be more interested.

The Social Network wasn't about the story of Facebook anymore than the Godfather was about the Mafia.  Those things were the frames for examinations of larger issues regarding people's relationships and behavior.  If the Social Network *was* just a simple telling of the rise of Facebook it would be boring as shit and wouldn't get the accolades it does.

>Im sure this is a great movie, but I have no interest in Steve Jobs.

Then imagine it's about a fictional tech tycoon because it's really about how obsession with power and control warps you and those around you.

People need to get over their hysterical Steve Jobs hate or they're missing out a great film.",85,0,1444689715,1444718998
