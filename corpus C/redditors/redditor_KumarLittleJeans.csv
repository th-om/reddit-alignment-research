cvwiza9,1,t3_3o9osl,KumarLittleJeans,"Conservatives do not necessarily advocate for laissez faire, even the most libertarian among us recognize the need for some regulation. 

As a Christian first, conservative second, I believe that ordered liberty is a fantastic way to provide for God's people. Free markets allow for human flourishing on a scale that is simply not seen with other economic systems. Free markets do cause more economic inequality, but they also leave fewer people in absolute poverty. 

Fantastic read on this subject for anyone interested: Economic Shalom by John Bolt.",1,0,1444618004,1444716418
cvseuc9,1,t3_3nvb6l,KumarLittleJeans,"I'm assuming that you posted this without knowing what a ""semi-automatic assault rifle"" is, based on the fact that there is no such thing, but instead meant semi-automatic assault weapon - like an AR-15. If semi-automatic rifles with less power than your standard hunting rifle are to be banned in your view, what type of arms would you permit? Muskets?",0,0,1444308945,1444716418
cvseh60,0,t1_cvr52cc,KumarLittleJeans,"There's the elitism I was talking about. Parents care about their kids a whole lot more than bureaucrats in Washington. If schools are accountable to parents, then schools will have to provide a better product, as perceived by their customers - the parents. Right now, the customer is the government, and the only product the government really values is political contributions from the teachers unions. You seem to think that kids belong to the state and not the family, therefore the state, as directed by the elite, should be in charge of kids. That's a fundamental difference between liberals and conservatives. ",1,0,1444308142,1444716418
cvqupk7,0,t1_cvql7z6,KumarLittleJeans,"I have to disagree. When the powers that be in Washington determine how a public school is run, rather than local families, then education policy is being dictated by the elites in Washington. I don't think there is much evidence that the public schools are accountable to the people.  

The most powerful corporations in the world don't have nearly as much power as the federal government. Arne Duncan had more power over education policy than any corporation. Successful corporations typically become successful because of voluntary transactions - they bring more value to their customers and employees than competitors. 

Having the government pick winners and losers is replacing the free choices of ordinary people with the views of the elite. Markets are much more responsive to the desires of the people than are an enormous federal bureaucracy. ",1,0,1444184491,1444716418
cvqhz3m,0,t1_cvpyalo,KumarLittleJeans,"Take education for example. Conservatives would like to see education directed as much as possible by families (which is why we tend to favor school choice, private schools, etc.), liberals want education to be directed as little as possible by families and as much as possible by the government, so that the education system serves the objectives of the state. 

Another example - healthcare. Conservatives favor market based reforms that allow the individual to make her own decisions about how to buy or supply healthcare services while liberals favor a heavily regulated if not completely socialized healthcare system. 

Do you have examples of conservatives wishing to give more power to the elite to direct society? ",0,0,1444163270,1444716418
cvpq9ca,0,t1_cvpm6sj,KumarLittleJeans,"That's an oversimplification. Conservatives are more skeptical of the new and unproven than are liberals, yes, but primarily, they are concerned with the primacy of the individual over the state. Conservatives are more in favor of the spontaneous order of civil society, while liberals want a society directed by the elite. I think liberals flock to the academia because they want to be part of that elite that directs society. Liberals acquired a critical mass at prominent universities and use that power to keep conservatives out. ",-11,0,1444102332,1444716418
cvpq015,0,t1_cvpoor5,KumarLittleJeans,"Absolutely not. Definitely would run afoul of the 2nd amendment, not to mention my Lockean right to self defense. The left would ensure that these insurance policies would price almost everyone out of the market of legal firearms, leaving poor and middle class people defenseless. The criminals would still own plenty of guns and wouldn't bother getting the insurance policy. ",3,0,1444101875,1444716418
cvn3h80,0,t1_cvmvpxd,KumarLittleJeans,"If I understand your argument, it is that we should not put any weight on what Trump has said or done in the past, as he was just doing what was in his best interest. However, we should believe that what he is saying now is what he really believes and not just what is now in his best interest.

Immigration is a big deal, so is the Supreme Court. If we lose the balance of the Supreme Court, it doesn't really matter who is in the White House or the Congress. Are you comfortable with Trump nominating left wing radicals like his sister to the bench for life?

Are you also in favor of socialized medicine?",1,0,1443905382,1444716418
cvmppzb,0,t1_cvmcuml,KumarLittleJeans,"No, I mean least conservative. Conservatism is very much alive and we have a great chance to nominate a reasonably conservative candidate. The GOP hasn't been nearly as conservative as I'd like, just as Trump is not as conservative as I would like. I'm not comfortable with someone who supported Hillary and Obama, who likes socialized medicine, who would appoint a partial birth abortion zealot to the Supreme Court, etc. ",2,0,1443879832,1444716418
