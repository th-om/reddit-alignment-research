cvse38r,0,t1_cvs1wc2,197mmCannon,"Electable or not I can't vote for Hillary. She's just too shady. I know most politicians are but I feel that even in a room full of shady politicians, she's the one hiding in a dark corner. A Trump vs Clinton match up would be the only way I consider voting for her. Any other republican gets my vote against her. I'm not the only one who feels that way either, so not sure how electable she actually is.

I vowed not to vote for another Clinton or Bush but compared to Trump, Jeb Bush looks like the voice of reason.

My ideal election is Paul vs Sanders. We would get some real debate going on where this country is going and how to get there.",5,0,1444307191,1444729597
cvsdhqd,0,t1_cvsa5o5,197mmCannon,"I agree. I'm 39 years old and supporting Sanders. I am not a close minded zealot. I like his authenticity and I like that in general, he just cares about people and being a good person.

I also like Rand Paul and if they both ran against each other I would have a difficult choice to make, but that's highly unlikely to happen.

I don't agree with many of Sanders policy opinions but if he wins the opportunity to run for president then he will be the first non-incumbent Democrat I have voted for.

The same ""force"" that is driving Sanders popularity is also driving Trumps. My friends that support him mostly just say ""I like that he says what he means"" as the primary reason. And they are close minded zealots. Get into a political discussion with them and your going to have to deal with links to isolated incidents of some immigrant charged with murder. It's really quite sad.",5,0,1444305525,1444729597
cvsd6cq,0,t1_cvs4505,197mmCannon,On point 1. I had read on one of those websites that rates candidates in different categories (sorry I can't remember which) that Bernie has a good track record of getting bills passed. Is this not actually the case? ,1,0,1444304544,1444729597

I wonder if it's worth training up now though? It sounds like the tier 9 is recommended but how much do we know about the tier 10 replacement? ",1,0,1442957050,1444729597
