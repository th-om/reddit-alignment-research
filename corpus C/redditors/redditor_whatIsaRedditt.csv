cvxvay7,1,t3_3oheeq,whatIsaRedditt,"Just the fact that we can talk to each other so easily. We've been together for almost 4 years (sophomore year of high school) and are currently going to different colleges. They're close by, so we still see each other thankfully. But I just absolutely love that after 4years of pretty much non stop texting, talking on the phone, and hanging out together. She always does weird shit to make me laugh, and we never get bored of each other",1,1,1444714588,1444717572

cvwomz7,1,t3_3oez4p,whatIsaRedditt,"Los Angeles Kings!!

I'm from SoCal, so I grew up watching the Kings and Ducks, but my dad was always a bigger Kings fan, so I just kinda grew into that.  I think the best way to pick a team is to go geographically. If there isn't  a team near you, then go with a friend's or family member's favorite team. If none of them watch hockey, then go with the Kings! They will have an amazingly dominant run one year, suck the next, do amazing the year after that, it's just so exciting! You'll never get bored as a Kings fan",1,0,1444630742,1444717572
