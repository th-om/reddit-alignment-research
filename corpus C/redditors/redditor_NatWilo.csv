cvwti6x,1,t3_3occsw,NatWilo,"Uhhhhh... This is a thing? I've been using three and four wireless xbox controllers on windows 10, since about day 2 of Windows 10. Or does the krappily writtten article mean 'wireless xbox one controllers'? Because that would be news to me.",1,0,1444650340,1444731252
cvue1ow,0,t1_cvu9vby,NatWilo,Oh they're not alone. Most of the politicians now are cowards too. Terrified to do anything approaching the right thing or see their polls drop and those fat 'election contributions' disappear. ,3,0,1444440961,1444731252

Ps: I remind myself that their 'petty' problems aren't always so.  When you're two and you scrape your leg for the first time, it is the worst pain you've ever had to endure in your life. After a couple thousand, it's just a scrape.  Well, for most people.  ",6,0,1444364753,1444731252

cvtbq0c,0,t1_cvtad9w,NatWilo,"I like to think I do have a better perspective. And I am not worried about it being bad, not anymore. I'm a lot better. Finishing school finally, and thinking about my future, and what I want it to be. Making that happen a step at a time.  :)",17,0,1444361063,1444731252
cvt964s,0,t1_cvt8a60,NatWilo,"It's so much more complicated than that. Some can. Some can't. Some can and then suddenly, after a while can't. Some can't, then can later. Some never do, and that's how they cope, they just see a narrow slice, and follow that slice on through. (This, at least, is my perspsective from the recent war in Iraq.)

I did, and it nearly broke me. Or did break me and I got better? Well it did for a while when I got back. Not during the war, though, I saw most everything horrible a human being could do to another human being, and I understood it, at least mostly. It didn't really keep me from doing what I needed to do to get through it, and I didn't lose my humanity, or stop caring about people, or fall prey to the baser instincts of man. 

It could be that coming back is what broke me. That sudden juxtaposition between the reality of war and the serene 'reality/fantasy' of the home far away that knew practically nothing of what was now the 'real world' to me.",224,0,1444356698,1444731252
