As for now, they're probably just looking at potential experimental changes that may (or may not) make it into the preseason patches.",1,0,1444694548,1444727419

cvtsuiz,0,t1_cvtbzlg,cjdeck1,Tried him out yesterday and was blown away with how strong he is. 30% max hp on a 10s cool down is ridiculous. Like I tried to not kill the enemy so our carries could get the gold. But sometimes it's legitimately hard to do with that W,1,0,1444406101,1444727419
cvtnh7l,0,t1_cvtkyzq,cjdeck1,"Recently started playing him because holy fuck that W damage is dirty.  20-32% max health is disgustingly powerful for that low of a cooldown.  Not to mention if Tahm gets a freeze just outside his tower, landing a W also means your opponent is taking 1-2 tower shots as well",0,0,1444397226,1444727419

cvp8gde,1,t3_3nlxmp,cjdeck1,"Well at least this means we might not have to deal with the snafu that was Azir for so long (although I don't think Kindred is nearly as buggy as Azir was).  

Plus, Iniquitee is right (for myself at least).  I'll be entertained plenty by Worlds until then.",3,0,1444073152,1444727419
