cvxflyj,1,t3_3oi9wl,Hans_Brickface,"I think for some people it's okay, esp. if the thought of an invisible man preparing a place for them gets them off the bottle/pipe/whatever. It's not really ideal, but if it encourages positive change, I suppose it's better than nothing.",-7,0,1444687655,1444716831
cvx4zz0,1,t3_3oh5gz,Hans_Brickface,"Right here :) I don't think my story is all that special, really. When you're growing up in this part of the country, it's like a belief in God is just assumed. But there are a lot of people who talk about being a Christian, but don't really live the life. I recently learned that there is actually a term to describe them: Cafeteria Christians. I'd say there are many more of those where I was raised than there are 'real' Christians. Like, they're always proclaiming things on Facebook like 'We need to get God back in schools', but the only time you'll see them at church is on Easter, if even then.",3,0,1444672276,1444716831
cvx46ef,0,t1_cvx2nje,Hans_Brickface,"> ou mean how liberals scream for freedom when it comes to marijuana, but want government intervention when it comes to health care?

Liberals aren't the ones screaming about smaller government, so your comparison is invalid. They are certainly hypocritical in some ways (like picking and choosing which groups are okay to stereotype and which ones aren't), but this ain't one of them.",1,0,1444671091,1444716831

cvwetpl,0,t1_cvwelmu,Hans_Brickface,"> You'll notice that I actually checked the laws on protected individuals and found that those with physical disabilities are in fact covered. So yes, being called 4 eyes for near legal blindness would cover you as a protected class of individual.

Well, at least it's consistent ...",1,0,1444610576,1444716831
cvwehil,0,t1_cvwe7rq,Hans_Brickface,"> You're trying to compare protected classes of people who have and continue to suffer distinct and blatant systemic and cultural discrimination to anyone with any disability ever. 

No, I'm just pointing out hypocrisy. You seem to think that me getting my ass beat and called four-eyes because I was born nearly legally blind (which happened to me when I was younger) is somehow not as bad as somebody getting beat up because of their race (or whatever other traits you have pre-determined to be 'protected), which I personally find insulting. How do you expect people to be treated all the same when you keep doing things to remind us that we're all different? We already have assault and murder laws on the books. We don't need any more than that.",1,0,1444609931,1444716831
cvwe5iy,0,t1_cvwchfe,Hans_Brickface,"> Better analogy, racism. Beating on someone, as in your example, for the colour of their skin- something they cannot change and did not choose, simply because you don't like them for that, is worse than just beating on someone because it sends a message to everyone like them that they are hated for an arbitrary part of their identity.

What if you beat on someone because they're really short? Or because they're visually impaired and look at people funny? Or because they stutter, or have IBS and fart uncontrollably? Are these all hate crimes? ",0,0,1444609301,1444716831
cvwc62e,0,t1_cvw6qgf,Hans_Brickface,"> Think genocide etc... and how that's worse than just homicide. 

Well, once you get to the point where you're sending millions of people to gas chambers, I wouldn't say the particulars of why really matter. It's not like we're going to give you a pass if you had a really good reason.",-1,0,1444605547,1444716831
