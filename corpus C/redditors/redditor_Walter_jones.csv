Essentially, Iran gets their money back whether or not the deal survives.  It's just with the deal we actually get decent inspections.

For the newbies: **Without the deal Iran gets by far less inspections while at the same time ""getting their money back""**.",2,0,1444693165,1444725307

We're lucky we have the Medical Loss Ratio, Medicaid expansion, subsidies and tax credits, spending cuts for Medicare (would have been insolvent close to now without Obamacare), *not letting companies cut people for being selfish enough to get sick or raise rates because of gender/preexisting condition*, and premiums have been rising at a lower rate 5 years into Obamacare than the 5 years before.

By your logic Russia has absolutely no justification for doing anything with Ukraine.  Logic could also be used to support keeping the Saudi government as is.  No overthrowing government is allowed, right?",1,0,1444683822,1444725307
