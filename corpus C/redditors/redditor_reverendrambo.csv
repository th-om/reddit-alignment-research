http://www.live5news.com/story/30230431/robbery-suspect-fatally-shot-by-customer-identified

Interesting unrelated fact from the article:

> [Police found]the man later identified as [the suspect] lying on his back with a hooded sweatshirt over his head and cinched down around his face. 

This description matches the same that people decried from the Treyvon Martin shooting. Afterwards, [people started wearing hoodies](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/trayvon-martin-shooting-sparks-hoodie-movement/) as a form of solidarity/protest against discrimination, and it boggles my mind that people would defend such suspicious clothing/behavior. 

All this to say, some stereotypes exist for a reason, and they're not intentionally ""discriminatory"" in the political sense of the word. They're defensive. This criminal was caught wearing a hoodie. It's hardly fall here in Charleston and still warm in October. Wearing a hoodie in this weather is crazy unless you're trying to conceal your identity. It legitimately contributes to the idea that that type of clothing, especially in this kind of weather, is suspicious.",1,0,1444676405,1444728876
