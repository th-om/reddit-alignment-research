cvxk96s,1,t3_3oiq9o,JamMan35,"In a classic tabloid move, I predict the Toronto Sun goes Liberal to attempt to capitalise on the newfound popularity of Trudeau. A similar thing happened in the British election - the English Sun endorsed the Tories and the Scottish one went SNP despite them being owned by the same person. 

Nah, that probably won't happen and they'll just write some mania about the Niqab, but it would be funny if it did. ",3,0,1444695173,1444727756
cvwnshl,0,t1_cvwnf8d,JamMan35,"Don't know if Chong is right wing enough for the party. The only way someone that centrist could win the nomination is if they were a westerner like Brad Wall. 

I think it is too early for Patrick Brown, although he'd be a very viable leader for 2023 if he won the ontario election. ",4,0,1444628263,1444727756
cvwnq8l,0,t1_cvwn1e6,JamMan35,"Honestly, I'd be overjoyed if that happens. Someone who can balance the western interests, but keep the party away from the socially conservative wilderness. He also talks with more depth and is more pro-infrastructure than the current party. I've gone Liberal this time, but Wall would definitely have the advantage for my vote. 

Wall against Trudeau would be a hell of a campaign. Throw Cullen in the mix, and you probably have the most experienced and skillful race in Canadian history. ",17,0,1444628093,1444727756
cvwh2q3,1,t3_3oea1u,JamMan35,"Personally, as a Lib/Con leaner (went Liberal in the end), I can completely understand why the Liberals wanted to run him. I think he did a great job in Toronto despite a horrid amount of political interference and vitriol from the Fords. He always seemed composed and a committed public servant. 

I'd vote for Bill Blair in a pinch. I think the G20 response was completely justified - the rioters were committing vandalism and they injured 75 police officers. I've got no problem with a good police response to stop what I regard as complete thuggery. Were a couple innocent people arrested? Of course, but they didn't face long-term consequences and that is the inevitable result of a large-scale operation. 

You are clearly looking at this from the perspective of an ABC voter, but you have to understand that this is a 3-way riding and we aren't talking about young urbanites or students. The LPC has a way better chance of beating the NDP by picking up people like me than by making a play for NDP voters. The NDP pickup was part of an NDP wave and the Conservatives might even be a bigger threat anyway. I doubt anyone under the age of 35 cares that much about the G-20. [According to polling](http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/poll-finds-canadians-support-police-s-g20-response-1.531737), about two-thirds support the response and only a fifth oppose it. 

The polls show that it was a pretty good pick as well - he is winning by a small margin. The polls (40% Lib, 37% NDP, and 21% Con) show that he has won typical Conservatives over. 

> I also find the fact that he didn't outright ban carding under his watch staggering.

I don't think the police chief is actually able to do this. It was done by the mayor, and while he might have influence he is ultimately only meant to carry out the operation of the police force. ",3,0,1444614610,1444727756
cvvkz7h,0,t1_cvvgmg7,JamMan35,">  ""Justin Trudeau is a pretty boy weenie who doesn't take this job seriously"" have been their go to ads all election. 

Honestly, I don't really know if anyone should care very much who leads the Liberals. They've always had a lot of good back room people (like WWF guy and various economists) who make sure their policies make some sense, and the leader remains mostly a figurehead. With Harper it is a different story because he is basically the one man show - the party and its policies are largely his own invention. Mulcair matters because he represents a real split with the traditional party, but Trudeau? It is largely optics in my opinion.

Dion got crushed and he was quite a fine leader, Trudeau seems serviceable to me. I found Ignatieff uninspiring, but I don't think who the Liberal leader affects my vote as much as it does for the other parties. 

In my imaginative moods, I envision the Tory war room as being Lynton, Kenney, and Harper sitting around a table talking over cups of coffee over their statement for the next day and hardly raising their voices above a whisper. The Liberal one would be more like a massive room of operatives managing 80,000 twitter accounts with people shouting instructions and furiously writing various speeches and campaign statements. Plus like 50 people running computer models and arguing over various minutiae. The NDP war room is more like just 100 super angry people yelling at each other and attempting to assign blame for their awful collapse. ",14,0,1444543216,1444727756
cvvkwp0,0,t1_cvvi930,JamMan35,"I'm not someone who usually cares about attack ads unless they are personal or excessively nasty, but you are right that it has been a very positive campaign. I wonder if the Liberals were helped by the early ""Just Not Ready"" attacks because it forced them to do a makeover on Trudeau's public image which was pretty bad even without those attack ads. 

It makes quite a contrast from the quite horrible 2004 and 2006 attack ads they ran. This election has been tame in terms of ads. ""Just not ready"" isn't nasty, its just stupid. ",11,0,1444543000,1444727756

cvvhlmf,0,t1_cvvebgn,JamMan35,"It is the best last ditch attempt really. People love to talk about Lynton with wedge issues, but he himself has said that no centre-right party can win the election if they lose control of the economic narrative. 

The Conservative problem is a singular one in this election; Trudeau has completely taken control of the narrative on the economy. People just believe the Liberals more on it at this point. 

They've let the economic discussion go from financial security and fiscal prudence to creating jobs and stimulating the economy. Nobody cares if they have a balanced budget anymore, because the LPC has made the election about something else entirely. 

Is this partly because of what is happening in the real economy? Of course, but the CPC lost control when they chose security and ""just not ready"" as lines of attack. They are desperately trying to reverse it, but it seems to be just too late. ",29,0,1444535442,1444727756
