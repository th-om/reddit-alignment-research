Even though I personally favor Sanders over Clinton, I have to admit that a Sanders administration would probably look a lot more like a Clinton administration than people think and vice versa. A Rand Paul administration would employ a lot more former Bush officials than anyone would expect based on the rhetoric. 

In the modern day U.S., there is a limited pool of people who have the expertise to run the vast U.S. bureaucracy, and many of the decisions are based more on real world limitations than ideology. That's why Obama, in spite of promising change, ended up appointing so many Clinton people like Larry Summers and Rahm Emmanuel. You are really electing a party bureaucracy not a person. 

So anyone who approves of what Obama did in office should not be too scared of electing Clinton IMO. Personalities aside, Clinton mostly represents continuity with the current approach.",1,1,1444721193,1444722645
cvxx2nr,0,t1_cvxb8nc,fernando-poo,"> It's a common myth that independents decide elections, they don't. What decides elections is how energized each party's base is to actually go out and vote. The party with the higher base turnout wins.

Is there some data to back this up? Looking at the polls from the last election, pretty much all of the far right candidates performed worse than Romney against Obama. I would say it's more likely that Republican candidates are simply responding to what their core voters want in the primary. If they could somehow skip the primary and focus exclusively on the general election, policies and messaging would look completely different.",1,1,1444720298,1444722645
cvwomhf,0,t1_cvt6bh6,fernando-poo,"> EDM first came out in the 70's and in the late 70's Goa was considered EDM even.

Eh what? Early modern electronic music such as Kraftwerk dates from the 70s maybe. Trance didn't appear until the late 80s/early 90s, and goa trance during the 90s.

As far as EDM goes, I guess it can mean whatever you want it to, but people didn't start using the term until the mid-2000s. It's really more of a marketing term that emerged to ride the wave of a new group of artists. I think that's why many people associate it with the more commercial type of electronic music that started being popular around that time.",1,0,1444630702,1444722645
cvwoh6o,1,t3_3oe367,fernando-poo,"He would definitely have the advantage. It's not that Obama is so popular, just that he is more popular than everyone else. The economy was supposed to take him down in 2012 but didn't, and has recovered since then. There have been setbacks on foreign policy, but that doesn't affect most people's lives all that much and polls show while most disapprove of Obama, they also disapprove of intervention in Syria. Out of the other candidates, there is really no one who has outlined (so far) a substantially different policy approach that would gain backing from a majority of the electorate. Since we are throwing out hypotheticals, I would even say he would defeat Clinton again in a primary challenge or in the GE.",4,0,1444630253,1444722645

BTW, I see that they somehow kept Lessig out of the debate even though they have only 5 people. Pretty ridiculous IMO but that probably helps Bernie.",2,0,1444621520,1444722645
cvulv88,0,t1_cvuikba,fernando-poo,"It seems like the net effect of TPP and related treaties such as TTIP and TISA is to move the world towards a system of authoritarian capitalism. Many of the world elite looked on in admiration as countries like Singapore achieved record rates of growth while strictly controlling public opinion and maintaining secrecy about how the government is run. Big pharma also admires Singapore for their strict intellectual property laws and has called them [a model for TPP](http://www.phrma.org/singapore-a-model-for-tpp-negotiators). 

So this new model will be libertarian (as in laissez faire) when it comes to regulation and private-public balance of economy. But authoritarian when it comes to intellectual property, internet freedom and freedom of speech. Measures such as allowing corporations to sue governments in order to block laws that hurt their profits. And enabling governments to censor leaked information in court cases.

OK, so your alternative is a custom CMS. And you think it would take 2-3 developers a week to develop an equivalent alternative to WordPress? Sorry if I'm a little skeptical on this :) ",1,0,1444226015,1444722645

Well of course I didn't say that. There are people who know more than I do but I know enough to recognize that ""code quality"" isn't the sole factor is evaluating whether a CMS makes sense for a project in the real world. You would need to quantify what the costs and benefits are and advance an alternative rather than simply dismiss WordPress because it isn't ""cool"" from a developer standpoint.
