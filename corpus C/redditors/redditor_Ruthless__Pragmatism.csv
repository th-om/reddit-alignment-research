When people care, legislators care. Keep calling and writing your legislators. Have your voice heard.",2,0,1439938934,1444729922
cu7ju43,1,t3_3hhcqk,Ruthless__Pragmatism,"Staffer here, though not in Colorado. As /u/gsfgf pointed out, the bill isn't totally dead until the legislative term ends. However, for simplicity's sake, I'll be forward and tell you that it's 99.99% dead.

The bill was most likely killed because the committee chair didn't like it. The chair of the committee decides the committee agenda, and there is nothing that will literally force them to take any action on a bill.

The 0.01% I'm unsure about is because of what happens in a lame duck session (November and December immediately following a general election). At this time, legislative deals are made to pass certain issues before lawmakers leave office. I can tell you with certainty that this bill will not move for about 15 months. After that, there's a small chance, but I wouldn't be hopeful.",3,0,1439934930,1444729922

The issue is that your compatabilty is based on standalone statements by a candidate, not general discussion or voting history.

It's a better-than-mediocre indicator, but it's not to be taken as testament. I hope that they add a more complex compatability index following each debate.",1,0,1438226891,1444729922

Have you ever actually watched a committee meeting, Floor session, or your state Legislature? These measures come up, but they're filler. There are other pieces of legislation constantly passing in regards to taxes, bureacracy, and private sector regulations to name a few.

Just because the GOP isn't bashing unions and shutting down welfare programs doesn't mean that they are ineffective. If this was the case, I bet you'd just have a different set of complaints.",1,0,1437801376,1444729922
ct3u9j8,1,t3_3dbylv,Ruthless__Pragmatism,"Tennessee has no provisions for state legislator impeachment. Here are some other options:

1. Write their cameral party leader (Speaker, Maj. Leader, Min. Leader, etc.) and leadership team (Speaker Pro Tem, Floor Leader, Whip, etc.) and ask them to bar your legislator from caucus. You may also ask them to remove them from any committee chair positions or committee seats. These are things that most legislature leadership teams have the ability to do.

2. If you identify with their party, voluntarily and/or financially support their primary opponent.

3. If you don't, voluntarily and/or financially support their general opponent.

4. Write letters to the editor for local media explaining their wrongdoing (as far as you are concerned). This can put some heat on them, possibly leading to their resignation. Note: Be careful. If you pursue this option, you're playing against a politician in a politician's game.

Impeachment aside, I know the legislator you're speaking of based on your description. To be fair, he hasn't said anything that is far from normal tea party conservative rhetoric. I don't know if pursuing impeachment will be fruitful if a Republican has already won your district. It's likely another Republican (with different, yet similar thoughts) will take the seat in a special election or by gubernatorial appointment, depending on what your state constitution provides for.",6,0,1436936005,1444729922
ct3p5er,0,t1_ct2zb4f,Ruthless__Pragmatism,"I don't want to push your buttons or anything, but I'm not sure any realistic libertarian candidate is going to run. I would venture to guess that Rand is the most libertarian of the currently announced candidates, and he's currently polling between 6th and 9th place amongst the GOP. 

The only true libertarian that I can see having any shot at making some media noise is Gary Johnson, and he's all but pretty much given up on national politics. Even if he ran, I don't know that he'd get much attention aside from his announcement.",2,0,1436926286,1444729922

Lately, I've been playing an FPS with a large map. We found a guide with the map coordinates to these things I need to find in the game. I give her the list of coordinates, she kind of maps it out and tells me where to go next. All the while, I enjoy playing and she enjoys watching. She enjoys watching most of the time anyway, but I think having her involved makes it more fun for me, anyway.",1,0,1436892631,1444729922
