Like you can prevent them from deciding for themselves who caused the shutdown: the person who didn't sign or the group that produced a budget they knew wouldn't get signed.

Maybe you don't get a ""fighter"" because you pick stupid things to fight over. Pick a worthwhile fight and you may get your champion.",2,0,1444412155,1444721187

Acquittal. Absolute.

Why do people think impeachment means something?

Good documentation? You must be talking about non-python docs! ;)

Just kidding and of course the documentation should give those details but in my experience they usually don't.",3,0,1443665873,1444721187
cvjyuqq,0,t1_cvjf916,dl__,"I love static typing. It's frustrating to to read python documentation where they describe a function in this way:

    doSomething(foo,bar)

Ugh! I know I want to doSomething but what does foo have to be? What does a bar look like? How to I make them? Does it return anything? 

In C++ or Java it would be

    void doSomething(plotz foo, ploop bar)

Ahh! I need a plotz and a ploop and I won't get anything back! What is a plotz and a ploop? I don't know but I'll read the class definition and I WILL know.

cvjdb15,1,t3_3myppd,dl__,"Just a counter example, I've done a lot of C++ and Java but I've been in the Python world for about 2.5 years now and I do NOT Love it.

There are certainly things about it that I DO like but I think generally, especially for large projects, Java is better. Even C++ is better once you learn to handle pointers.

Not to say you're wrong though. Language preferences are pretty subjective. If you love python great. I'm not saying you shouldn't love it.
