cvj748i,1,t3_3mwut5,sirhalos,"Tried it, I didn't find it that useful, in fact I found it worse than using the free version.

Here is the problem with how it is now: 

First off you just use it for difficult words. These are words you have missed only once, or words you have selected difficult. Then you review the difficult words until they are no longer shown as difficult. However, this doesn't really put those difficult words in your long term memory, since you are just practicing them over and over again until they fall off your difficult list. I think you need to get it correct 5~6 times. Next, because you pushed the word off of the difficult list by answering it correctly from rote muscle memory, Memrise now thinks you really know the word well and it will mess up the SRS for the word. Now you won't see the word for days. See the problem?

It would be much better allowing the user to manually adjust the frequency they will see the word for the premium version instead.",9,0,1443616428,1444725227

cvba82w,1,t3_3m0lvc,sirhalos,"I see the example of Sweden, Denmark, etc. a lot from Bernie Sanders and of course I wish I lived in one of those like countries from what they get, but personally don't think it can work here. 

For example, I grew up in a fairly low income area. The high school I went to was about 50% country folk white, and 50% inner city black. Out of the 700 freshmen we had, only 100 made it to graduation. After that only 4 or 5 of us even went to college and I think 3 of us graduated. So we had a situation were people didn't even want to graduate from high school let alone college. They are a lot of people on the social system because of this including my sister. She is even on welfare with 7 kids and gains over $4000 from the system and has no plans to get off of it. Also, on the street she lives on virtually every single individual does not work, gains some type of government check, and has no plans to get off of it.

My biggest question as much as I want to live in a system like Sweden or Denmark, is how does this system handle situations like this that we have a lot of in the United States. How does it handle, Cleveland, east Columbus, Cincinnati, Detroit, south Chicago, south Los Angeles, etc.",4,0,1443013510,1444725227
cvb9fu2,1,t3_3m020n,sirhalos,"The problem is citizens really don't know or understand the size of our military. I don't remember where I saw it at, but random people were asked about how many military bases we have outside the US and most people thought less than 20 and no one asked was even close to guessing the correct number (we have over 700, almost 800). Most people know we spend the most on the military in the world, but they don't really believe we spend way, way more than any other country in the world. If you ask them, okay if the second largest military is equal to 1, how much bigger does the US military need to be for you to feel we are more powerful than them? I think in that case most people would say a much lower number than what it is. Americans just have a false belief that if they remove even a million dollars from the budget that we would now become weaker than China or the UK in military power, which isn't even close to true.",4,0,1443011637,1444725227
cvaar0z,1,t3_3lx5gp,sirhalos,"I never understood for the life of me why people feel they are forced to live in New York City or Los Angeles and hate every minute of it. If you love living there that is one thing, but if you don't, stop. No one is forcing you to live where you are living. My 15 year mortgage is less than your rent and my house is a 4 bedroom, finished basement, 2400 sq ft. Also, my student loans are over double what yours are in something that I will never work in.

I know some people have this belief that the rest of the country is all farm lands and swamps, but it really isn't. They are decent size cities all over that have the exact same chain stores as the rest of the country. Los Angeles downtown isn't even that big compared to a lot of state capitals. It seems people just have an extremely difficult time understanding the cost of living. $1 New York City/Los Angeles does NOT equal $1 some place else in the United States.

You can be an audio engineer some place else in the United States if that is what you want to do or you can do something similar that is close to the field to get you started. All you have to do is move to where the jobs are.",4,0,1442938246,1444725227
cv3ecbp,1,t3_3k6wh0,sirhalos,"I've done something similar to you when I first started out learning Korean with Memrise, but what end up happening was I hit a wall. You will get to a point that you have a ton to water and you don't remember 95% of the words. In the beginning you can learn a lot of new words, but at some point it will be come harder to remember them. For me its around 300~ 500~ words where I start to hit the wall for languages it seems.

Here is what I have done to change past behavior. First look for a course that is based on something. For example: based on a Teach Yourself book (you can pick it up at a library for free), then with Memrise only study the words for chapter 1 (it will usually be in a level for a course), then study the Teach Yourself book chapter 1. No matter how much you want to move forward because you found chapter 1 easy, don't. The key is to know it 100% confidently, not 75% confidently and 15% guess work. Combining the activity of learning the words first on Memrise and then studying from the book will help you remember the words, since you know understand the context.

Lastly, and most importantly I would suggest writing up a very concise plan. For example: If they are 30 chapters in Teach Yourself, you say, okay I am going to finish this in 15 weeks. On Monday I will learn a chapter and then Tuesday and Wednesday I will review that chapter. On Thursday I will learn a new chapter and on Friday and Saturday I will review that chapter. Lastly, Sunday I will review both chapters. Make sure the knowledge you are taking in, you understand very well. Make sure you can say the sentences, know what they mean, and can be able to change them slightly into newer sentences, while using the same knowledge you have done before. Words gained from Memrise by itself will not help you learn anything, especially when it comes to a language as different as Japanese. ",1,0,1442406342,1444725227

cux01zk,1,t3_3kee3b,sirhalos,"Be careful too, because when you do speed review you can miss questions that you know the answer of, but were rushing because of the timer. These misses will count towards your daily misses and will put the word back into a watering rotation. So it is better to just let the timer run out if you are starting to get down to the wire and need to think for a second.",2,0,1441909116,1444725227
