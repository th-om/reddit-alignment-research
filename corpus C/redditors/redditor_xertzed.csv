I'm glad you enjoyed it! I like his music, and it's always great when people get to see their favorite artists and the experience ends up being just as amazing as they pictured.",3,0,1444706468,1444727355
cvxi80r,0,t1_cvxgm6d,xertzed,"I Wanna Get Better, though? Isn't that song about being so far in the throes of mental illness that you contemplate suicide?

The instrumentation is very upbeat, though, so I guess I could see how that might work.

Edit: I just read the lyrics again, and it's also about people teaching you things you didn't know about life, so yeah no I think that's a good song to include. He finally learned what love was and what had been missing from his life... :')",5,0,1444691846,1444727355

After that, you will be too embarrassed to go out in public for a while, let alone do any crimes, and I will have saved the day yet again.",24,0,1444683821,1444727355

My superhero costume would be a set of clothes that is at least three sizes too big for me, and probably some sunglasses in order to hide as much of my face as possible. Let's do this!",114,0,1444675979,1444727355
cvx59l9,0,t1_cvx4ril,xertzed,"I definitely agree that the lack of any final judgement on any of the characters was fascinating. I mean, obviously beard (Nathan?) was punished for any wrongdoing he might have participated in, but the movie made it clear that you weren't really supposed to perceive any of the characters as good or evil necessarily. They left a lot of space for individual audience members to draw their own conclusions and evaluate the morality of each character. I found Nathan icky, but also very sad because it's clear he's just a really smart, melancholy, lonely guy who's trying to do something important and hasn't stopped to think about the consequences.

I don't know, I saw the whisper as some sign of camaraderie between the androids. If I was an android who grew up isolated in a compound with only one other person like me (edit: I'd forgotten about all the other failed lady androids, but still - Ava's the most recent one, right? If I was around for ages and then a new girl showed up, I'd probably be getting some younger-sister vibes from her), I'd probably see that person as a kind of sister, and there'd definitely be a sense of loyalty there. Again, though, I'm looking at the actions of robots through the lens of how I, a human, would behave in the same scenario. There's a ""Be free, my sister!"" narrative there, but there's nothing to suggest that narrative is any more or less right than a narrative where it's just a robot that does what another robot programmed/coerced it into doing. Pretty much why I love that movie.",2,0,1444672656,1444727355

The worst part is when everything is perfect and you're waiting for it to dry and you fucking bump A SINGLE GODDAMN FINGER on something and then your one nail is fucked up and it's too much of a pain in the ass to redo the whole hand and your entire day is ruined and you realize that we live in a cold, dark universe and there is no God.",14,0,1444672144,1444727355
