cvxolau,1,t3_3oi2iy,imthebest33333333,"I think Origen needs to be mentioned here as well. Much like the NA teams they seemed to stick to one strategy which was dismantled in the second week. Luckily they had a free win against TSM to advance to the quarterfinals, but if they want to succeed in a BO5 they will need to diversify.

I don't think it's a coincidence that for the most part, the teams that advanced are the ones that did better in the second week than the first. Even LGD showed up, but it was too late.",2,0,1444701865,1444726748

- Use their last ban on either GP/Morde, which Red counters by banning out the other on their last ban. So they both get two target bans.

- Ban neither, which Red counters by leaving both open and picking a third target ban. Blue first picks either GP/Morde, Red picks the remaining one and one more champion to set up a counter strategy.",2,0,1444633781,1444726748
