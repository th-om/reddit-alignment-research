cvxbbk6,0,t1_cvxazmy,boxerman81,Education is practically elastic by definition.  You need what you need for x job.  Basic education isn't the same as higher in terms of elasticity.  Otherwise everyone would be running around with a PhD.,3,0,1444681340,1444717636
cvxb4c4,0,t1_cvx04po,boxerman81,"The West isn't really changing as much as the playoffs appear.  It's the same few teams (apart from the warriors and lack of thunder) mixed around since about 2011.  In no particular order the top teams have been the spurs, thunder, rockets, grizzlies, blazers, Mavs and clippers for nearly half a decade.  Yeah a different set of four manages to make it out every year, but it's almost always been them, with the warriors replacing the nuggets the past couple years.  The rest of the conference has been by and large shitty, though the teams on the cusp of the playoffs seems to constantly jumble as well.",23,0,1444681064,1444717636

cvx0153,0,t1_cvwztol,boxerman81,"Do you actually think most people that are prolife do it to strip power away from women?  Seriously?  Most prolife people take the position that abortion is *murder*.  I'm not prolife, but I certainly understand the reasons why people are.  

I won't pretend that people who are for outlawing abortion aren't telling women what they can and cannot do, but it's absurd to think that people do it solely because they don't want women to have power.  There are tens of millions of prolife women.  I'm sure plenty do fall into the sub servant housewife role, but I'm also sure plenty do not.  ",8,0,1444664691,1444717636
cvwy18r,0,t1_cvwxrak,boxerman81,"I honestly doubt that.  Until now, once you got to a stamina amount that isn't a waste to stone at (I'd say 150 is the minimum), there was really no reason to focus ranking up.  There's just so much stuff to do in pad.  You have to purely try to rank up to actually get 400, because that is a shit load of runs that are dedicated purely to rank xp.  There's no way anyone nonIAP gets to rank 400 within a year, unless they're willing to play 12hrs a day during 1.5xp events (which I don't think will be that common).  ",5,0,1444661290,1444717636
cvwxx3m,0,t1_cvwxsap,boxerman81,"Oh I can, I'm just saying I don't really play for ranks anymore.  I suppose now that 400 means something I could, but I'll get there way before this comes to NA.  I'm just saying that rank 400 is by no means nothing.",5,0,1444661085,1444717636
cvwxrar,0,t1_cvwvhgb,boxerman81,"Rare Evo machine is probably better in terms of stamina, just with a higher variation.  The thing is you can easily guarantee 6 super king+'s for 88 stam.  A single blue mask is 100 stam, and a trifruit is 150.  ",1,0,1444660794,1444717636
cvwxlgz,0,t1_cvwxdcu,boxerman81,"Bruh... I'm moderate IAP for a while, play every day, and stone for stamina often.  I won't deny that I don't really run coin dungeons and haven't run KotG at all since I got to maybe 180 stamina, but I'm only rank 386.  I'm currently at about 42.5m xp.  Running pure KotG, that's about 3000 runs.  With a mediocre to decent team, I'll give you 4 minutes a run with re entering the dungeon included.  That's 12000 minutes,  or 200 hours of pure KotG, not including skill ups or Evo mats or challenge dungeons or descends.  Unless you play like 4+ hours of pure pad a day, you're completely wrong.",15,0,1444660502,1444717636
cvult9m,1,t3_3o5lvj,boxerman81,"Hardest lead IMO.  Anubis and Ra can just run with 10 time extends, and it's really not that bad.  This lead takes a ton of forethought as well as matching skill.  Seems confusing as fuck.",4,0,1444461694,1444717636
