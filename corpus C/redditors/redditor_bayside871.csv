It is to late to make that kind of change. TSM could prove us wrong and just 4-0 out (highly unlikely),  I just think they need to take more risks in unison, and they will probably pull out a W or  2.",1,0,1443894582,1444728000

cvhrmkx,0,t1_cvhq6r4,bayside871,"IDK a lot of people say this, and it is true. At least they are honest and upfront about it. Do you really think that it would be any different? The state would have to give growing licenses, for farms. Who is to say a business just doesn't buy them by putting money in our state legislators (literally every successful business does this). Here is what could happen, a grower could sue the state of ohio for not being able to sell in ohio. They would most likely win due to past legislation (Ohio nor any state cannot regulate interstate commerce). Unless the court rules that prohibition is in itself illegal. What we will get is ""imported"" weed from colorado and other states. It isn't so bad, and I will put up with a monopoly for a little bit until this becomes the reality. The important thing is that is has failed in the past, this time it has a lot of money behind it, and will probably pass.  
  
TL;DR wait out the monopoly for other legal states to sue Ohio for the right to sell their product in Ohio. Previous federal rulings favor this. Another good thing to come from this, would be a straight answer from the feds as to whether marijuana is legal or not federally.",2,0,1443500829,1444728000
cvgbhtj,1,t3_3mm910,bayside871,"This year will be all about the games you just mentioned, with probably a focus on overwatch and SC2. Probably a show about WoW legion, and HS.

This is one example. It is something that effects both sides pretty evenly.  
  
Even more important than lobbying is the scandals such as this:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal  
  
For profit prisons are a result of neoliberalism (turning public industries into profit). A lot of more moderates follow these principles (mix of socialist planning and capitalism by providing subsidies to businesses willing to do a government job).  
  
I think I did a good basic job of explaining how, economically why not so much (no new markets to expand businesses is probably the biggest imo)
  
Edit: The fair sentencing act is also a huge glaring example of stiffer sentences through lobbying. (notably the crack cocaine reduction part) To clarify, it is an inverse. Previously the sentences were much harsher, and overtime it was revealed that it might be a bad idea to follow the ""for profit prison lobby""",3,0,1443031665,1444728000
cvblext,0,t1_cvbkapw,bayside871,"I get what you are saying however your attempt at saying longer sentences doesn't explode the population is moot. Think about that. People are in prison longer, so if those people are there longer, it will cause a rise in prison population, even if crime rates remain the same. (i.e. people are there longer, so overall there is a higher population)  
  
It depends on the state as well, Kansas is hardcore about drug charges due to a huge meth problem. People break the law all the time, however it is more common for lower income people to commit more crime. They want more, or an alternative to their current situation. So in effect, anyone in the middle class loves the cops, they protect their shit, the poor see the police as a threat to the possibility of escaping their situation (drugs), or making more money (theft/drug dealing etc.). This is pretty generally the understanding, and why it is such a divide.  
  
Perhaps the biggest problem is not with sentencing, or for-profit prisons, it is those repeat offenders you mentioned. Perhaps if we were able to devise some sort of actual rehabilitation, instead of cultivating criminals. That is what I base my argument on. The prison system is simply not effective in its current standing, and when you have a growing lower class, and a shrinking middle class the problems become bigger as everyone just wants to ""get what they deserve.""",1,0,1443031016,1444728000
