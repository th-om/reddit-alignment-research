Some people are okay with ending on a high note, and others are okay with trying to keep a good thing going even if it means they might (or inevitably will) fail. And I'm honestly not sure which I prefer.",1,0,1444427890,1444727006
cvh1bhh,0,t1_cvf4y5d,TheRiff,"An ongoing Kung-Fu? I'd throw a lot of money at Marvel for that. Easily my favorite tie-in.

I also liked Armor Wars, but oddly enough it was the Spider-Man and Kingpin stuff that won me over, not the Iron Man stuff.",1,0,1443458991,1444727006

cvb9opf,1,t3_3m0u1n,TheRiff,"I don't agree at all. It's not *their* subreddit, it's a subreddit for the fans of them. 

I think when people mess with fanspaces for fans of their work, it causes a lot of messy splits and arguments with dishonest defending of things because fans think it's what ""they"" want.

Fans getting upset about Suzy saying the grumps don't visit the subreddit is, to me, the biggest thing to make the main sub go to shit. If they did participate more obviously, given their PR track record and the fanbase, it would only be a matter of time before something bad happens.",4,0,1443012264,1444727006
cv9f1yd,1,t3_3lu3ji,TheRiff,"I hate when stories set in space basically turn space into a dive bar with uglier biker gangs. No space-specific problems, no cultural misunderstandings, no big epic anything happening. Just ""whoa the aliens in this bar look mean"".",24,0,1442867980,1444727006

cv6at43,1,t3_3lgny5,TheRiff,"My slogan ""I'm Sick Of Everybody's Shit!"". I might clean that up into ""A Fresh Start For America"" or something.

My platform would be to fire, force into early retirement, or remove from office every single person that I can as president, through both official power and political persuasion. I'll start with those who have the most power and work my way down just enough to make the cleaning staff start to get worried. If I win, I will resign from office rather than run for a second term. My resignation speech will be titled ""That's The Last Time I Clean Up Your Mess"" colloquially known a the ""fuck all ya'll"" speech.",3,0,1442610564,1444727006
