cvwnycj,1,t3_3obs0j,Mjolnir2000,"The first book is absolutely brilliant, though it takes a couple chapters to really get going.

The second book I thought was a little weaker. Still darn good, but not quite as much happened plot-wise as I was expecting after the way things ended in the first one.

Haven't started the third book yet, but I'm super excited.",2,0,1444628708,1444722765

cvucaz7,0,t1_cvubjcs,Mjolnir2000,"Nothing wrong with skepticism. The problem is that your side has gone far, far beyond skepticism, and is now just ignoring overwhelming scientific consensus for political reasons. Science should be left to scientists, not politicians, and until the scientific consensus changes, the only sane default position in the political arena has to be ""this is almost certainly happening, so lets figure out ways to address it"". Right wing conspiracy theories don't contribute to the conversation.",2,0,1444437473,1444722765

When capitalism thrives certain people who see the benefits get fat and have smart phones. The people growing that food, however, can end up starving because it gets shipped around the world to be sold at low prices instead of being used to feed the people who produced it.",3,0,1444425788,1444722765
