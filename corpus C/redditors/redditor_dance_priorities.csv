When you look at the data between the actual source, its materially different and you can't find out what they actually did.  That isn't acceptable. 

Look at their Board.  Its all political science people and career labor union men.  Look at their 'economists'.  It has one 'economist' that worked for unions and then zero people that went to school for any field related to economics.

Can you explain this as well?  It seems that they aren't doing that on a federal level, again its a state's rights issue.

>plus the us would likely have been in at least one more war not sure that meets any definition of being just fine

Can you also explain this?

You put two qualifiers that infringe on that yourself.  And you ignore the long tax stamp process to obtain them and the rules of ownership.
