cvv8aag,0,t1_cvu693r,IlliterateJedi,"In my opinion, it's silly to 'stock up' on things without a plan.  It doesn't do you any good to buy up a lot of expensive items (coconut oil, almond flour, xanthan gum, etc.) if you don't have a plan for it.

Eating keto usually involves eating a lot of fresh meat, cheese and leafy vegetables.  Cauliflower is a keto staple, but there's no reason to stock up on it.  Just plan ahead for whatever you're going to cook and get what you need.  You will acquire a pantry full of goods over time.",2,0,1444517725,1444725345
cvuzsr6,0,t1_cvuz8n2,IlliterateJedi,"My (poor) understanding is that bioperine uses up or blocks the process for metabolising modafinil so it stays active for longer in your body. However it works, I've found it makes modafinil extra effective. ",1,0,1444502007,1444725345

cvrsqu6,0,t1_cvrshkv,IlliterateJedi,I would highly recommend creamed spinach. Bulletproof coffee would be good too. Cauliflower mash as someone recommended. Chicken salad could be easily chewed if cut finely and not overcooked. I'll let you know if I think of anything else. Flakey fish like tilapia. ,2,0,1444255465,1444725345

cvp7h9k,0,t1_cvp6yla,IlliterateJedi,"They're free to look at other sources of income all they want.  I'm disappointed that they looked at a monthly subscription, and then decided that it was the right decision.  There's really no strong argument why a piece of software like YNAB needs to have a subscription based system aside from greed and wanting to force your users into an indefinite plan.

I would rather pay $60 for my license for life.  If a monthly fee is the only way YNAB is offering their service, I would rather see them go out of business than support it.",-1,0,1444071696,1444725345
