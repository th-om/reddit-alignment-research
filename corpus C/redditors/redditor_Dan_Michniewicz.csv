I would venture to say that it's because especially during recessions--a pretty common occurrence in our economic system--intentionally running a deficit is a good way to stimulate the economy and overcome a liquidity trap.",1,0,1443989262,1444720592

Also, republican and D's beholden to the financial sector fought pretty hard against the Frank-Dodd financial reforms.

Really not hard to find examples of republicans railing against regulations and then taking action to back up that rhetoric once they are elected. Not saying that they aren't joined by certain D's, though.


>taking less is the same as giving something

tax cuts lead to reduced revenue for the govt and more money in pocket of the tax payer who the tax cut applied to. Seriously not tough to understand how these two things are comparable.

>Walmart and the Walton family receive tax breaks and taxpayer subsidies estimated at 
more than $7.8 billion a year

Here's a primer on the republican platform:

-deregulation, specifically of the financial and energy industries
-reversal of a once progressive tax code
-union busting
-privatization of once public services.

You seem like a smart person, though, so you'd probably get a better picture of what US political parties stand for by doing the research yourself rather than asking random redditors, though.",1,0,1443975490,1444720592
cvnksb9,1,t3_3nfasd,Dan_Michniewicz,"""Bush Jr. handed Obama a $1.4 trillion deficit. Obama has reduced Bush Jr.'s deficit to just $492 billion. But tell me again which is the party of fiscal responsibility""

That's the google return on a search for ""obama deficit"".

The deficit grew after the Reagan Revolution. Clinton reeled it in. Bush II blew it up again, and it since has decreased. Republicans love to talk about fiscal responsibility, but tax cuts for the private sector and the top income tax brackets lead to reduced revenues, increasing deficits and ultimately the national debt.

cvd1s96,0,t1_cvd1dbt,Dan_Michniewicz,"Eugene V. Debs. Five time socialist candidate for president. Got about a million votes in 1912. Gave a speech in Canton, Ohio denouncing US involvement in WWI and was sentenced for 10 years for discouraging people to enlist in the draft. He then ran for pres from his cell in 1920. Was pardoned by Harding after that.

I think the closest he ever came was in 1912 when there were the dems, repubs, debs's socialist party, and teddy roosevelt's bull moose party. Political landscape was definitely strongly progressive. Three nominally ""left"" candidates. The Debs strategy was to use a presidential candidacy to drum up support and excitement for socialist candidates at all levels of govt. Kind of what Sanders is talking about. Not saying that they are super similar as far as policy goes, but that same strategy there. 

""I am not a Labor Leader. I do not want you to follow me or anyone else. if you are looking for a Moses to lead you out of this capitalist wilderness, you will stay right where you are. I would not lead you into the promised land if I could, because if I led you in, some one else would lead you out. You must use your heads as well as your hands, and get yourself out of your present condition. as it is now the capitalists use your heads and your hands.
