cvnuwpi,0,t1_cvnkqjw,mpez0,"> if the products really are better, why not let the marketplace decide?

By all means, let an equal marketplace decide. Non-GMO foods could be labeled as ""lacking the benefit of additional engineering"" and GMO foods could be labeled ""with improved features.""

Is it possible that mandating labels tilts the marketplace?

cv010p6,0,t1_cuznz1n,mpez0,"No, the justice department said she was within her rights to delete her personal emails. There is no public evidence or indication (other than her assertion) that the deleted emails were all personal; therefore there is no public evidence that her actions were legal. When someone says ""Officer, I wasn't speeding"" that's not considered proof they weren't speeding.

That is precisely the reason for the policy of having separate accounts for personal and official messages.",0,0,1442155484,1444729735

cutqocg,0,t1_cutk46s,mpez0,"The Secretary of State is, in classification terms, an ""Originating Authority."" That mean it is one of the few positions that is granted the authority -- and responsibility -- for determining classification. Most of the people who deal with classified information can only derive the classification from rules  and decisions set forth by Originating Authorities. Part of Clinton's duties as Secretary of State would include deciding what should and should not be classified. Her saying ""but somebody else didn't mark it"" is like her saying ""someone else should be advising the President on foreign affairs, someone else should be administering the Department of State,"" and so on.

Those emails that are now being found to be classified? It was her responsibility to note them and have them properly dealt with. Of course, she could only have done that on an accredited email system -- which her home server was not.",-1,0,1441656220,1444729735
