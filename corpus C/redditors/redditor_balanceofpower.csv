cvxygff,0,t1_cvxufnq,balanceofpower,"I've read about the bellybuttons being censored with reference to Lee Meriweather in ""That which Survives"" but what's weird is that twice (possibly more) there were episodes in the same season with female characters with exposed navels. So either the censors were very inconsistent or perhaps the execs were just giving Roddenberry a hard time.",1,1,1444725960,1444726240

cvxtcsx,0,t1_cvxofw9,balanceofpower,"Very nice answer, thank you! As a followup, does this mean Kemp/Vinken put to rest the feminist theory that the heart symbol is symbolic of the female vulva / posterior then? Do either address this theory in their work?

(for the record I have nothing against feminist theory or feminism in general, I have been somewhat skeptical of this claim ever since I first heard it.)

cvxhul1,0,t1_cvcfa8e,balanceofpower,Love that episode especially because  that was Chris Latta playing that role.

I don't know if seasons 1-2 are necessarily *bad* - yes they get more hate than they deserve (and yes there are weak episodes) - it's just the later seasons, especially during and after Best of Both Worlds that the show really takes off. Those episodes showed what TNG was capable of and, as a result, makes what came before it look hokey by comparison.

Personally I enjoy seeing the arc of a show's development, not just the story arc of the series but also how the writers developed as the show progressed. Few shows start off with a fully fleshed-out characters like today's long-form drama. I like seeing the early versions of Picard & Co with their rough edges. It's also fun to pick up on small details or nuances that were dropped or developed as the show went on.",1,0,1444690552,1444726240
