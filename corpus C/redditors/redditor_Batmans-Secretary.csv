cv5we1a,1,t3_3lfngf,Batmans-Secretary,"He did poorly.  I'm sorry but Kasich does best when he plays the sturdy leader to the crazy Republican opinion makers in the field (Trump, Cruz, Carson, Huckabee, and Walker).  What was with his answer about Israel?  It sounded like he'd support a religious war.  It wasn't the moderator but it was Kasich's answers.  He was aiming for low hanging fruit and seemed to forget that people like him because he doesn't take the easy conservative answer.",8,0,1442588189,1444727188

Honestly I agree with most pundits that Carly Fiorina  gained the most ground.  Her rhetoric was spot on, she could dive into specifics, and she exchanged punches well.  The only time she slipped was when Trump went after her on HP's business history. She looked ashamed when he brought up the deal with Cannon. Other than that she looked and sounded great.  

Carson gained ground in that he didn't have a deer in the headlights moment like he did last debate.  He sounded more firm in swinging to the right.  Still I think he went untested because every candidate on stage literally avoided attacking him, despite being the number #2 highest polling candidate.  Which I was shocked at.

A lot of us on here, myself included, don't really understand why Ted Cruz does so well in these debates and campaign trail.  It's because he's the most adamant, rhetorically sounding conservative on stage.  Ted Cruz literally made the point that he'd take the government over the edge to defend his conservative principals.  Many on here don't understand that there's really conservatives out there who feel that conservatism is constantly under attack from liberals, democrats, and RINOs.  Ted Cruz reassures you that if he's elected conservatism won't go anywhere. That's why he gains.  He did well.  He knows who's watching, who goes to vote, and who matters for these next upcoming elections.

--THE WASH--

People saying Rubio sounded great--I gotta disagree on this one.  He tried to do what he did last time, and I honestly don't think he nailed it as hard as he did last go around. He seemed frustrated that despite his best answers (Foreign Policy wise) he sounded like he still had the title Senator swinging around his neck.  He did well enough so he wouldn't lose, but he didn't do well enough to where he could gain.

Walker didn't do nearly as bad as the first debate, but he didn't do as well as he should've.  I bet on Walker.  $200.00 to be exact, that he'd be the nominee next Summer.  The phenomenon is amazing, on paper Walker is every conservative's wet dream.  He's a governor, outside Washington, Evangelical, took on big Unions, and won a conservative agenda in a blue state.  But that doesn't translate because the guy is using slogans and phrases that Republicans used in 08-14 elections.  There's nothing new, no spark, not a single droplet of creativity and it shows on stage.  Still he didn't hurt himself during this debate, but more importantly he didn't help himself either.

Christie was struggling.  Last debate he came off as petty.  This time around he tried way too hard to shift the narrative.  He only wanted to make this debate and primary about the Democrats.  Meanwhile he's forgetting that there's 15 other people standing in his way before he can go on to face Hillary in November '16. When he was hitting his marks he did well.  Entitlements, working class families, and a little bit about having to get things done.  He was well there.  Still he relies way too much on the Prosecutor bit.  There's no difference between him and Rudy in my opinion.  That won't sell well.  He didn't hurt himself here, but didn't help himself.

Kaisch is a fan favorite around here.  Last night he wasn't as good as he was in the first debate.  Especially when he brought up the Judeo-Christian bit about the Middle East.  Kaisch is in his element when he can contrast himself as an effective leader not as someone who get people's fire going.  When he tried to do that, twice by my count last night, he fell flat.  It just doesn't seem authentic like it would coming from Rubio, Cruz, or Fiorina. He may've helped his brand in NH, but he didn't really expand so he didn't hurt himself but didn't help himself I thought.

---THE LOSERS-- 
 
Biggest loser of the night without a question is Jeb.  Jeb looks so frustrated by Trump it's a running joke now.  He came across so annoyed that he has to compete against Donald Trump.  He doesn't even know where to start.  He's awkward against him, he doesn't sound authentic, and he's not inspiring. Jeb's element, as I think, is against other politicians.  Had he been facing someone with a smaller ego he'd be slaughtering them.  Going against Cruz, Rubio, or Walker, Jeb knows how to attack.  Put him against Trump and he has no idea how to handle someone so outrageous.  Jeb failed hard.

Once again people should be asking ""Why is Huckabee still here?""  We waited almost until the end of hour 1 to hear Huckabee speak, and it was about Kim Davis.  That should be a red flag to anyone in his camp, or supporting him the guy is operating on one set of tracks.  He doesn't belong on the stage and you can feel that everyone there knows he doesn't.  He doesn't out conservative Cruz, he doesn't out religious Carson.  So what does he bring?  His brand is washed out by other candidates occupying the stage.  Pretty soon some billionare will ask Huckabee for their money back.

Rand Paul is another favorite here.  But guess what, his rhetoric, and his beliefs don't line up with the current Republican electorate.  People think he's a strict constitutionalist, but he's not the right kind of Republican.  This guy advocates for lessening the burden on foreign policy.  He's not advocating for increasing the US's military strength.  Disagrees with the everyone on stage about drug policy.  And is at odds with everyone on civil liberties. Rand Paul is up there to just elevate his brand and it shows.  He's getting a free ride and he'll be back in 2020 barring some political scandal, or a Republican win. Again he got beat up last night.  He's not his father, who knew how to swing during a debate, and knew how to take a punch.

--THE DONALD--

I personally think Donald fumbled last night.  But again those polls will prove me wrong.  I think there's a chink in that armor now though.  Walker had one the best lines against him saying we don't need an Apprentice.  He should followed up with that the election isn't about you Donald, it's about the American people.  That's a line that would've drew applause, and hit him hard.  Carly smoked him with her face retort, and she put him in his place anytime afterward too.  

Trump does get a slight bump because he made Jeb, Rubio, and Christie look like flustered.  Sure, essentially he was name calling, but the responses from those guys were weak.  Trump literally punched them in the mouth and what'd they do?  Pushed up their glasses and rolled their d20's to see if the riposted the attack. 

I think if I had to put Trump somewhere it's be in between The Wash, and  The Gain section.  He gained in that he's still the biggest charismatic person on stage. His supporters believe he's a winner, and he hasn't sold himself as anything else. However he goes into the The Wash for me too because at one point the man defended Progressive Taxation system.  I don't know how long he can keep that dance up without Mark Levin, or Laura Ingram not noticing what he's saying.  

So that's what I thought.
