Apparently it's grayed out for a lot of people, but grayed out in the ""on"" position.",1,0,1444619349,1444724451

cvwi6wr,1,t3_3oehmy,xiefeilaga,"This is ""ripe"" puer tea. Puer is a type of tea grown in Yunnan Province and often pressed into these cakes and various other shapes. When properly stored, it can be aged for many years. The ""ripe"" style has been fermented in a way to approximate the flavor of aged tea.

This tea is usually best gongfu style. To separate, use a dull knife or letter opener. Stick it in from the side, trying to get between some of the leaves, and gently twist to pry the cake apart. The goal is to try and pry it apart without breaking too many leaves. You can just pull chunks off in this way as you drink. Some people like to break the whole cake down at once, but I don't bother.

Find more information at /r/puer. There are also quite a few knowledgeable dealers hanging out there.",13,0,1444616582,1444724451

cvvfkt9,0,t1_cvvagvr,xiefeilaga,"The betamax thing could lead to some interesting conversations. Technologically speaking, betamax was superior to VHS in many ways. It just lost the market battle, at least for consumers. TV stations and other industries that rely on video continued to use the beta format until everyone went digital.",5,0,1444531526,1444724451
cvverqm,1,t3_3o900n,xiefeilaga,"It's primary for a lot of people, at least in terms of little things, especially among old folks. Most people will give Western medicine a shot for the big things, but are always supplementing Western treatments with TCM. It's a really big thing to try to counter the ill effects of chemo with daily doses of TCM, a practice I think is very dangerous.

Also, when you go to the hospital and get an IV, the doctors will often mix TCM stuff into your IV without telling you.",3,0,1444529985,1444724451

Basically, you're looking for soft inserts you can put in your shoes that hold up the arches a bit. They also cut down a bit on the impact of running.
