cvxbnxw,0,t1_cvxbf9n,lamabaronvonawesome,I don't find pants beautiful but I really want to posses them. I don't find money attractive at all and I REALLY want to posses that. I can think of a million things I want to posses and don't find beautiful. I don't buy your logic.,2,0,1444681826,1444728066

cvv2lhv,0,t1_cvv241c,lamabaronvonawesome,"Yep, but we have economies based on never ending expansion rather than some form of stabilization with room for people to get rich or just be OK within that framework.

cvv2hm4,0,t1_cvv25zj,lamabaronvonawesome,I think a stable number is what to shoot for a constant expansion is impossible. We will have to stop having babies on earth at the rate we do eventually. It's a no brainer.,1,0,1444506973,1444728066
cvv2gyr,0,t1_cvv26op,lamabaronvonawesome,Huh? I never said a word about communism or lack of democracy or freedom of expression or religion or speech. All I talked about was a shift in focus into different areas due to automation. It's like when we discovered agriculture and freed up a large part of the population from hunting and gathering. What then happened was science and innovation and art. Why would having basic goods and services taken care of be communist? That is crazy.,0,0,1444506940,1444728066
cvv206v,0,t1_cvv1sgv,lamabaronvonawesome,Population stabilization will be required in the future and there will be jobs just in different areas. It's like when we discovered agriculture all the hunter gatherers didn't just stand around.,1,0,1444506079,1444728066
cvv1w0g,1,t3_3o8i0f,lamabaronvonawesome,I can't see how you can bomb people and only hit combatants. Seems ridiculous to even think that is possible no matter what happened in this particular incident.,7,0,1444505863,1444728066
