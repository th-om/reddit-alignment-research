> NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FanDuel Inc. (www.fanduel.com), the largest one-day fantasy sports operator, announced it has closed $275 million in Series E financing, bringing total capital raised to $363 million. The oversubscribed round was led by KKR with **Google Capital** and **Time Warner Investments,** together with Turner Sports, also joining. **A number of NFL and NBA team owners** participated in the round along with previous investors, including Shamrock Capital, **NBC Sports Ventures**, **Comcast Ventures**, Bullpen Capital, Pentech Ventures and Piton Capital. 

The people who make money off sports are directly involved in these things. By daily fantasy getting more popular, they only stand to make more money, not just off their investment but because more people watch the sport. Fan duel and draft kings get people who couldn't give a shit to watch stuff like baseball and hockey and other sports with low viewerships. 

Also, if you can't tell, there are a lot of powerful people involved, I doubt regulation will happen anytime soon if ever.

I can respect the fact that you openly admit that you are okay with taking the life of a living being because the mothers autonomy trumps the life of an unborn baby. I disagree with that conclusion and think of it as murder. But at least you are consistent in your logic. ",0,0,1443720192,1444721805

which is odd to think that a woman's choice as to whether or not she wants a child has a direct effect on whether or not a fetus is a living being. 

Seems backwards, like it should either not be murder and abortion be legal, or be murder and abortion illegal. Or, if you want it to be considered a living being, at least admit that your are killing it, but you think it's okay.
