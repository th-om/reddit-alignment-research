It's already that kind of area and if you want to stick with Pripyat, just used the material for SOX and change some names.",2,0,1444697650,1444719615

cvxl32g,0,t1_cvxjxpc,HeloRising,"It's not necessarily the ideals underpinning the world as much as it whole-cloth parts of the story.

The actual place Tomorrowland is basically Galt's Gulch; there are five original founders, it's a place where bright scientific and artistic people go to work free from interference, it's hidden from ""ordinary people,"" and the people who live there are generally uncaring about what the people outside do to themselves.",5,0,1444696474,1444719615

cvxjp47,1,t3_3oinmr,HeloRising,"Eh. I know sometimes biology doesn't cooperate and if that's one of those nights I tell my partner it's time to pull out the toys. I still have fun and so do they. A lot of times I'll find my body more cooperative a bit into messing around with just toys.

The important thing is not to beat yourself up over it. Sometimes it happens. If your partner is giving you shit for it that's incredibly rude (unless you're into that).",2,0,1444694254,1444719615
cvxjbn2,0,t1_cvxie0y,HeloRising,"I'm not sold on the idea that the director is trying deliberately to make Objectivist philosophy films however if you put *Tomorrowland* next to Atlas Shrugged there are some *very* strong similarities. It's to the point where I have a hard time buying that it wasn't intentional.
