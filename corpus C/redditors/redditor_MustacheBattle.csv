The top 1% makes about [17% of GDP (20% of income).](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/the-rich-get-richer-through-the-recovery/?_r=1) With Bernie's proposed programs (so far) we'd reach about 45% of GDP spent at all levels of government (35% today and another $1.8 trillion per year from his plans, GDP is about $18 trillion). Yes, I understand that the health plan involves money that's already spent through private means, but taxes still have to be levied to finance it.

Even if Bernie took 90% of the income from the 1% (15% of GDP) he'd need to find another 30% of GDP which will come from the 99%. That would result in average effective tax rates of 44% on the 99% of earners. This is also only including recent proposals, nothing beyond single payer and fully-subsidized university. If additional benefits are passed taxes would have to go up even more.",11,0,1444688427,1444719777
