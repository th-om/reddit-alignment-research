cvovriv,1,t3_3nitix,cassius3000,"Auto insurance above the state minimum.

Many state minimums for auto insurance are long overdue for an update. The minimum for property damage in Florida is $10,000. Do you really think $10K is going to cover you if you hit a mercedes or a BMW.

Perhaps this doesn't qualify under the 'almost nobody has' requirement. But anybody who peruses r/legaladvice can attest to the fact that more than a few people get caught with insufficient coverage for their accidents.",3,0,1444052477,1444727588

At some point shortly after this the entire family was going somwhwere in a limo and there was some sort of protest going on and some guy broke through a police barrier and was pounding on the window and giving the finger. (EDIT:: Wow that's a triple run-on).

Reagan, without missing beat, gave him the thumbs up sign and then turned to Ron and said ""see it's already catching on.""",2,0,1443803080,1444727588

If you fund tax cuts by taking on a shit-ton of debt, you are running a back door stimulus program. Only you don't get the traditional benefits of a stimulus effort like infrastructure upgrades, the ability to target stimulus spending in regions with high unemployment and being able to 'unwind' the stimulus program without a political dog fight.",1,0,1443003288,1444727588
