cvsl9xh,0,t1_cvsji7n,discuss___politics,I can't see it working the other way. I can't see protections being passed before they observe a culture change. They wouldn't see any incentive at the time. ,3,0,1444319849,1444726792
cvsjac8,0,t1_cvsj079,discuss___politics,"I work with massive alcoholics and pill poppers but they're fine because alcohol isn't viewed poorly and the pill junkies have prescriptions. And they come in all fucked up or hungover half the time, calling out, showing up late, falling asleep or even getting sick on the job and that's all fine to them. It's a fucking joke. 

One of them drives a forklift into something and they come out just fine. One of then drives a forklift into ME and I'll be drug tested if I require medical attention and if I smoked anytime recently, I'd be fucked even though I was stone sober at the time. ",14,0,1444316870,1444726792
cvsiriu,0,t1_cvsid9o,discuss___politics,"That's the hangup for me. Even if it was recreationally legal in my state, I wouldn't risk partaking unless my employer changed their policies. 

Currently, assuming it was legal, they could still fire me and although they don't actually do random testing, if was involved in any accident or injury (even if I'm not at fault) the first thing they do is test you. ",15,0,1444316054,1444726792
cvrm1na,0,t1_cvrjlas,discuss___politics,"Right, it really makes absolutely no difference except for what it shows on the registration website. It just still shows your old party until after this November election. That's it, just clearing up confusion and reducing panic. ",3,0,1444245569,1444726792
cvq7hp4,0,t1_cvq56v9,discuss___politics,"Thanks for that. I never would have thought of that and that is something I could easily imagine our government doing. They've already shown such blatant disregard for the Constitution when investigating crimes that my biggest fear with any kind of ban or seizure of weaponry is that it would result in a new ""war on drugs"" situation.

cvq53wx,0,t1_cvq4s5b,discuss___politics,"I understand that last part, and I don't pretend to have the answer on how to stop mass violence and crime. Someone said legalization and treatment programs for drugs and that makes some sense to me. Reduce the need for crime and territories and the need for guns to to protect those illegal activities is reduced. ",2,0,1444144292,1444726792
cvq4xtg,0,t1_cvq4oal,discuss___politics,"Well, like a learning permit. Like we do with driving. To reduce the risk of someone untrained accidentally causing harm to themselves or others. ",1,0,1444144016,1444726792
cvq4jqr,0,t1_cvq3h2l,discuss___politics,"What if there was something like a learning permit that allows you to only use a gun with someone else who's licenced until you obtain a licence yourself after passing a safety test? Something like what we do with driving. Or what if guns had a title that can be signed over to someone who already has a license when trading guns?

Disclaimer: I'm not well versed on the topic of guns. ",-2,0,1444143379,1444726792
cveoikb,0,t1_cvenf2x,discuss___politics,"But what if they're not both falling down, not moving but still ridiculously drunk? What if both people are can't-think-straight drunk but still doing shit and walking (edit: more like stumbling) around? Been there. Was at a party with just a small handful of friends and my buddy's wife and I got frisky. It progressed all the way to sex before a mutual friend found us and put a stop to it. Afterwards, we were both led to the living room  before she and I took turns running to the bathroom to throw up and we both eventually passed out. 

We don't know how we let it happen (besides being ridiculously drunk) and we both definitely regretted it. When our friends stopped us, she was on top. So which one of us should have claimed rape? Regret does not equal rape. We were both too drunk to tell our urges no and flirting quickly led to sex in our very inebriated state. Did we make a series of bad choices or were we both raped by each other? ",3,0,1443262911,1444726792
cvb9jbo,0,t1_cvb2rrl,discuss___politics,"I do think there is a ""not your typical candidate"" appeal to both of them that draws supporters among the common people. ",2,0,1443011890,1444726792
