He defined the rules and the penalties. If you are a believer, then everything in this world operates as it does simply because God said so. ",6,0,1444106364,1444721551
cvpq3mw,0,t1_cvppkoc,Klar_the_Magnificent,"That's a much broader issue/question that is very deserving of focus and obviously this incident was dependent on us being in the current situation in Afghanistan. However, I'm simply saying that given the situation we are now in, these types of incidents happen. The only guaranteed way to prevent them is to remove ourselves from the situation entirely.",2,0,1444102053,1444721551

God: ""There must be a sacrifice for me to forgive the sins of man, so I shall sacrifice my son""

Person: ""Why must there be a sacrifice?""

God: ""Because I said so, it would be silly for me to just forgive you""",5,0,1444101436,1444721551
cvppfpd,0,t1_cvpozla,Klar_the_Magnificent,"Mistakes were made. Did the US have some sinister motive to bomb a MSF hospital? No. War is a terrible thing because terrible things happen in them. How many horrific things happen daily in these war torn areas? We should absolutely investigate to try and prevent it in the future, but I'm not shocked when things that happen regularly (civilians killed) in war actually happens. It is sad and tragic just like war is.",2,0,1444100942,1444721551

cvpowcl,0,t1_cvpoku2,Klar_the_Magnificent,"""it/they"" as to mean if the enemy force is using the building. It was a tragic accident but close air support is a tough thing. If troops on the ground are reporting they are under fire and need air support there is a rather tight time window and you have to balance target verification with protecting the lives of the soldiers on the ground. War zones are chaotic places and there is no perfect way to prevent incidents like these.",6,0,1444100066,1444721551
cvp7vu4,0,t1_cvp24ja,Klar_the_Magnificent,The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been going on since the mid 1900's. Obviously there isn't violence on the scale of say Syria but it has been ongoing for a very long time. ,0,0,1444072301,1444721551
cvodoav,0,t1_cvnedzs,Klar_the_Magnificent,Just to note oil is a global commodity. Just because we get the bulk of our supply from elsewhere doesn't mean that disruptions in the middle east won't effect energy prices here in a potentially drastic way.,1,0,1444003672,1444721551

cvjqeti,0,t1_cvjjeo5,Klar_the_Magnificent,"Use science for their ideological goals? As in they push an ideology backed by scientific research and evidence? Do you feel oppressed when presented with facts that differ from your world view?

I'm fine with school choice. If you want a deeply religious school experience for your children you are free to choose and pay for that. Public schools however should stick to teaching facts not perverted by the views of any religion.",2,0,1443645947,1444721551
