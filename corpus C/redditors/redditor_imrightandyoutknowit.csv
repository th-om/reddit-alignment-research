Now operating off the assumption that as a natural born citizen they will spend a significant part of their life, if not their entire life in the United States, the poll numbers you posted don't mean much as they reflect what Muslims in mostly non-developed world countries believe. Muslims in Egypt or Bangladesh are not going to hold the exact same religious interpretations and beliefs as Muslims in America.

Even then, the Southern European Muslim countries, which are the most ""advanced"" or Western poll less extremely than the other countries in Asia and Africa. That isn't even getting into *literally the next section of polls* where Muslims overwhelmingly support democracy and religious freedom.",1,0,1444594731,1444719475

cvw2azk,1,t3_3ocezz,imrightandyoutknowit,"One of the most interesting aspects of the race for the Speakership is how both Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy (as well as already ousted Congressperson Eric Cantor) were members of the Young Guns, a clique of conservatives that promoted Tea Party/conservative politics in the House. I can certainly see the comparisons between Jeb Bush and Paul Ryan in that Bush is conservative relative to the American populace, but not in comparison to the GOP base. 

It's obvious Boehner's retirement and McCarthy's dropping out hurt Bush, who is the standard bearer for the establishment GOP in the race and now lacks a critical ally to make the case for why he should be president. At the same time more conservative presidential candidates like Cruz, who has a history of meddling in House affairs, can back far-right candidates for Speaker. If successful, Cruz (or Carson/Trump/etc.) can make a case for why they should be the GOP nominee and not someone of the establishment like Bush",2,0,1444589900,1444719475

Well, within the past couple of decades, racism has crept it's way into political discourse disguised in economic messaging and it certainly wasn't liberals that got that ball rolling. And even then plenty of liberals today paint opposition to welfare  as a class issue.",2,0,1444232931,1444719475

cvqgh4c,0,t1_cvqectn,imrightandyoutknowit,"In India, when the British colonized, they banned the practices of sati, when wives would throw themselves upon the funeral pyres of their deceased husbands. Say what you will about colonialism and the destruction of cultures that results from it, but that was clearly a good thing that happened. Just because something is embedded in culture is a shitty reason to keep something around. Slavery and racism were (and still are to a lesser extent) pretty important parts of Southern culture.

Very few major policies in the United States immediately go into action unless it pertains to a national crisis so I don't know what your point of stating that was. Considering how comprehensive and far reaching Obamacare was, would you consider 2014 to be immediate when the law was passed in 2009?

> You say ""some gun control like background checks,"" but Oregon has some of the strictest background checks in the nation. The shooter had to pass a NICS checks, which includes mental, criminal, and other information, including FBI background check. This stuff is already done. It ain't working.

It's almost as if background checks aren't a magical cure for our national ailment of gun violence. Hence why I proposed a combination of things that, together would help combat the problem. ",1,0,1443968928,1444719475
