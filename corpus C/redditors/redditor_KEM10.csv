But I guess I am, I did get a coffee maker specifically so I didn't have to drink work coffee.",3,0,1444685046,1444718486

The person who sold me mine had a very long speech about how it isn't real espresso and that the end result is in fact coffee and not an Americana. I couldn't even begin to repeat it, but you can make it as strong or weak as you want.",1,0,1444683313,1444718486

cvx5h8f,0,t1_cvx485x,KEM10,"The question on how to have multiple splats in the same game pops up regularly and there's always one person who chimes in to warn about its potential issues, I'm just that person today. I also don't know how versed you are in WoD so I'm starting from the beginning. There are two major issues when it comes to mixing splats: balance and lore.

Would a Hunter know what a Changeling is and that it's just a magical, runaway slave, not necessarily a threat to humanity? Would the Changeling trust the people that it use to know while its Fetch is potentially around? How much does someone with supernatural powers trust to use them around people going after other supernatural creatures (this is actually a fun question to play out in different Hunter groups)? These are the lore questions for your group. This you can easily hand wave if you so choose (what I'm gathering from your comment), but the game will have a very different feel.

Each splat was designed on its own to be played on its own. This has lead to a non-existent balance between the systems and completely different rules for each group. A Hunter with the proper time and resources might be able to take out a few Vampires or Werewolves, but in a direct fight those same Hunters will lose every time. The Changeling could face the Vampires in social combat, but both would have their work cut out for them physically against Werewolves. And then the Mages would come in and rewrite time/space and destroy the whole world simply because they can. Your game would probably look like ""The Changeling Show with guest stars 2nd Sight dude who spends twice as much experience for half the power, and the Hunters who just fuck about trying to seem relevant"". This is also why I suggest everyone be in the same splat, no one would drastically overpower everyone else.

This isn't me saying ""Don't do it."" This is me warning you that it might not be your best choice and giving two options on how to make it a better experience overall.",1,0,1444672962,1444718486
