They guy who declares that it is the people through Congress who declares war, and not the executive branch? I'm just not seeing it sir.",12,0,1444494251,1444722205

Almost all multi victim mass shooters have a very similar ideology, they want to harm as many people as possible because our sensationalist media will turn them into demigods. They crave notoriety, some validation of their meaningless existence. They want to feel powerful and in control possibly for the first time in their lives. They pick on the defenseless so they can be arbiters of life and death, if only for a short while. That is why they are cowards.

If these evil cowards were attacking people in a position to fight back (say, a SWAT headquarters), they would still be evil and selfish human beings, but not so cowardly. ",1,0,1444063312,1444722205
cvmt35j,0,t1_cvmpu7y,Yumm_Yumm_the_Man,"I disagree. The first step towards tyranny is to disarm the people. Stalin did it, China did it, the Nazi's did it (to Jews and places they conquered) Cambodia did it, Turkey did it (specifically to the Armenians). Now, it is true that not every place with strict gun control has had genocide, but it is also true that disarming the populace makes domination of that people much easier. 

They also have tanks, ships and airplanes cruise missiles and weapons of mass destruction. If the US government wanted to wipe out the civilian populace they could with biological or chemical weapons. However, wiping out the entire populace is a pretty terrible idea. No one to produce or control, no one to work the resources or maintain infrastructure. What is far more common throughout history is taking out groups of people, usually along ethnic, religious or political lines. To take out one group and control the rest of the population, brute force can only to do so much. Take a look at present day Afghanistan, where an armed and motivated (also brutal child raping, woman repressing monsters) rag tag populace is still resisting the most powerful military thirteen years later. And remember, Afghanistan is roughly the size and population of Texas. The entire US military and law enforcement combined wouldn't be able to effectively control Texas, not to mention the other 49 states at the same time.

Now, even though we have the natural right to keep and bear arms protected by the Constitution, we still rounded up Japanese Americans and put them into concentration camps during World War II. ",1,0,1443887372,1444722205
cvmswsl,0,t1_cvmldw5,Yumm_Yumm_the_Man,It's far more difficult to herd Jews onto a train car to Auschwitz if they are armed. It's harder to have the KGB murder you and your entire family if you can fight back. ,1,0,1443887017,1444722205
