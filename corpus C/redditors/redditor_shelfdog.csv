cvxiluy,0,t1_cvxdye3,shelfdog,"I'd say that you would have a very short career as personal experience is no replacement for actual training.

Producers know who has training, who works regularly and who is in over their head. Pros hate working with folks who have no training - their habits are bad and technique is lacking and it takes longer to work with them which costs $$.

You get one chance to make a first impression. If you are serious about your craft, you won't half-ass it and hope you are learning the right things on the fly.",3,0,1444692468,1444727782

cvx6bsq,0,t1_cvx4k18,shelfdog,"Acting behind a mic is a talent and learning proper mic technique is very important. However, I suggest you always continue in regular acting classes as this is the basis for everything. I still take scene study and 99% of my acting work is VO. 
 
Remember - it's all still acting, but with subtle differences. Just like Theater Acting is different from TV Acting is different from Acting on Film. You adjust your performance to the medium. 

As such, I'd also seek out a once a week Beginner VO class or even an occasional weekend workshop that is for beginning VO to explore the basics and get you comfortable enough to find a coach to go to to refine your mic technique and skills. 

Finally, I always suggest studying for 6 months before considering a demo, but I know that many don't have that patience or cash flow.  

Good Luck!",4,0,1444674182,1444727782
cvx5ivj,0,t1_cvx1w8d,shelfdog,"You deleted the previous post and your description in the main posting where you said it was a fact that Chelsea and Jennifer's teeth were identical. That is an opinion.  Erasing the posts and rephrasing your statements doesn't change that.

Why did you erase those posts? Why not leave them up and own what you wrote?

I laugh when someone does that because it gives the impression they were wrong and now want to hide. I also laugh when folks correct grammar and ignore the point behind it. 

You are cracking me up.",1,0,1444673029,1444727782
cvx1doc,1,t3_3ogm9g,shelfdog,"Find a class or a reputable coach who can teach you. It is not something you just ""pick up"" after buying a mic. 

In fact, buying a mic before you ever take a class and see if it is for you is the worst thing you can do. I know many a wanna be voice actor who blew big$$ on mics/software, etc and never took classes. 

They now have very expensive equipment they rarely use or don't know how to use because they do not have the talent to attract auditions and work. Or it's a waste because they found out how hard the business is and they don't want to work that hard. Hell I know 2 wannabes who HATE to read, but wanted to be VO performers. It doesn't work that way. They sold their equipment at a loss.

Either way, find a coach or a class first.
If after those first 6 or 8 weeks, you still dig the idea, THEN talk to your coach, etc about what equipment to buy, what it takes to put together a professional demo, etc.

And don't chase voice work if you think you do ""good impressions"" or someone said you have ""a great voice"". No matter how good you *think* your impression is, there are 5 pros who can destroy your best impression in their sleep. 

Bottom line: 

Talent is key. That's why training is so important - to develop and increase your talent.  Then drive. Then Business acumen. A ""great voice"" is a distant fourth among working professionals in my experience.  No matter what your voice sounds like, you can work steadily if you know what you are doing.
