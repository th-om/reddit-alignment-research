That response was pretty killer though, I laughed really awkwardly out loud at that.",3,0,1444709818,1444726944
cvxt2w5,0,t1_cvxsywu,PMeIfYouWant,">""Actually fits in the context of the subreddit"" is so far down the list it's irrelevant. 

I agree with that.

I don't see the issue here? It's not like you could just post a photo of a rock and it would hit the front page of /r/funny. More people liked it than disliked it, that's all there is to it. The proof is in the voting, just like how I was downvoted despite following rules, because people vote on what they like/dislike (whether they should or shouldn't). 

People liked it so it's here. It's not like OP is breaking some high standard of sanctity. ",3,0,1444709368,1444726944

cvsy3aa,1,t3_3o0dg7,PMeIfYouWant,"Both the best and worst thing is people, you don't have to worry about friends, you will definitely make friends here if you come. Some people are really really friendly. Some people are really not friendly. Higher percentage of both than where I came from. Don't know about the quality of elementary school sorry.

Summers are okay, a bit too hot for me (up to 105, mostly 96ish, fairly humid sometimes too), winters are GREAT except for sometimes there is a lot of cold rain or ice. Schools shut down from a snowflake sometimes, and sometimes they will keep college open when there is ice on the sidewalk and road. Greenville is close enough to have a day trip to the beach or friends in the triangle. Everyone sucks at driving and traffic is noticeable during rush hours. Not great, but not bad.",6,0,1444338455,1444726944

Fire Andy 

Start Kolb. Mcnabb is fucking done he *literally* only hits dirt.

Why didn't we draft Earl Thomas?

It's time to get rid of Akers.

It's time to bench King Dunlap for someone who doesn't commit so many penalties.

Although to be honest the Eagles are only one game back, I'm certainly not happy with the team, but it could be a lot worse. It's not a wash yet.",0,0,1444187235,1444726944

Also you look like you could be every ones secret crush. Attractive while being modest, the room setting convinces me you have an interesting personality, and I'm also convinced you have a smile the world wants to see.",12,0,1444106583,1444726944
