You can give me this bullshit about ""religious obligation"" but  most of the millions of people had no business being there and by going there they prop up Saudi Arabia and directly support its violent and barbaric regime.  If this was not a ""religious activity"" the Hajj would be quickly branded as a crime for facilitating terrorism. So please, spare me the ""religious obligation BS""",-15,0,1443364047,1444723806

cvfpxaw,1,t3_3miybd,twimo_lap,"Lots of misplaced cat love in these down votes. It sounds like you knew your cats were trespassing on your neighbors property and yet you continued to allow them outside. There is no ""theft"" or ""animal cruelty"" when you should have been protecting them by not letting them wander. Your neighbor shouldn't have released them into the wild, but if your cats are untagged he could have have just assumed the cats are feral and he doesn't want to deal with them anymore. So please, don't be a cat owner if you can't be a responsible one.",12,0,1443357262,1444723806

cveiu8h,0,t1_cvei7yj,twimo_lap,"Pizza with its origins in Italy, like German and other origins for hamburgers and hots, has been radically changed by its adoption in the U.S. Pizza definitely originated in Italy and was originally brought to the U.S by Italian immigrants, but a culinary revolution about what is ""pizza"" occurred when pizza increased from just what Italian immigrants ate to pretty much all Americans ate. I'll leave this to a culinary expert/ food historian to further answer. But you'll see a spark difference between what is considered ""pizza"" in Italy and Sicily as compared to the broad difference of American ""pizza"".  

So like hamburgers and hotdogs, there is a clear European origin of pizza, but a quintessential American identity has developed. And, (forgive me for pushing the modern history barrier that is present in this sub), American chain pizzas have been essential in defining what ""pizza"" means on the global scale.",5,0,1443240807,1444723806

These people were nominally tied to the mainland up until the 1800s but were part of Japan for many decades, and now have been independent for 70 years. To just assume that these people should have to accept Beijing's authority is reckless, and dare I say very offensive to them.",3,0,1443224063,1444723806

Once he leaves his speakership, even if he did stay, none of the Republicans will care about his ideas, and Democrats won't have anything to gain by cooperating with him. He'll just spend 2016 collecting a check and providing a vote for the Republicans. I'm not sure how Ohio works, but his district is heavily Republican, and Ohio has a Republican governor and a Republican state legislature (both houses), so there is virtually no chance that his district could change parties. So given that, him leaving will not hurt the party whatsoever, and leaving now on his terms leaves a much better legacy, and terms on becoming a lobbyist.",6,0,1443218241,1444723806
