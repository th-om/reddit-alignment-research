cvkn1c1,0,t1_cvjxpwu,ridersderohan,It's also pretty easy to make. [Instructions here](http://www.houzz.com/ideabooks/3454588/list/diy-make-your-own-chalkboard-paint),1,0,1443717014,1444723167
cvkmxjt,0,t1_cvkjig8,ridersderohan,"The confusion is that vous (or tu) in this context isn't the subject. If it's je t'aime, that's saying I love you (or really I you love). Same with vous. Since you isn't the subject here, it's still conjugated for I. I love you. 

It would conjugate for the vous if you were talking about what the vous was doing. You could say ""vous m'aimez"", or you love me, but who says that?

People learning French early on can get pretty easily confused by just conjugating the verb for vous since it directly follows vous but that's not the case here. 

In terms of formality, it's somewhat rare to say Je vous aime outside of the context of loving a group. To love someone is a pretty personal and intimate thing. You would never say je vous aime to your boyfriend unless you were being passive aggressively cold. There are some kids that address their parents as vous but that's increasingly rare.

cvkmldj,0,t1_cvkdbxk,ridersderohan,"Great question. I have no idea. Probably pretty similarly though. The romanized alphabet for Vietnamese actually does pretty well with sounding how it's spelled in my experience. But then again, I've just learned it that way so I guess of course it would make sense. Pronounced correctly, it actually does sound how it looks. There isn't much at all of the silent fifty letters and you only pronounce 1/15 of the word like you see in French. ",1,0,1443716435,1444723167
cvk4g78,0,t1_cvk4aaw,ridersderohan,"You'll almost certainly be able to get by. Especially in big cities. I'm hesitant to feed you the same line a lot of people give about big European cities about how everyone speaks English. Certainly a large number of people speak English extremely well for a country where it's not the language. But, like you see in this video, a lot of people have limited control. They can certainly understand quite a bit and engage and it's all very impressive, but certainly not everyone is fluent. 

It's good to learn the basics at the very least. France might get the worst reputation for this but it's certainly annoying to have someone approach you in your city and speak to you in another language with the expectation that you'll just understand. 

It's best to learn as much as you can. You'll certainly ""get by"" with just English and the basics. But it'll be difficult to make meaningful friends outside of other ex-pats (not at all impossible, but certainly more difficult). 

Then again, I'm not Spanish. I go a lot but I'm French-British-American. :/",16,0,1443669381,1444723167
cvk49s5,0,t1_cvjses2,ridersderohan,"Since there seems to be a lot of confusion here and in general: the way Nguyen is pronounced in Vietnamese uses sounds that are either 1) extremely uncommon, 2) not used in the same sequence ever or 3) simply does not exist, in other languages. Obviously it's easier for some languages (East Asian languages etc). Want to try? Sure! [Here's a link with it being pronounced!](http://forvo.com/word/nguy%E1%BB%85n/#vi) A common issue though, is that the sounds are sometimes so uncommon that a lot of people can't hear the difference between what it is in Vietnamese and what they're saying, kinda like how a lot of people can't ""hear"" the tones in tonal languages (like Vietnamese!).

So given the huge number and dispersion of the Vietnamese diaspora, what's a young Michael Nguyen or Fran√ßois Nguyen to do? Find a close and easy alternative. That's not always consistent though. In France, at least, there is a ""standard"" pronounced En-gooey-en. Not at all close but an attempt to standardise and make it work. In English, there's a ton of variation (classic English). So you'll hear it pronounced win, nwin, when, new-jin, gwen, ngwin, new-yen etc. None of them are wrong. Nobody's lying to you (well they might be having a laugh but generally nobody's lying to you ((about the name at least))). So in a way, they're all so wrong that they're right. It's an unfortunate case of you're probably just going to have to remember what someone prefers. The upside? Most have had people screw it up so often that they don't usually care too much. 

**tl;dr: everyone is wrong and everyone is right. It's a hard name to pronounce if you don't speak the language, so people use different ""next-closest"" options**",44,0,1443669043,1444723167

I suppose what is controversial is the conclusion of thinking they not be conducting air strikes. The alternate view I suppose is that we need to be helping those trying to fight back internally. ",1,0,1443667289,1444723167
