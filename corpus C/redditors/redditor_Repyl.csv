cvjznr0,0,t1_cvjzkps,Repyl,"How do you know that this painting hasn't been restored? It's not unusual to restore paintings. This painting shows a sunset, which naturally casts a very varm and dim light over the landscape. The blue and cold version simply doesn't make sense. ",5,0,1443660966,1444723092
cvjzejo,0,t1_cvjyw7s,Repyl,"The version that I am referring to is the one from the British National Gallery. You can find it [here](http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/claude-joseph-vernet-a-landscape-at-sunset). It is absolutely true, that you can find a different version on the internet, of this painting, where the color temperature is slightly colder and the brightness is slightly higher - like [this](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3089/5871832527_19a0a33cf1.jpg). When compared to his other works, like ""A Calm at a Mediterranean port"" from 1770, you can see that the colors scheme is very similar to the ""dull"" version. I'm not claiming that any of these are true, since they are all scans or photos of the origininal piece, what I am claiming though, is that they are all very far from the primary color assault that OP is presenting.",4,0,1443660537,1444723092
