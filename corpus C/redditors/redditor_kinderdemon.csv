cvxvdme,0,t1_cvxuy41,kinderdemon,"Or it was just a ghost.  People are so weird about ghosts, like as if a ghost is simultaneously proof of an afterlife, God, the Devil and the Flying Spaghetti monster, when really it is just proof of ghosts.

Ghosts don't have to be animate spirits, or wandering souls. Hell they could be the psychic equivalent of finger prints, rather than anything like a thinking being. A psychic voice mail that cannot be erased, rather than a lingering, suffering spirit. Maybe they are purely internal phenomena, that happen to people, but don't exist outside them, like localized hallucinations left behind by someone and picked up by incoming people somehow. 

I mean we don't find things like sacred rocks or trees strange: all it takes is a few centuries of people praying at something, and it gains an excess of meaning, so that other people coming to the special rock will immediately feel ""yes, this place is sacred"".  We don't call it delusional, it is just priming and faith, both part of human meaning making, making life worth living etc. 

Maybe ghosts are similar, just caused by really intense experiences: tragedies etc, so people get aftershocks of the event without years of priming: maybe really intense tragedies imprint a location once and for good with a ""ghost"".

 Who knows? No serious scientist will ever touch it, because they would be branded a kook, so if there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for ghosts (besides Monoxide leaks) we would never even begin to investigate it. On ghosts, perfectly rational people turn into 19th century positivists who insist that all real things must be readily visible and already inside a lab (not like we dropped two atomic bombs before we discovered the whole radiation thing was an lingering issue, right?) To rationalize away ghosts, people contrive crazy scenarios where people driving cars with friends suddenly experience the same hallucination (probably due to swamp gas), and other impossibly convoluted chains of events leading to several sane people turning into delusional people and around the same delusion and then back again to sanity. 

It doesn't seem completely rational to dismiss all the many ghost stories from around the world, over the centuries on the basis that it doesn't agree with either a dogmatic atheistic position, or some Judeo-Christian afterlife model: it isn't an either/or. Just because there is no God, doesn't mean everyone who claims they saw a ghost is lying or delusional, and vice versa, just because there is a God, doesn't mean that ghosts are demons in disguise or souls denied paradise or whatever.

I would be incredibly skeptical if someone claimed to speak to a ghost, or that ghosts give some access to some beyond.

That said, the place of ghosts as a consistent part of the human experience seems to indicate that people do have encounters that can only rationally be described as with ""ghosts"", in the sense that they both meet existing cultural expectations of the ghost story and add new and interesting elements of versimilitude and genuine experience.

If you are willing to throw away a human life for personal gain, it doesn't matter if you are doing it for a candy bar or for a billion dollars. Individual lives are irreplaceable. All you've revealed is that you stop being a decent human being at X sum of money.

It is a bit like saying you'd never poison your best friend who absolutely trusts you for anything less than X.  If X is a monetary amount you are a terrible person, regardless of if X is 5$ or 5,000,000,000,000$",1,0,1444690615,1444716378

The best forum I know of for deep talk and game gossip is the bay12forums ""other games"" board. As the Dwarf Fortress home forum, everyone on it is already an Indy game elitist, in other games they discuss everything but Dwarf Fortress, so it is full of recommendations. Adams and his brother moderate away the riff raff and gamergator trash. The result is a board which is far more likely to be talking about Solium Infernum then Call of Duty or whatever.

The Sanders circle jerk feels gross. It went completely racist over blacklivesmatter, stays consistently sexist about Hillary and just feels thoroughly hypocritical on most days. 

This doesn't reflect Sanders at all, he remains awesome, it just reflects the immaturity of his strongest supporters and cements the unlikelihood that he will gain national support. 

**TL:DR** Most Hillary supporters like Sanders, but think he is a long shot. Sanders supporters act like Hillary is the devil.  This is annoying.",19,0,1444663510,1444716378

I highly second what HedrOn said: Vassal is great for learning the game. You can usually find someone to play with through the forums, and Vassal has numerous conveniences unavailable in the real world: 

e.g. you can set models to display auras of any range, so you never forget someone is in Pandora's misery aura etc.  You can set every model to dispay their engagement as an aura. 

After a few games with vassal, it is a lot easier to remember (and remember to apply) all the ranges, auras, pulses and stuff on the table top, mostly because you already have a visual referent rather than just an abstract distance, rules and a tape measure. ",1,0,1444662944,1444716378
