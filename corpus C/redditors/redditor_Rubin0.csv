cv6eq44,1,t3_3lflkp,Rubin0,"There is a massive difference between a SuperPac and an editorial board submitting content. In my opinion, the most important distinction is the willingness of the audience. If an editorial board is going to give their political opinion, who is going to see it? Only those who are specifically reading the political editorial section of that newspaper. SuperPacs buy ad time on television and solicit via mail, email, boots on the ground, etcetera. The people who will see these endorsements are usually not actively searching for them.

The second difference is reach and accountability. SuperPacs allow for interests to inject their opinions into elections far away. Recently, the majority of state elections had their funding come from outside their respective states. I have a serious problem with that. This is compounded when the donors to superpacs are kept secret. It is 100% possible that foreign interests have been spending money to influence U.S. Elections.

The final issue is scale. The truth is that money is effective in politics. SuperPacs transformed the field into a nuclear arms race. Though there have been some exceptions, massive amounts of money will lead to an advantage and can only be countered with another pile. In order to build the war chests necessary to maintain such a campaign, politicians are forced to fundraise like never before. Senators spend roughly 3/4 of their time fundraising (npr had the fact but I can't look it up on my phone right now). Is it naive for me to believe that this is a corrupting influence?

Going to the specific court case, I think that the Hillary Clinton film was perfectly legal but the decision was left far too open and allowed for the creation of tools that went far behind even the intention of the court.

The law has very specific guidelines where donations and speech can be limited if they corrupt **or create the appearance** of corruption. Scalia's interpretation of they passage is that money is only corrupting if there is a concrete ""quid pro quo"" bribe. I find that assertion to be absurd.

For the above reasons, I am extremely against SuperPacs. ",2,0,1442617712,1444727234

ctsc2mz,1,t3_3ftuad,Rubin0,"I believe you have misunderstood the hate surrounding Comic Sans. The biggest offense with Comic Sans is not that it is especially terrible but that it is used everywhere. For some reason, Comic Sans is an incredibly popular font. While I may have experienced the odd Papyrus usage, I have seen at least 20 restaurant menus that used Comic Sans. It is grating.

Comic Sans has come to represent a failure of design which is what makes it so hated.",1,0,1438785605,1444727234
