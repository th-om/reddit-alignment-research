What does Hitler have to do with anything?

Sickle-cell anemia is a hereditary disease. It is entirely genetic. You're welcome to dismiss it as ""superficial"" if you'd like, but that isn't an argument. This sounds like a creationist arguing the differences between micro and macro evolution

>No you are not more genetically similar to someone of the same race, that was my point. About 95% of variation present in the human population in general regardless of race. So you might be guaranteed to differ in 5% but for the 95% of human variation you're as likely to be as closely related to someone of a different race than someone as the same. What that means is that it has a very low-predictive ability, if you ran a t-test only 1 in 20 times would it say that your results appear likely to indicate two different populations (populations defined as not conforming to a single standard distribution, a very low bar to pass).

>In what follows, we use several collections of loci genotyped in various human populations to examine the relationship between claims a, b, and c above. These data sets vary in the numbers of polymorphic loci genotyped, population sampling strategies, polymorphism ascertainment methods, and average allele frequencies. To assess claim c, **we define ω as the frequency with which a pair of individuals from different populations is genetically more similar than a pair from the same population**. We show that claim c, the observation of high ω, holds with small collections of loci. It holds even with hundreds of loci, especially if the populations sampled have not been isolated from each other for long. It breaks down, however, **with data sets comprising thousands of loci genotyped in geographically distinct populations: In such cases, ω becomes zero**. Classification methods similarly yield high error rates with few loci and almost no errors with thousands of loci. Unlike ω, however, **classification statistics make use of aggregate properties of populations, so they can approach 100% accuracy with as few as 100 loci.**

""95% of genetic variation is within population groups, therefore race is not a useful concept"" is a complete non sequitur.

>Brain size and psychopathy: at birth the differences are almost nothing in brain size, which indicates that it is likely the result of post-natal influences, i.e. nutrition. This makes sense considering that on average people of historically oppressed races (black people especially) belong to a lower socioeconomic grouping. Psychopathy is very easy to mistake with low-level sociopathy which is primarily environmental, and again can be traced back to socioeconomic status.

Conjecture.

>We have the same amount of variation as chimpanzees yes, but in chimpanzees the variation has a strong link with particular populations while in humans the variation exists across populations and ""races"" which means it is impossible to categorize individuals into a given subspecies based on that alone.

No:

[We studied human population structure using genotypes at 377 autosomal microsatellite loci in 1056 individuals from 52 populations. Within-population differences among individuals account for 93 to 95% of genetic variation; differences among major groups constitute only 3 to 5%. Nevertheless, without using prior information about the origins of individuals, we identified six main genetic clusters, five of which correspond to major geographic regions, and subclusters that often correspond to individual populations. General agreement of genetic and predefined populations suggests that self-reported ancestry can facilitate assessments of epidemiological risks but does not obviate the need to use genetic information in genetic association studies. ](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/298/5602/2381)

Further elaboration on that study:

[Previously, we observed that without using prior information about individual sampling locations, a clustering algorithm applied to multilocus genotypes from worldwide human populations produced genetic clusters largely coincident with major geographic regions. It has been argued, however, that the degree of clustering is diminished by use of samples with greater uniformity in geographic distribution, and that the clusters we identified were a consequence of uneven sampling along genetic clines. Expanding our earlier dataset from 377 to 993 markers, we systematically examine the influence of several study design variables—sample size, number of loci, number of clusters, assumptions about correlations in allele frequencies across populations, and the geographic dispersion of the sample—on the “clusteredness” of individuals. With all other variables held constant, geographic dispersion is seen to have comparatively little effect on the degree of clustering. Examination of the relationship between genetic and geographic distance supports a view in which the clusters arise not as an artifact of the sampling scheme, but from small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance for most population pairs on opposite sides of geographic barriers, in comparison with genetic distance for pairs on the same side. Thus, analysis of the 993-locus dataset corroborates our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently large worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions.](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010070)
