https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_symbolism

The original symbol of fascism, in Italy under Benito Mussolini, was the fasces. This is an ancient Imperial Roman symbol of power carried by lictors in front of magistrates; a bundle of sticks featuring an axe, indicating the power over life and death. ",44,0,1444531366,1444716725

cvpqidy,0,t1_cvpmtcs,buzzit292,"Oh man, I meant your perspective on whether I was strawmanning, but there are many perspectives on what a nation state, or purpose of one is. 

Even one that I suspect coincides with your perspective does not mention advancement of citizens. 

http://www.towson.edu/polsci/ppp/sp97/realism/whatisns.htm

Or see Weber, Marx, Perry Anderson etc.

Not that I generally disagree that people come together to achieve their interests, but if formal and actual power is not distributed, then the purpose of the state in practice will be much different than the purpose of one where power is distributed. I think one would be interested in advancement of citizens generally rather than certain groups of citizens or certain actors in particular. 

Thus we're back to the point I was trying to make earlier. The fact that our representatives, who in reality tend to represent elites in their actions, have promoted a particular Iraq/Syria policy should not be taken as evidence that that policy advances the interests of citizens, broadly speaking. The policy is an expression of the power dynamics in the U.S. and very likely does not correspond to the longterm, broadbased interest. 

I understand your point that states are not obligated to achieve peace or be unhypocritical.  I accept that to a point, though we have embraced many treaties and have understood that to be in our interest to some extent.

cvpiikv,0,t1_cvpbftg,buzzit292,"Not a strawman really, it's more of a response to the unhelpfulness of your abstract view. If the purpose of a nation is to advance it citizens' (interests), then it certainly matters whether those interests are represented in making policy rather than the interests of a subset of the population.

The reasoning used by realists in discourse is kind of circular:  ""Countries pursue their interests, so whatever policy has been implemented is in the country's interest ... and stop there. ""

We need to reflect on whether the decisions are good ones and are in fact in our interest rather than the interests of a subset of the population.   ",1,0,1444089229,1444716725
cvp9r2r,0,t1_cvp96u7,buzzit292,"This simplistic view is the crux of the problem and why there is disagreement with your point. 

There are power dynamics in the U.S. that make it so the ""elected"" representatives work in the interest of select elite groups. This is well established by serious political-science analysis. 

The policies being pushed are not the ones the people would likely push if the government was actually responsive to the population. The easy ""out"" is to say the people get the govt they deserve, and while there is some truth to that in the U.S. case, the power dynamics are very entrenched and by the time elections happen, the choices have already been constrained so much that differences are moot.

If your going to argue that interests are being served, I think you need to bring in some sort of class analysis or elites theory into it.

cvk1mks,0,t1_cvk0ps8,buzzit292,"You need to consider  ""actually existing capitalism"" not the ideal form. 

Actually existing capitalism has been spread through a mix of  violence, voluntary action and soft power. See the East India Company in India for example.  Colonialism and later imperialism were also such manifestations.

National liberation organizations revolted against many forms of actually existing capitalism. These were left movements, sometimes not initially socialist. They sometimes moved towards socialism because basic democracy or social democracy were rejected by the the local ruling class or imperialist powers.   See for example Allende's Chile. [Edit acutally, Allende's Chile probably not a good example because Allende was pretty firmsly socialist when elected. The Sandinistas might be a better example.]",8,0,1443664347,1444716725
cvjhuoi,0,t1_cviz91l,buzzit292,"Did he say ""We will do this thing if you do this?"" ... no he used a vague term like redline in a vauge context. People make too much out of this. It's much more of a concern that the US would take action with ambigous intelligence or a unclear endgame. 

This is what Obama said: 

Obama: ""... I have, at this point, not ordered military engagement in the situation. But the point that you made about chemical and biological weapons is critical. That’s an issue that doesn’t just concern Syria; it concerns our close allies in the region, including Israel. It concerns us. We cannot have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people.

We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation. ...""

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/sep/05/context-president-obama-syria-red-line/

Assuming the evidence was there for the sake of the argument, the equation did change, and he was able to extract a major concession that removed the threat. 

Even though people interpret it that way it wasn't a 100% guarantee that the U.S. would take military action.  Even if Obama said he would, I would rather have a president, congress and electorate that would change their mind based on the context and alternatives.  ",1,0,1443633952,1444716725
