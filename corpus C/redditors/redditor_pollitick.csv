In *your* opinion. These people are under a spell that needs to be broken. They think they are sincere but they are the worst kind of ignorant. They are working on ejaculating, thinking with the wrong head. Just because some pretty dark haired boy whispered sweet nothings in their ear. Oh, and because the *US* supports the only democracy in the region - and other bad reasons(religion).  The old ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"".

Umm, because they were under the thumb of the european imperialists?


>Or how the Israelis stormed into territory designated for Palestineans by the UN immediately after declaring independence? 


A powerless organization when it came to the european imperialists and their ""treaties"". Some peoples honor treaties. 

I'll bet you are too stupid to know that *everyone* living there under the imperialists were *palestinians*. Then they became citizens of Israel, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Except the pawns, who the Jordanians stashed in refugee camps, until they could build rhetoric to fool idiots like you with their pawns. 

What are your sources? First hand, second, third? What is their agenda? Kingdoms? Look whose *schmuck* you are sucking.

You trust imperialists. You are no socialist. Get the fuck out.",-3,0,1444161177,1444722151

cvqfcr3,0,t1_cvqeuhh,pollitick,"Wages based on supply and demand have absolutely *no relation* to worth of the workers labor. None. They are totally unrelated. 

What are wages based on? If there are more laborers competing than there are jobs the wages will be minimized. 

What is income from the result(the product or service) based on? Prices are based on the supply and demand *of the product.* The capitalist can limit the supply of the product to jack up prices for the consumer, and they can create demand(through manipulative advertising) to jack up the prices as well.
