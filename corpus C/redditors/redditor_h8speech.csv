Having said that, I think that /u/777yourface is trying to say that Erdogan is not a true believer in Islamism but that he is rather more interested in using it as a vehicle to attain his personal goals.

Learn to think clearly and logically, force yourself into the discipline of applying structured thought (and, if necessary, research) prior to expressing what would have been a worthless opinion - and you'll have done yourself a great favour. 

ETA: An example of *research* would have been taking 5-9 seconds to confirm that I was not the same user who used the phrase ""disney villain understanding"". So, you know, we're not talking about a highly academic process here.

My understanding was that you were being sarcastic, while your actual meaning was ""ew, russia and assad are not empathic and don't want to give up power, such brutes."" Are you saying that was not your actual meaning? ",2,0,1443541338,1444731606

The biggest idealistic do-gooders since colonialism are the Americans, and it usually turns into a blood-soaked catastrophe, just like it did during colonialism, and even then you don't see them bringing back anyone's girls. Even in America the choice of who to ally with is entirely about who's useful and not in any way about who's good. We ally ourselves with the fucking Saudis, have you forgotten?

Also, your second sentence is actually funny. I'm actually laughing here. Buddy, we deal in what you call ""hypothetical""s every day. For example, when I drive to work, I avoid driving into the wall because *hypothetically* if I drove into the wall at high speed I *assume* I might die or be crippled. Sure I'm assuming Russia would retaliate. Just like I assume I might be executed if I ran around central Raqqah screaming obscenities about Mohammed.

cvh05cu,0,t1_cvgymoy,h8speech,"I'm not sure you understand the purpose of using the parallel, so let me unpack that for you. 

It seems to me that your issue here is due to a dislike of one particular country for reasons not pertinent to the discussion. You are claiming that no, you have some reasons, you're not just angry with Israel. Okay, good. Please show me them.

I'm asking you: Can you create a set of principles, any set of principles, under which it is a) justified for a country in the position of Russia in Crimea to retaliate if under rocket fire from a country in the position of Ukraine; b) unjustified for a country in the position of Israel in the Golan to retaliate if under rocket fire from a country in the position of Syria. Since you are demonstrating that you're not motivated by dislike of any particular nation, and instead have a set of generally applicable moral views in mind, you should be able to make up such a set of principles without including the names of any of the countries.

It'd look like this:

A) It's the right of a nationstate to defend itself but

B) It's not the right of a nationstate to engage in aggressive war

C) Aggressive war is defined as blah blah blah

Good luck!

 PS: 

I'm not especially pro-Israel... but wow, ain't it /r/drivethejewintothesea in here lately? I'm only interested in whether you can form a rational argument on this topic or not, I don't care much beyond that. For what it's worth, I can think of one reasonably sound distinction you could draw here to make your point and meet my challenge... but I don't think you've thought of it, I think you're just one of these people who gets angry when the I-word gets mentioned, and I think unreasoned hate should be called out no matter who it's against. If you would rather just admit that you don't have a principle in mind other than ""israel's bad"", I'll tell you how you could justify Russian retaliation but not Israeli. It's not the strongest argument but it's better than anything you've put forward so far, so I can't say fairer than that.",2,0,1443457231,1444731606
