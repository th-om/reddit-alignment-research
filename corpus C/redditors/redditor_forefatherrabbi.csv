So it is limited if you compare it to android and iOS, but leaps and bounds ahead of BB, Mozilla's OS, and others.It is the tiniest of the major app stores.",2,0,1444430948,1444726514

Verizon simply said no.  You had to get some other phone's sim activates then put it in the google phone.  ,1,0,1444263201,1444726514
cvr8za2,0,t1_cvqo4wc,forefatherrabbi,"I think they canned it because when Microsoft releases tech that is ahead of the curve, in the past, it tended to fail or wither on the vine.  To many of Microsoft's past ideas where ahead of their time, but when they failed they never looked at why and tried to fix it, just move on to the next idea.  That's why it took apple to make smart phones and tablets a main stream thing.I think the new Microsoft has learned from the mistake, but the phone division is really under the gun and a force touch would require a lot of work from the OS team as well as developers.  And since developers are not flocking to windows I think they didn't want to add yet another thing that makes the platform too different and great more work.  That is my thought to why Microsoft has moved hard to the hamburger button, to make it simpler for developers to just get their app into the store without having to redesign and think about a new UX.(Just my opinions)",1,0,1444225816,1444726514
cvr8q2a,0,t1_cvq6tgb,forefatherrabbi,"I think apple could have made something like this, but they have not positioned their OS offering to allow for something as powerful as this.  My understanding is there really is no touch screen computers that run OSX, only iOS.  Had they taken the unification route, like Microsoft did, they could have easily done something similar (based on how well they pushed ahead the mac book air area and crammed stuff in there).  I think that their software is what is holding back their hardware offerings.(I am a Microsoft guy, so take my views with that bias in mind)",1,0,1444225336,1444726514
