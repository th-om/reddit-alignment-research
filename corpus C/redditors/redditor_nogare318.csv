I said the vocals are laid back and free flowing, as in they aren't necessarily the tightly structured singing verses in the popular music of the time, and they often had a conversational tone, albeit one that could quickly rise up in emotion. I would never doubt the complexity of the music, because I know it is extremely challenging to  craft an effective blues/rap verse.",6,0,1444351205,1444719070

I find it annoying, immature, antagonistic, and totally meaningless. It reeks of internet lolsorandumb humor, and will turn off the older and more conservative voters. 

""Millenials"" alone can't win the election, so pandering to them is a dumbass move for Sanders supporters. If they had half a brain they would come up with new phrases that cater to, I don't know, the minorities of America that don't even know his name, for starters.

I support him and want him to win, but his deluded and obnoxious supporters will lose the election for him. ",0,0,1444022339,1444719070

If everyone fucked off and took a vow of silence because of some revelation they had, well, we wouldn't make it too far. There's actually no reason to close this subreddit. It's a ridiculous and selfish move. ""Oh, it's not what i like anymore"" too fucking bad. It's not yours anymore, it belongs to everyone who has ever enjoyed it, anyone who ever posted, anyone who ever built it to the point it's at. 

I don't mean to sound like a prick, but I like this subreddit. It's shown me things that I have loved, and to think it will be erased for nothing is unsettling. If you want, you can turn it over to someone else. Hell, I would be willing to run this place if you let me.

Please, reconsider.",68,0,1442961990,1444719070
