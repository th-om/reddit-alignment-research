But that's what you're doing when you assume human life is inherently valuable.   Unless you're as outraged about, say, animal agriculture as you are about abortion. Do all living things have inherent value, or just things that look like you?

> This bizarre argument of yours implies that people are better off dead than destitute

Maybe. It implies that while I was never inconvenienced by the billions of years I spent in the void of the nonliving, I have been inconvenienced-- and often pained-- by the struggles of everyday life.   How is it more virtuous to impose that on me? How would abortion have made me a victim? ",1,0,1444680392,1444724374
cvx1pzg,0,t1_cvx0iol,I-HATE-REDDITORS,"Why do you assume human life has inherent value?  Most human lives are miserable.  Most living things live awful lives and die horrible, painful deaths. 

Objectively, the natural world, the planet, and certainly the universe put no value on human lives or humanity as a whole.  In fact, humans have acted to the detriment of every other expression of life on the planet.  The only reason to think human life is uniquely valuable is out of self-serving convenience: you and I happen to be living humans.

You and I and most people would rather not be murdered or euthanized.  That's the only reason we abhor killing. But as fun as it is to be alive (in my case), I don't remember caring one way or another before I was born.  Life and death are arbitrary in the developing mind of an unborn baby.  If one dies, who is the victim?  After all, how is it less humane than bringing someone into an inescapable world without consent, where he's doomed to work and fight for survival for 70+ years? The circumstances of the lower class in Mumbai certainly seem more cruel than abortion.",4,0,1444667376,1444724374
