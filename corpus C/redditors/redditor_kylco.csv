cvwv9a6,0,t1_cvwt9v4,kylco,"So, I've been sitting out this shitshow becuase I'm gay and in our community 60 is the number for a respectably experienced gay who went through a proper slut phase and knows what he wants. There are guys who care about this, obviously, but it's very much an artifact of a prudish and sex-negative culture. This woman knows she likes sex, has been safe about it, and (to have that much experience by 23) doesn't play games or dance around what she likes. She has adult attitudes towards sex - adult in the sense that she has depth of experience, understanding of consequence,and context on variety. 

This is precisely the kind of woman that many men want, should want, and say they want. A blushing virgin is fine. A woman who won't lie about *exactly* where your dick needs to go to send her yo-yoing between your bed and Jupiter is damned fine too.

A lot of people here said or suggested that anyone with 60 sexual partners is in some way damaged or insecure. I have friends whose bedposts have been whittled down to matchsticks. They're hot, fun, interesting people, so no wonder! If our chemistry were right, I'd happily contribute to the notches, and if a romantic relationship came of it, I'd be totally secure in the knowledge that *I* was the one they picked with far better context than I have. I'm not super-obsessed with monogamy anyway (holla, /r/polyamory!) so if they wanted to keep marking 'em up, good for them!

I know that this isn't the popular view. But we gay folk tend to know that what's popular and what's right tend to have a complicated and distant relationship. Relationships are between people. And if you can't see a person for the number floating above her head, it says a lot more about your inferences and attitudes than it does about her and hers.",-1,0,1444655554,1444719317
cvwrk7r,0,t1_cvwdvpt,kylco,"According to my straight friends, finding a single, smart, attractive *and* nerdy woman is like finding a live unicorn in the wild.

One of said friends is also a remarkably effective unicorn hunter who picked up a woman of the metro just on the basis of her reading a discworld novel and getting off at my stop. He was there hours late to our gaming get-together, but I must stress that these are not typical results by any stretch of the term.",2,0,1444642090,1444719317

cvuwech,1,t3_3o3uph,kylco,"I actually turned a straight friend into a Gay Avenger for a moment. We'd gone to a gay bar to put a lacquer on the night after dinner with friends earlier in the evening, and after a few drinks wandered around the dance floor. I noticed a douchebag creeping on some girls - obviously straight - and pointed him out.

My friend moved in on him like a heat-seeking missile. Straight douchebag was scared off (friend is an obviously fit young marine with the standard-issue haircut) girl was surprised but seemed happy about the situation, and my friend was so drunk I he forgot the entire episode until I recounted it to him the next day.",3,0,1444495821,1444719317

cvtmxgb,0,t1_cvtmpbu,kylco,"This is something we have now, called the Earned Income Tax Credit in the US. It is criticized by some economists for creating disincentives to labor near the tail of the income distribution. (Though in-kind benefits dropping off before or around that point tend to be larger disincentives.) It is a weaker form of the Minimum Income Guarantee, hough the form you propose with phaseouts does not change the labor disincentive. UBI eliminates labor disincentive by granting the same, subsistence amount to everyone, whether they are high earners or not. Tax schemes above the UBI vary widely, but if you wanted to eliminate all labor disincentive a flat tax of all Earned Income would go a long way. Not my preferred tax policy, but an internally-consistent one.",7,0,1444396117,1444719317
