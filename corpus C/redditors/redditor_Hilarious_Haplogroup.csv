cvx82oa,1,t3_3o1vmt,Hilarious_Haplogroup,"IMHO, Life is the meaning of life.  Life is the purpose of life.  We live in order to live.  When one states ""What is the meaning of life?"" then you are presupposing the existence of an entity that exists exterior to life, i.e. God.  

If God is the result of the universe, or the sum total of the universe, then this sort of God is emotionally unsatisfying.  It doesn't make much sense to pray to the laws of gravity.  

Billions of humans wish for a God to exist to fulfill their emotional needs.  In our scientific age, the Big Bang and the Theory of Evolution preclude a literal reading of the holy books from being plausible or realistic.  Nowadays, Quantum physics gets bent into pretzels to make this longed for God to be justifiable as an entity.  

As was stated in http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Quantum_woo (an excellent article on their site) 

Quote...

Quantum woo is the justification of irrational beliefs by an obfuscatory reference to quantum physics. Buzzwords like ""energy field"", ""probability wave"", or ""wave-particle duality"" are used to magically turn thoughts into something tangible in order to directly affect the universe. This results in such foolishness as the Law of Attraction or quantum healing. Some have turned quantum woo into a career, such as Deepak Chopra, who often presents ill-defined concepts of quantum physics as proof for God and other magical thinking.

/u/WillThug, I hope the tone of my post comes to you as a sincere voice inside your mind instead of a sarcastic voice, because that is how I am trying to convey my message.  My question, and I will read your response carefully if you choose to reply, is the following: Do you long for there to be a God, and if so, are you trying to use Physics to substantiate the odds of God existing?

Thank you for your time.",2,0,1444676704,1444725605

These failed states will always be able to blame the West for their problems, too.  I simply can't detect any hope that any methodology from any group, East or West, will ever be able to break this cycle.  They seemed hopelessly doomed to this fate.",2,0,1444529153,1444725605

As the liner notes of this Youtube clip said, ""The epic album is notable for its many musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts - all of which were features of the progressive rock scene, of which was emerging at the time. In addition, the instrumentation includes harpsichord, xylophone, timpani, violin, lute, trumphet, saxophone, and a string section-all uncommon in blues-based rock.""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvBpW0ksE-k",27,0,1444315673,1444725605
