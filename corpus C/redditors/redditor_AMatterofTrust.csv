cvxn7ak,1,t3_3oiw2c,AMatterofTrust,"""She worked to oust Qadhafi ...""

It requires a lot of ignoring history to state that that was in any way good. I am fine with ousting the person if political stability can be added in its place. That has not happened. Libya is an absolute disaster comparable to Iraq. Sure, we ousted Saddam Hussein, who was a genocidal manic, but ...

""Secretary Clinton was critical in America's ""pivot to Asia"" strategy""

Sure she was. By laying the foundation to the TPP. Oh wait, guess who droped support for the TPP?

""Clinton helped restore American leadership ...""

HOW? Look at the middle east today. Russia is completely ignoring our significance as a ""world power."" How did she restore American leadership?

""Engaged in economic stagecraft""

By putting in place things that led to the creation to the TPP (oh wait ...). Besides that, what exactly has she done?

""Brought the state department into the 20th century.""

That is completely meaningless. Sure it is good, but I would hardly count that as an ""accomplishment.""

cvw67tp,1,t3_3od6u9,AMatterofTrust,"Okay let me provide an example. 

There exists a freedom caucus member in NJ by the name of Scott Garret. He is one of the most conservative members in the house. Now lets be honest, does having tea party views, in Bergen County, in **New Jersey** of all places, necessarily help him? Of course not. They hurt him a lot. So why does he have them? Because that is what he believes. And though he is in his fourth term, these beliefs hurt him, though he has shown capacity for winning elections under these views. 

The same people who kicked out Eric Cantor from office also run for things.  That is not unbelievable nor is it uncommon. 

I would say Ted Cruz is extreme. Why would he run under hat platform then? The person most likely to win the nomination is a moderate! Jeb Bush, according to prediction data, and even Marco Rubio has establishment characteristics. And while the party is fractured, and has been for some time, the winner of the nomination is **always** a moderate. So why is he running under his position? 

Now, in elections, people say things that they don't believe in to win votes. Cruz is doing that, of course he is. As is everyone. Do you really think Hilary Clinton opposes the TPP? She helped make the thing!And she cannot claim ignorance because again, she should have known the basics of what was inside, she helped make it. And the only reason Bernie Sanders does not do it is because he does not try to pass policy, rather introduce a not well written bill he knows he can't pass, refuses to compromise, and uses that to win votes. Watch any of Ted Cruz's speech's before the presidential race. They are less bombastic, less outlandish, but as a result less powerful. 

But his views on policy have not changed much comparing the two. The tone of voice changes, because you are not creating policy but trying to relate to voters, none of whom understand policy, 

I suggest you watch some of Ted Cruz's speeches before he decided to run. Or his questioning at hearings. He will come across as more intelligent. But he will be less powerful. But largely, his views, and the same holds true for everyone, their views will not change, only the way they express them. ",3,0,1444595674,1444717664
cvw5b8j,0,t1_cvw46ko,AMatterofTrust,"""0% unemployment""

I strongly doubt that is true and even if it is, 0% unemployment is in fact terrible for an economy (when people quit jobs and move to new ones, they become ""unemployed,"" and thus a small amount of unemployment is necessary for any social mobility). I believe you mean to say unemployment = full employment, but I don't think that was true in Nazi Germany. 

And one of the main reason for Germany's success was their open infringement of many of the economic sanctions put on them. Which while a good move (the sanctions were meaningless and pointless) it had nothing to do with the benefits of fascism itself (other than to say in facism, people violate treaties.)",1,0,1444594347,1444717664

cvvgbzy,0,t1_cvvfoj2,AMatterofTrust,"Well, gerrymandering is a thing because **any** districting, done by anyone, will have some degree of bias, even in a two-party system, even if done by a independent forum. And it largely concerns how the people themselves are going to be represented. 

For example, I live in NJ, heavily gerrymandered in favor of democrats. I as a republican do not feel as though there is this massive conspiracy to suppress my viewpoint, even though for all intents and purposes there is, because in the end I vote for whatever district I am in, and the districts are set by the state, and largely concern how I am represented. 

Compare that with a national thing to suppress my viewpoint, who have no consideration for how I am represented, but will manufacture districts in a way such that I am not heard. Or not I, because I am not a tea party member, but someone. They are different things. Yes, districts are gerrymandered in both cases, but in one, my viewpoint still matters, even if watered down, in another, it does not. ",6,0,1444532994,1444717664
