Coven was just very inconsistent with the rules of death and the afterlife.

* Nan = Soul given to Legba
* Misty = Hell, body disappears
* Zoe = Hell, body doesn't disappear
* Fiona = No soul, soul goes to Hell anyway, body doesn't disappear
* Spalding = Soul is ghost in the house
* Axeman = Soul is ghost in the house, later shared Hell
* Madison = Nothing
* Marie & Delphine = Shared Hell
* Pembrooke & Warlock = Died in house, no ghost to speak of
