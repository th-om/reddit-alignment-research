He's been a decent representative so far, does a pretty good job at reaching out and engaging his constituency via a combination of social media and town halls.

It's a lot easier to reinforce a ""D= good, R = bad (or vice versa)"" mentality than it is to debate individual candidates and issues.

Although, the answer to this question may change depending on your definition of ""uninformed"".
