cvwwsro,0,t1_cvwv7v6,StarTrekMike,"This is actually very true and it's interesting that I don't see this brought up more. Counter-strike was never really designed to be the ultra-competitive e-sport style shooter that it has become. When it was still just a mod, it was a incredibly popular shooter where a great majority of the players just kinda ran around and had fun (while bitching about the AWP). It was a casual shooter and nobody really cared, it was fun.

  It's just like Starcraft. The ultra-competitive RTS scene did not even exist when Starcraft first came out. before it blew up as a e-sport, players just kinda played it casually in the same way they played Warcraft or Command and Conquer.",2,0,1444658970,1444729653
cvwwjwa,0,t1_cvwjwh9,StarTrekMike,"The difference between Arma and CS is almost like the difference between Quake and the original Rainbow six. Quake (like CS) was built on a foundation of accessibility and fun. It was not built with the e-sports style competitive scene in mind since it predated that style of play by a pretty large margin. 

  On  the other hand, the original Rainbow six was built entirely around the idea of realism and authenticity. This meant that there was no real consideration for balance or even room for meta-games and dominant strategies. The goal of the players is not to play effectively in a competitive context but to play effectively with real world tactics and weapon capabilities in mind.

  This kinda gets down to intent of the developer more than anything else. Arma is built to be a milsim or perhaps (more accurately) a infantry simulator. It's gameplay depth is front loaded and as such, the player has to do some (relatively) significant amount of learning in order to even really play _at all_. Let alone play effectively with a mil-sim group. 

  Counter-strike is kinda the reverse. The base game has not really changed much since it was just a mod for Half-life. It's still a pretty simple formula with no real emphasis on front loaded difficulty on it's own. At it's core, it's still just a old-school shooter and anyone who has even a passing familiarity with old school shooters can generally figure out how to play in the most basic form in less than a few minutes. This is not a bad thing at all, it's just a testament to CS's roots, it reflects the style of shooter that was popular when CS was first created.

  Counter-strike's real difficulty curve is one that is player/community built. If you were to grab ten shooter players off the street who have never played Counter-strike and have them play it, you would find that they would pick up on the basic idea very quickly. It would get significantly more complicated if you switched out those new players with CS pro's who have been playing since 2002.

   You see, the pro players are playing the game on a level that is _far_ beyond what was originally intended. It's the same with Starcraft. It is easy to forget that Starcraft was originally just another RTS. It was never _built_ to be a ultra-competitive platform with players learning every single tiny detail and breaking it all down into pure math. It just got that way because the players have had so much time to build that structure on top of the basic game.

  To put it simply, Arma has it's heavy learning curve built right into the basic fabric of the game. A player can't really play it as it was intended without spending some (relatively) significant time on learning it's systems. Counter-strike is a simple game to just hop in and play but the moment you decide to play on a competitive (or even casually competitive) level, you need to learn the player constructed meta-game. You need to take the time to learn all the established dominant strategies that players have crafted and perfected. It's a simple game to learn but it's hard to play competitively.

  When you strip away all the meta-game layers and competitive scene, Counter-strike is a _very_ simple shooter that is very easy to just jump in and play.

cvw6ad8,0,t1_cvw5ojc,StarTrekMike,"""Franchise fatigue"" stopped being a problem when Berman and Braga left Trek. The franchise was only fatigued because Berman and Braga stuck around longer than they really should have.

  Heck, I would even say that Enterprise failed to get traction because some fans simply were burned out after Voyager's (longer than it really deserved) run. I know Voyager has it's dedicated fans but as a whole, it was the first major sign that Berman needed to move on and make room for new talent. Pretty much everything he produced (both film and series) during the Voyager/Enterprise days was not great and DS9 only managed to escape that fate since it seemed that he kept his distance for it.",5,0,1444595782,1444729653
cvw2va1,0,t1_cvvvfdw,StarTrekMike,"I get what you are saying but as a Doctor Who fan myself, the reason that show works is because it is often pretty goofy. There are a lot of elements about that show that just would not work if it were to take on a overall more serious tone. Even when you get a serious episode, the underlying tone is still a bit wacky intentionally.

  Doctor Who is popular because it's formula allows for a quirky time traveler and his companions to all pile into a little blue police box and go on crazy adventures. The show has it's tongue firmly planted in it's cheek, as such, it's easy to overlook the issues with it's underlying concept and just enjoy the adventure.

  Star trek is not like that. It has comedy but it has always shot for a more serious and dramatic tone. If you start throwing time travel into that as a main focus, it's going to end up feeling awkward and stale pretty quickly. I mean, how many times can you really watch a show about a ship equipped with a time travel transporter that sends crewman back and forth in time? How long before that starts to feel a bit like that old 'Time tunnel' show? 

   Besides, edging Star trek more towards another popular sci-fi show concept like Doctor who (or Firefly, Farscape, Stargate, B5, Battlestar Galactica, etc, etc) just waters it down and erodes it's unique identity. Star trek _needs_ to be Star trek. If it starts trying to be like whatever other show is popular, something important is lost in the process.",2,0,1444590744,1444729653
cvvva96,0,t1_cvvrbfb,StarTrekMike,"> Canon is only what we say it is

 I really hope this does not become a normal thing for Star trek. This was the case for Star wars and it became (predictably) a awful mess of poorly thought out fan-fiction like ideas that just got more and more convoluted in a effort to tie every loose end conveniently.

  I won't begrudge the creation of fan projects, I just don't think there is any real compelling reason to make them canon or even pretend they are canon.",12,0,1444578131,1444729653
cvvv5bc,0,t1_cvvnx3w,StarTrekMike,"I can't help but feel that a 29th century timeship based show would be a pretty bad idea in the long run.

  The big issue is identity. A typical Star trek show is centered around a crew that operates on a ship (or station) and deals with events as they come. This allows for a nice linear story that gives the show a specific flavor and identity. A show focused on a 29th century timeship would have problems with that. The time jumping would give each episode it's own flavor but the identity of the show as a whole would be muddled. There would be no consistent outside situation.

  The other big issue is stakes. A whole Trek show built on time travel would make just about any problem they encounter a trivial affair. They can fix just about every problem by traveling back and preventing it. That would get old pretty quick even if they had a great cast with fantastic dynamics and development.

  The final issue is the origins of the 29th century timeship concept itself. It's important to keep in mind that the whole idea was a after-thought. a gimmick that occasionally pops up during Voyager that was never actually developed or thought through to it's logical conclusions. (which is not surprising considering how Voyager's writing was handled as a whole.) 
  
  The whole timeship idea gives us the impression that Starfleet has shifted it's focus from dealing with space exploration to dealing with temporal matters. This means that there are _at least_ a handful of Wells class ships just kinda hanging out in space for no real reason while they use their transporters to send folks back and forth in time. The ship was a visual gimmick that served no real purpose since the transporter was actually the main feature. Why not just mothball those ships and do all your time transporting from a stationary location?

  As a aside that is also worth thinking about. A timeship idea is a great vehicle to reference old shows and crews but that is also a huge problem. The actors for _all_ the Trek shows are aging fast and many are well past doing Star trek again in any real capacity. You could probably pull a Trials and Tribblations for a couple of episodes but the cost and logistical difficulties of doing so would make that a short term solution to a long term problem.

  In short, the show seems like a interesting idea in theory but it would not really work in execution.

cvvkaow,0,t1_cvvj6gi,StarTrekMike,I have watched this video three times now and still don't really get what it is trying to do.,3,0,1444541268,1444729653

cvrfl1e,1,t3_3nufkt,StarTrekMike,"I think that it is very important that we really get specific about what a combat flight sim is and what makes them different from a air combat game.

  In the most modern terms. A combat flight simulator is going to be something close to DCS World and it's more complex modules (like the A-10C, MiG-21, etc). These are the kinds of simulators that reward the more dedicated player. The kind of player that is in it to learn all the details and master all the systems and tactics. These sims are built to be complex because the target market _burns_ for that level of complexity, a level that many developers are either unwilling or unable to provide.

  The other side is the air combat game. Here is where we get into titles like War Thunder, Ace Combat, HAWX, and others that are looking for fast paced action that appeals to a larger audience. These games are not going to give you complex systems to manage or even really require you to understand the basic physics of flight but they will provide a fun and sometimes even immersive experience.

  Between the two, there is no ""best"". It simply depends on what you are looking for as a player. Each type has a dedicated fanbase that is not going away any time soon.

  Now, with that stuff out of the way. Nobody really ""killed"" combat flight sims in the literal sense but big publishers certainly did not help. Electronic Arts had handled the Jane's combat sims but dropped them in 2000. Microprose was another heavy hitter in the combat flight sim market and they folded in 2001. 

  Now combat flight simulations are typically handled by smaller developers like Eagle Dynamics (and it's associative 3rd parties), and 1C Game studios. These companies put a lot of effort, money, and time into developing accurate flight sims. Creating a simulation on the level that they do involves a lot of time spent doing research and getting all the flight, system, sensor, and weapon data to be as close as possible to real life.

  The byproduct of this detail is usually high costs for the consumer. Those who may be perfectly happy to pay $60 for a game may find that paying $100 for IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad or even $60 _per aircraft_ in DCS World is not as acceptable. It's a issue of understanding the scale involved. Flight sims are expensive because they serve such a small audience and thus the price (helps) keep the audience small.

  The other big cost issue is peripherals. A good portion of DCS World aircraft modules assume that you not only have a good stick but also a throttle, rudder pedals, and even some form of head tracking. This can make for a high initial investment for any prospective player.

  Sadly, there is not a lot of middle ground these days. DCS World does include a handful of simplified aircraft (the aircraft associated with Flaming cliffs 3) and you can reduce the realism settings to ""game mode"" but most modules (aircraft) poorly implement the game mode since it is not widely used.

  IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad is a okay compromise. It's easy enough to pick up (since the aircraft and systems are not rendered in such fine detail) but it is still not going to be something you can just hop into without investing some time into learning and some money into a stick.

  Flight simulation is a niche genre. It won't ever die but big publishers have pretty much convinced gamers that they don't want to play stuff that complex anymore, probably so they don't have to invest the time and effort into making something that will be held to such high standards by the existing flight sim community.
