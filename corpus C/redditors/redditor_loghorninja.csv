For one of the best sunsets in Europe definitely head up to Piazzale Michelangelo.  Incidentally there is free parking up here for those that might find that useful.  If you're not familiar with sunset photography do not leave right after the sun sets.  It gets better for about 20 or so minutes.

One thing you should be prepared for in Italy though is very long lines to get into many museums.  Show up early and in my opinion, even though it kinda infuriates me, it's worth spending the extra money on the express line.  They will purposefully have the other line just stand there and you don't want that.  It can really make the a huge difference in your trip.

Also, Venice.  I personally despise Venice and think it's one of the worst places in Europe.  That's not to say that the city isn't amazing and beautiful but it's very religious and for the most part what you find there are pigeons, glass buyers, and absurdly rude and disrespectful Italians who will throw things at the gondolas and heckle the women which ruins a lot of the romantic atmosphere.  Try to maximize your time here by seeing the sights and just getting out.  Wear convertible clothes and be prepared for strict dress codes to see the religious sites.  This might mean having to stand in the blazing sun for a while before coming inside and having to be covered up.  Get up early to beat the crowds and don't linger - there are much better places to see.  Venice is really one of those places I don't recommend unless you're coming for Carnival.",2,0,1442686838,1444727226

What I don't think I'd do is build one unless you're keen on being customer support.  This might not be a problem but it's worth considering.  I've done it and didn't have problems with my mother but I know others who did.  A $200 dell pc would do the trick.",3,0,1442623865,1444727226

Whatever you do, don't order your parts until people can help you.",5,0,1442623632,1444727226

The point though is that with interest rates low and the dollar strong you can make 7% or more overseas plus get more for your money than you could a year ago.  I don't do it professionally but I do it because of my lifestyle.  I have about 20% of my equity overseas but wish it was more.  I have to wait until the stock market finishes correcting before it makes sense to take move funds outside the country.

The beauty of travel is our opinions.  I've definitely come to the realization in Italy though that with limited time amalfi can be a pretty big disappointment.  I was there in may of last year for example and we just kept on driving since without sun it's not very impressive at all.  At least with rain, places like Pompeii or Paestum give a mood that's quite interesting.",1,0,1442549336,1444727226
