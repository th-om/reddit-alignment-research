After seeing something like that, I'm sure they'd want to hear more of what Bernie has to say anyways :)",2,0,1444102179,1444722555

cvll6mt,0,t1_cvll1b1,vanillice,"People who argue against gun control citing the fact that the campus was a 'gun free zone' aren't likely to make the distinction between government-enforced and school-enforced. They're going to use the ineffectiveness of the latter in an attempt to prove the former can be ruled out. 

You're correct in that the school's code of conduct had a section about guns, though. I could only find one article on it, compared to the many about Oregon's ""campus carry"" law, but that article seemed legit.",-1,0,1443789277,1444722555
