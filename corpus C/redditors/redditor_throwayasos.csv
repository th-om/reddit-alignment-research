Different countries have different forms of constitutions, set up to act in different ways. 

Countries like NZ, UK and Canada set up their constituions in such a way as to allow the givernment to be as effective as possible and get their policies into action. This makes sense to these countries because it is important that if the people vote in a government, that govt should be able to carry out the people's wishes.

The United States takes a different perspective. The US has more checks and balances than just about any other country. The theory behind this is that change should be slow and difficult, so as to hinder the ability of a tyrant. It be have been impossible for Hitelr to do what he did in the US, ebcause of their consitutional structure. The theory behind this is that an important world superpower such as the US should have a number of limits to keep poer away from tyrants.
