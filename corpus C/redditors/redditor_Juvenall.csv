cvuqk43,1,t3_3o6gjf,Juvenall,"You'll have to get more specific in what you're looking for and what your budget is, but you can never go wrong with a pair of [Audio Technica ATH-M50X](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MMKZ7UE/). These are basically the standard for in-studio, closed-back circumaural headphones (the FIIO E6 in the linked package isn't a bad headphone amp, either). Mind you, however, that these are going to have a more neutral response than most as they're studio monitors. You'll get accurate, clear audio, but not booming bass (which for recording, I suggest against anyhow. Get a [SubPac](http://thesubpac.com/) if you want to level up your rig).

If you need one with a mic, the [Sennheiser PC 363D](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008O515CK/) is a great place to turn. These are open back, super comfortable, and the mic is about as decent as they come in this sort of setup. You'll get a LOT more color to your audio than with the M50X, but for more of a general purpose setup, these do a fine job. 

Now, here's where it gets more interesting. If you don't need the mic, you can basically shave off $200 by picking up a pair of the[ Sennheiser HD518](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042A68R8/), as they're practically the same thing without the mic or the audio dongle. You may want to invest in a headphone amp, but that's optional as these are not hard to drive. 

So, what do I use? I toggle between a pair of [JH Audio JH-16](http://www.jhaudio.com/product/jh16-pro-custom-ear-monitor) custom IEMs, which are great once you get used to talking and dealing with [bone conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_conduction), and my newest toy the [AKG K7xx Massdrop Editions](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/akg-k7xx-massdrop-first-edition-headphones) when I want some open-back love, with both being run through a [Ray Samules Intruder](http://www.raysamuelsaudio.com/products/intruder).",2,0,1444482767,1444717352
cvpdp49,0,t1_cvpcgic,Juvenall,"Assuming sarcasm here, so genuine question: Should Toledo Swords be liable if one of their decorative but completely ""functional"" blades be used in the commission of a crime? If they created them for a specific, non-criminal purpose and sold/distributed them in an established, regulated way (i.e. not to minors, or someone who says ""I'm going to cut someone""), what about someone's misuse or violation of intent gives way to responsibility? How far down the chain does this go when you factor in various levels of product distribution/indirect sales? If so, what's the distinction between one obvious weapon and the next? What about places that make other bladed products like, say, Chicago Cutlery? Is Louisville Slugger liable if I use one of their bats to attack someone?

Edit: Even in your example, should Pfizer really be responsible if my pharmacist and I collude to illegally sell their products without their knowledge, even though Pfizer knows this has occurred in the past with others? ",7,0,1444080980,1444717352
cvmnqlj,1,t3_3n7ebw,Juvenall,"Personally, I would set my sights as high as I'd ever be comfortable with. For me, that was the radio industry standard [Electro-Voice RE-20](http://www.amazon.com/Electro-Voice-RE-20-Cardioid-Microphone/dp/B000Z7LLQ0/) microphone. It clocks in at a heavy $450, but it's noise rejection, the unique and signature sound, it's reduction of a proxmity effect, and the shere quality of the damn thing (these these last 20+ years in real production studios), make it one of the best buys in microphones. Of course, with a mic like this, you'll need some other toys, too. I run mine into a [CloudLifter CL-1](http://www.amazon.com/Cloud-Microphones-CL-1-Cloudlifter/dp/B004MQSV04/) that converts phantom power into some ultra clean gain and then into the [DBX286s](http://www.amazon.com/DBX-286s-Microphone-Pre-amp-Processor/dp/B004LWH79A) to amp it up, compress, and noise gate it before it hits my old [Komplete Audio 6](http://www.amazon.com/Native-Instruments-Komplete-Audio-6/dp/B004YPRPJ6/).

cvirq65,0,t1_cvioi0d,Juvenall,"> Yes, I am very bitter about people who take away what little representation I have of genderlessness in any media.

What makes me sad here is that bitterness does detract from what could have been a valid, thoughtful conversation about the value of non-binary representation, opening others to the ideas that matter to so many. Instead of an expression of how this game has been meaningful to yourself (and I'm sure many others), it was an abrasive ad hominem of someone you don't know, who could have grown from your sharing, in a community that could only have improved by the experience. 

Is it fair to put that on you, or any one person? Absolutely not. However, we can only be more understanding when we're given an opportunity to understand. Don't tell people how they're wrong, show them why you're right and build consensus through compassion.

cvbdt6h,1,t3_3m13qb,Juvenall,"If you can establish that a) Your channel predates the current registration and b) the domain was purchased in bad faith with the sole intent of reselling to you (i.e. an email asking for more money than the base registration and administrative costs), you may have a shadow of a chance under ICANN's UDRP rules, but it's not a free process, nor is it a guaranteed one, especially if you haven't formally filed for trademark protection. 

You could also try to negotiate with the current owner. For example, if the name is unique enough, its unlikely to turn into something else or be stumbled upon by others, making it a difficult property to hold. Give them a stupid lowball offer and go from there. If they won't move, be ready to walk away. If you stick with your branding, they'll likely come back in a few weeks/months/years with a lower offer once they've been unable to unload. ",1,0,1443019930,1444717352
cv98uqn,1,t3_3lqgs4,Juvenall,"Photog here, and what I will tell you is that ""$150 or less"" doesn't really touch the ""reasonable"" range for decent work. To be clear, if that's all you can afford, that's totally fine, but if the budget is that tight, you need to set your expectations correctly and reevaluate if this is really something you want. Remember, photography is much like getting a tattoo in that you get what you really get what you pay for. Do you want a photo of two people standing next to each other, or do you want an image that captures a slice of your personalities in a way that 20, 30, 50 years down the road you can look back on? Do you want a hyper trendy ""filter photo"" that was thoughtlessly passed through a VSCO preset, or do you want something timeless? Do you want someone who tells you to smile, or someone who makes you smile? 

That said, make sure you're dealing with someone who has a proper contract. You need to know the number of photos you're expecting for your money, the number of outfit changes, the turn around time, who owns the copyrights, what paper your prints will be on, who's paying for permits, what your dispute process is if they come out awful, etc. Spend some time looking at their portfolio that's specific to engagement photography. Too many people think ""photog shoots great landscapes and ruin porn, therefore can shoot people just as well"". People photography is a VERY specific and specialized skill that isn't for everyone. While you're looking at the portfolio, avoid people who shoot clich√©s, especially if they have ANY photos of people on or around train tracks. Not only does this make them artistically bankrupt, but proper stupid ([Lots](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/md-teen-killed-train-photoshoot-girlfriend-article-1.2362855) [of](http://www.slrlounge.com/another-photographer-killed-during-photo-shoot-on-train-tracks/) [examples](http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/man-struck-killed-amtrak-train-auburn/ncs4L/) [on](http://petapixel.com/2015/07/24/photographer-killed-by-train-during-photo-shoot-in-fresno-ca/) [why](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/01/20/man-struck-and-killed-by-amtrak-train-while-trying-to-pose-for-pictures/), besides how over done they are.)

Just to stress, I'm not saying you can't get a good or even great photo in your price range, but don't go in expecting that and you'll be much better off. ",-1,0,1442858617,1444717352

It's an anti-abortion poster playing on the common argument on the pro-abortion side that what a woman chooses to do with her body is her choice alone. It's trying to play that against itself by showing behavior known to be harmful to a fetus and one most people already agree is irresponsible while expecting. The question it's trying to pose here is that if we all agree that smoking and/or drinking is unacceptable while being pregnant, why should an abortion be seen any differently.",60,0,1442153273,1444717352
cush6r4,1,t3_3juj8c,Juvenall,"If you're serious about wanting to fully enjoy the experience of a show without the awful ""muffle"" effect you get from cheap foam inserts, you're going to need to reach into your wallet quite a bit and pay for the quality. As a photographer and a music lover, I use a pair of [JH Audio's Musician's Earplugs](http://www.jhaudio.com/product/musicians-earplugs). They run around $125 US and are worth every damn penny. 

There are two real advantages to these over others. The first, is that they're custom molded to your ear, and your ear alone. So the fit is going to be perfect, and the isolation you're going to get will be unmatched. This does mean, however, a trip to the audiologist and adds another $25-50 depending the professional you pick (DIY kits can be had for ~15-25, but I'd rather pay the pro). The second is that you can get a filter that's right for your tolerance. 

What really sold me on these was my ability to still pick up on the details of the show, without feeling like I just stuck my fingers in my ear. Just as nice is that because they're custom, it's stupid easy to forget they're even in. Once I get going on a set, I don't even notice them there. The only real catch is remembering to clean them frequently, because they will get gross after a while otherwise.
