cvb4v33,1,t3_3m0yez,killerbrand,"Anecdotal, personal opinions:

Hillary - establishment candidate, very very likely to win nomination. Privacy stuff is concerning but otherwise she is well-vetted and has showed she understands Washington. Most likely 2016 president. 

Sanders - he's been very popular as an alternative candidate, which clearly shows that the populist left in america is growing. Won't win nomination, but his popularity clearly shows a desire among america's left that they want to be involved. He'll force Hillary to the left on some issues.

Webb, O'Malley, Chafee...yeah none of them approach relevancy.

Trump - extremely popular because he truly speaks his mind and is not afraid to go way outside party lines -  to the left (taxation on traders) or the right (border fence + mass deportation). His appeal is broad, but he'll eventually be brought down by 2 things - his arrogance/self-centrism, and his complete lack of knowledge in foreign policy and governance in general. Probably still ~50% chance he'll be the republican nominee.

Bush - In the absolute circus sideshow that Donald Trump has turned the 2016 republican nomination has turned into, its no wonder that bland, boring Jeb Bush has failed to stand out. This could be the republicans' undoing - his experience as governor and his liberal stance on immigration makes him the most likely republican to win the general election, if he can make it there.

Carson - great speaker and clearly a very smart man, another political outsider that is polling super well right now. Will probably do well due to the rare combination of being intelligent and being a right-leaning republican. Won't win primaries but he'll probably get a large portion of the further-right vote and some strong 2nd/3rd place finishes.

Fiorina - confident and a good speaker. successful as a businesswoman but her shortfalls are the same as Trump's - business knowledge does not translate to government & foreign policy knowledge.

Cruz - the Rick Santorum/Michelle Bachmann of this election. Keeping America's far right happy during the debates. Won't get more than a strong minority vote.

Paul - maybe the most honest politician you'll see on the trail. Doesn't have a real chance of winning but is popular enough to  keep issues of privacy and foreign policy on everybody's tongues

Rubio - not a good speaker, and doesn't have enough conviction in his positions to effectively distance himself from the competition. Seems like the kind of guy who might be effective 10-15 years from now, just not enough experience yet.

Huckabee - no chance. Has his same 5% of supporters that he's had the whole time. Says outrageous things every so often to keep his name in the news cycle. Irrelevant.

Kasich - Jon Huntsman of this race. Too centrist to ever have a chance at a republican nomination. Irrelevant as huckabee, but much smarter.

cvb3ulh,0,t1_cv43ard,killerbrand,Jarome is the best as of now (Subban isnt even 2nd yet) but if PK continues his trajectory hes on now i think he will be. Won't be able to call that for 10 years tho,1,0,1442989333,1444725175
cvb3tby,0,t1_cval0w7,killerbrand,"Over the last month or so, Goins has contributed offensively as least as much as Tulowitzki, the difference at the plate hasn't been huge. What IS huge is the difference between Tulowitzki and Pennington in the lineup. Goins has established himself as a very good (not great) middle infielder in all facets. Pennington is a solid defensive player but having him in the batting order instead of Tulo creates a legimate hole, which we really didn't have before. You also lose the unbelievable defense on shortstop that Tulo brings.",3,0,1442989212,1444725175
cvb3kbc,0,t1_cvaw1kf,killerbrand,"Man it wouldn't surprise me at all if he keeps going in AAA. His stats for the year are actually pretty good, 3.46 ERA. If he can be sort of like a mentor to younger pitchers and perform well i absolutely can see how he could be of value to the system.",3,0,1442988357,1444725175
cvb39oe,1,t3_3m14da,killerbrand,"Good review with mostly good points. Strongly disagree with what they said about their lack of chemistry though idk, I always think these 2 sound great together. Stylistically this is more of a Future tape but Drake makes great additions to most of the songs. Wouldve gave it closer to an 8 but i get what theyre saying",1,0,1442987397,1444725175
