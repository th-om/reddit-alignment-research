Darkest Hour I believe is based off the HOI2 engine. 

HOI3 they introduced a lot of AI features - you can create theaters/armies and assign them territory and set the AI to manage them to attack/defend. Although its not the greatest, it does reduce some micro management. ",1,0,1443731321,1444731814
