cvedx9x,0,t1_cvdzfcx,carphanatik,"Just some insight, my mom and dad divorced when I was 6 months old due to his alcoholism. I used to spend some weekends with him when I was young, but that ended before I was 10. I don't remember talking to him in middle or high school other than maybe one call a year when he would tell me how much he loves me and my mom. Most times I would stay quiet, since I couldn't sincerely repeat it back to him. He came to my HS graduation in 2006 and my wedding last year, and occasionally to Christmas at my grandma's house (his mom), but I probably only saw him in person 4 times in roughly 20 years.

He died in February this year. After his death, I found out how similar we are. His and my personalities are/were almost interchangeable. His alcoholism was pretty much his only negative attribute, and he was not a mean drunk by any means, but it is the reason I never got to know him. I regret that I knew so little about him, and I still don't know much. I keep putting myself in his shoes, imagining how ashamed or embarrassed he may have been for not having control of his life. It was probably hard for him, knowing I was so similar to him, that he had no part in my life. I find myself tearing up just writing this.

Anyway, I'm not sure of your situation and what led to your current relationship with your father. All I know is that I made it extremely difficult for him to be any part of my life, and now all I can think of is how he probably felt every time I was silent on the other end of the phone after he told me he loved me. He made his fair share of mistakes, but he was still a person. Now he's gone forever.",5,0,1443229668,1444724458
