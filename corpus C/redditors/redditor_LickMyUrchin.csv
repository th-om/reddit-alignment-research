cvuo61s,0,t1_cvuhq2k,LickMyUrchin,"I really hate the edgy comments about *1984* becoming reality, but it is a beautifully written novel, and a great critique of authoritarianism, especially considering the historical context. What books do you think are much better novels on this topic? ",4,0,1444473128,1444726208

cvoquzr,0,t1_cvn8sda,LickMyUrchin,"Nice meme. I'm not trying to be brave. Just saying, I presume in a hundred or a thousand years those are the things that seem like obvious practices which new technology or research will render outdated. You could've come up with other potential issues or argued against it, but stay memeing",0,0,1444035404,1444726208
