cvvwdu4,1,t3_3o9ooo,nimbusnacho,"Looks like if this bothers you that much, you have to unfortunately find a new place. Being month to month and not having a written lease to fall back on in the event he takes you to court to evict you (he'd have to do that first, can't just throw your shit outside). Even if it's not legal for him to evict you based on the bike alone, it's month to month so if you don't follow what he wants, you'll be out of a home soon enough anyway.

Really dude, let this be a lesson that 'verbal leases' are bullshit, there's a reason people get year leases and have them written up. It's to protect you as much as the landlord. The verbal agreement may in fact be legal, but will make your life so much harder if you ever have to go to court over anything.",3,0,1444580210,1444720904
cvstvgc,0,t1_cvstl39,nimbusnacho,"music festivals used to be underground?

How about because instead of being able to see your favorite band in an environment meant for music and a certain number of people to (somewhat) comfortably enjoy the experience, you're forced to spend hundreds to try to cram yourself into a herd of sweaty drugged up assholes to try to somewhat hear them?

(I actually don't mind festivals that much, but they are a completely different experience than an actual music venue and pretending otherwise is stupid).",6,0,1444332392,1444720904

Not sure exactly how libertarianism would be against unionizing. It would be a group of people collectively bargaining with a company for certain benefits and ideally wouldn't involve government regulation. Am I wrong?",10,0,1444325587,1444720904
cvsm1x2,0,t1_cvsgbvs,nimbusnacho,"You don't think actors are just as easily replaced? I'd say there's probably more skilled non-union actors than skilled developers.

Now that I think about it, it's sort of insane that developers haven't unionized in a similar way.",11,0,1444320976,1444720904
cvslzb3,0,t1_cvseqgg,nimbusnacho,"Its easy to say that because, of course, those people ARE more integral to the game than VA. However there's a huge trend making games more cinematic and GOOD voice actors are a huge part of that. You have to properly pay people for the things you want. If VAs demand more money, you either give it to them or go another route. If the pay is lopsided, that's more the studio's fault than anything else.",0,0,1444320875,1444720904

Also shitty that your mom ratted you out. Way to stamp out any twin-fun that you guys may have done later in life, early.",1,0,1444310551,1444720904

Side note: If you can, invest in a new editing computer, I did earlier this year and it's a woooooooooorld of difference.
