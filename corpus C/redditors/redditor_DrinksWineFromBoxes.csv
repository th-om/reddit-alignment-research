I grew up on a farm where we raised cattle in a very humane way.  But, I remember the way they would panic when I would drive the truck to the slaughter house.  They knew what was happening.  That is why I no longer eat meat.

cutxomq,0,t1_cutxcc1,DrinksWineFromBoxes,"> It's heading in the right direction. Money used to turn less-close elections than it can now.

The full effect of Citizens United is just kicking in this election cycle.  The Koch brothers alone are going spend $1B and that doesn't include all the other sociopathic billionaires that will be trying to buy this election.  If we get a hard right president who packs the Supreme Court with hard core conservative zealots then the country is done.

So you think people are demanding the services provided by Goldman Sachs (and the rest of the finance industry)?  Or do you think they thrive on fraud?  

And, if they thrive on fraud (which is obvious) how do you propose to correct the situation now that Citizens United exists?

cutwm70,0,t1_cutwe2h,DrinksWineFromBoxes,"So the Republicans win.  Okay.  The Democrats have tried to create a Fox News equivalent, but for whatever reason it just does not work for Democrats.  

So, the super rich will get all of the Fox News morons to vote to create an oligarchy.  That is pretty much already in place.  I am puzzled as to why you seem to be okay with that.

cutvklm,0,t1_cuts03t,DrinksWineFromBoxes,"It is hard to change people's minds with media.  Although, if you look at Fox News given enough time you can do it to some degree.

What really works with political advertising is to get the people who already agree with you spun up with fear and anger so they vote in droves.  That is what the Republican party and Fox News have been so successful at.  They keep the base scared and angry and they turn out to vote at much higher rates than other blocks.
