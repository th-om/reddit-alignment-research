In fact, it's attitudes like this that led to packed-to-the-brim prisons full of offenders who had been caught selling pot 3 times and were forced into life sentences.",26,0,1444172645,1444719959
cvnh01b,0,t1_cvngtlf,zerow6789,I'm getting that from the pic. I guess I'm confused about what mistake the NASA artist apparently made. It's clear to me that the left image is The Martian and the right image is the real life NASA equivalent being testedon Earth. Is there something wrong about that?,2,0,1443931933,1444719959

cvn4amb,1,t3_3nc2e5,zerow6789,"I don't think it's ever really been framed as the US having more mentally ill individuals but rather that we don't have a great system for helping them. This is then coupledwith the fact that we allow the ownership of firearms and while the rules are there to properly track them, the infrastructure and practice easily falls apart due to funding issues and loopholes such as gifting a gun to a family member.",2,0,1443906827,1444719959

cuxt4to,1,t3_3khxq6,zerow6789,"He recently did an interview on the Mission Log Podcast that hits a lot of these notes. Much of the staff did not want to work with a kid and did not want to write the character. This leads to a lot of episodes without him at all, or only in one scene just helping one of the principals.

Specifically he did not get along with the producers, especially Maurice Hurley. Wil told a story about the start of Season 3. He was going to take a summer break from the show to go work on a movie and expand his career, but Hurley wouldn't allow him out of the shooting schedule/ contract whatever because the first episode they were filming (ep 2 of season 3 I believe) was supposed to have a Wesley B arc or something. He filmed all these scenes for the episode, and then Hurley had it all cut down to just one three minute scene basically to show Wil he was at the mercy of the production staff.

Luckily he has built a second fame for himself these days and seems to be happy, but it all seems like Wesley was a screwed character from the start. By proximity, Beverley Crusher suffers as a character as well because she comes off as such a basic ""Mom"" character and never really develops past Wesley's mother or Picard's unrequited love.",2,0,1441972326,1444719959
