cvutxpq,1,t3_3o6q5o,WackyXaky,"Street widening and to an even greater extent highway widening does NOT reduce time spent in traffic. It sounds counter-intuitive, but you can't really make traffic less of a problem except by a massive reduction in population (such as in many rust belt cities) while preventing an expansion in suburbs (unlike many rust belt cities). The only real thing a city can do is provide viable alternatives to driving (walking, public transit, bicycling, etc) and use urban planning that promotes dense mixed use developments. 

LA is doing well on increasing driving alternatives but only okay on promoting more density and mixed use developments.",3,0,1444491042,1444716693

cvrrv2s,0,t1_cvrfyes,WackyXaky,"Do you mind expanding on what type of voter fraud you think could be widespread without getting caught? While voter fraud is hard to catch in cases of someone impersonating another voter they know is not going to vote, those circumstances are difficult to see happening on a large scale. Election fraud with ballot stuffing, pay to vote, false registrations, etc are much easier to catch (because it is a conspiracy involving multiple actors), they also are not being targeted by the current crop of voter ID laws.",2,0,1444254069,1444716693
cvrrfpv,0,t1_cvrq9kb,WackyXaky,"Universities/colleges do probably one of the most thorough background checks that a person will ever experience in their life. You have to provide more records and proof of ID than to get a driver's license (SS# for the student and parents, ID of the student, medical records, educational records, references, etc). If it's a public university, where the majority of students tend to get their higher educations, those IDs are issued by the state. 

So, given this information, why would non-standard IDs like firearm IDs take precedence over a student ID? Keep in mind, the ID is to verify the voter is who they say are AFTER going through voter registration already.",2,0,1444253409,1444716693
