cvufcd2,0,t1_cvuf2wb,HoliHandGrenades,"> Egypt hates Hamas as much as Israel does.

""Egypt"" doesn't hate Hamas.  The leaders of the current military dictatorship in Egypt are certainly afraid of Hamas and anyone that might inspire the Egyptian people to challenge their authority, but the two previous Egyptian governments were actually friendly with Hamas.

They did, of course, have to bow to the power of Israeli threats of military action and American threats to cut off humanitarian aid, but that's real politic, not hatred.

I encourage you to learn more about reality, rather than reveling in the security of pleasing falsehoods.",-1,0,1444443656,1444721585

cvue2bd,0,t1_cvudfde,HoliHandGrenades,"Israel never ended the control of the Gaza Strip.  The blockade was less onerous and comprehensive between 2005 and 2007, when it was expanded to prevent the import into the Gaza Strip of dangerous items like cardimom, crayons and wheelchairs to put the Palestinians ""on a diet"" to collectively punish them for the actions of Hamas, but it existed the whole time.

I'm not saying you are dumb, but you are certainly ignorant.

As for Egypt, as you should know -- if you have any knowledge on the subject -- Israel threatened to re-invade the Philidelphi Corridor if Egypt did not assist Israel with the blockade.  Get educated.",-2,0,1444440997,1444721585

You know, except for negotiating with the Palestinian leaders...  How do you not know that unilaterally declaring that they would not negotiate, and instead would seize the territory they wanted through force of arms was an act of war?

Are you being purposefully obtuse for some reason?

The Israelis committing that act of war is not, in and of itself, good or evil.  It is simply a fact.",-9,0,1444419630,1444721585
