cvxowv6,1,t3_3g2xm9,GTS250,"I never had automatic updates, just a little thingy on my phone. I left civilization for a short time, couldn't post, got out of the habit and never really came back. Sorry I didn't write this far sooner, this came out when I was away from the world (part two!) and that's my bad.

I was looking into getting a bot to automatically post the updates. It's rather easy to post 'em instantly, but I wanted an hour delay after the comic came out (so that other people could check, see, and post for themselves, getting some easy karma and maybe sending more traffic to the sub) and neither my nearly useless coding skill nor any of the prebuilt options I could find were up to that task. 

I've been meaning to get back into this subreddit (and back to making chupaquesos, because they're delicious and hilariously full of calories), but unless I can get a working, non-instant bot my schedule is generally too full to post it on time, and I'm going to forget otherwise. 

Then again, I could get back into trying.",1,0,1444702381,1444720881

Like, I drive the speed limit taking a date home, where I normally go about 5 over (depending on roads, traffic, ect., but you get the meaning). There's a hell of a difference between that (the sort of thing everyone assumes this post is about) and what /u/Pigeon_Stomping described.",4,0,1444569728,1444720881

cvvcdzd,0,t1_cvvayie,GTS250,"You're starting to see why a lot of pro-gun people are really goddamn confused about gun control laws.

That said, as someone who is heavily pro-gun: the reason the magazine placement would be considered an important issue is because it is a de-facto ban on the AR-15, the most popular rifle in the united states, which [looks like this](http://imgur.com/a/3zBiy). They're black, they're scary, they're ""assault weapons"" and you can usually garner enough support to ban them because it doesn't impact most hunters. [Here](http://www.assaultweapon.info/) is a relatively balanced explanation of what an ""assault weapon"" is, and why they're trying to ban the whole category. 

Might I ask what parts of gun control you strongly support? I'm not going to argue against any of it, because _time_, but I'd be interested to hear what you support.",8,0,1444525502,1444720881
