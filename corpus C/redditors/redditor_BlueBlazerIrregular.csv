Ensuring the natural wonders of our nation are protected for both the citizens and wildlife is a moral imperative. In both the christian sense and the philosophical sense.,8,0,1444419794,1444728399

Almost 300 million visitors to 370 national parks.  This is something everyone uses, and since we know that the private sector is not responsible enough to maintain these things properly or will sell off land to corporate interests I think it's safe to say that it's in the people's best interest to keep and maintain these things.

cvrn36a,0,t1_cvrl7m5,BlueBlazerIrregular,"I tried to do the mental gymnastics that brought you to these equivalencies and simply can not do it. 

First, One would expect the military to show up for any peace missions armed as most peace missions occur in some very unpeaceful places.   

Next, saying you are peacefully demonstrating while holding a weapon is exactly the type of action that most reasonable people consider to be outright intimidation.  It completely negates any thought of peaceful assembly.

Of course that completely ignores why these people are actually there.  Which is the hope that there will be some sort of conflict with the authorities so they can show the world how much they need their guns to protect themselves from the gubbmint.  That thinly veiled secondary purpose of armed conflict cannot be considered peaceful no matter how you look at it.  You see this routine or out right intimidation over and over with these people.  Those armed thugs that showed up at the bundy ranch for example.

They are exactly the kind of shit bags you do not want walking around in public armed because they will start shooting.   It's why law enforcement is afraid to confront them and why the FBI considers these people to be domestic terrorists. ",-2,0,1444247079,1444728399

cvri338,0,t1_cvr81oc,BlueBlazerIrregular,"The ethics investigative group isn't made up of congressmen.  They are office workers basically.  It's done so that what you fear can't happen.  

Now there are 10 congressmen that oversee things, but they are evenly split between dems and repubs at 5 each.  Except...Trey Gowdy and Susan Brooks are up to their necks in the Benghazigate bullshit and will be forced to recuse themselves.  Which will leave the remaining committee stacked with Dems.  

What is going to be really interesting is what will happen afterwards.  Because these guys obviously broke federal law.  So once the report is released reguardless of how light or heavy the committee sets it's punishment the FBI and the DOJ are going to get to take a crack at it.   This is really really bad news for the republicans.  ",8,0,1444239832,1444728399
