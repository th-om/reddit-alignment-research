cvccbq0,0,t1_cvc7v4l,Sautygera,"> allowing states to ban abortion and defunding planned parenthood are two huge mistakes

The abortion issue is independent of fiscal conservatism, but I would think state funding of abortions wouldn't be. I'm probably mistaken in assuming that fiscal conservatives view taxation from an individual moral lens where taxation is characterized as an act of theft or coercion (that might be more of a minarchist or anarcho-capitalist position). 

But if that were the case, federal funding for any of Planned Parenthood's services (money is fungible) inevitably leads to theft at the barrel of a gun, from those who believe abortion is an evil, to fund the same.",-3,0,1443079520,1444724768
