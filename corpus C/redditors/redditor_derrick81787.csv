The host asked him something about gun control as it related to Jews in Nazi Germany. Carson said something along the lines of how the Holocaust would have been much more difficult to pull off had the Jews been armed. Then the host asked Carson about gun control and Obama. Carson answered but made it very clear that the current American government is not comparable to the Nazis, but the host kept bringing it up. It honestly felt like a trap to me, but Carson didn't fall for it.",1,1,1444711966,1444724564
cvxdg6p,1,t3_3ohvro,derrick81787,"I don't know if they are all the same or not, but I do think that it's basically impossible to tell the difference ahead of time. I mean, none of the rebels wear uniforms, and if you were to see one ISIS member and one non-ISIS rebel standing next to each other, it would be impossible to tell the difference. It seems to me like ISIS could easily send in spies to infiltrate the other rebel groups and that it would be practically impossible for anyone to know. There is also the problem that ISIS and the other rebels are technically on the same side when it comes to the war against Assad. That means that even if they are two distinct groups, they might still occasionally work as allies. Plus, ISIS seems to have a lot of money and support. That means that even if they are two distinct groups and even if none of the other rebels become allies with ISIS, ISIS might very well be able to defeat the other rebel groups and simply take those rebels' weapons for themselves. In my opinion, all of this adds up to say that we should not be arming rebels in Syria.

Also, I don't think that Assad is a great guy or anything, but I don't think we should be removing him. He is harsh and has definitely done things that the West would consider to be human rights violations, but look at what he's working with. His biggest and most formidable opposition is ISIS. There are many other terrorist groups and hard-line Islamists in and around Syria as well. When you are a secular ruler surrounded by people like that, it might unfortunately be necessary to execute a few every once in a while. Otherwise, they will take over the country, execute you and your entire family, and set up Sharia law. The West has a difficult time accepting this because we operate so differently, but I do believe that Middle Eastern rulers like Assad should be given a little more leeway than other governments. I'm not saying turn a blind eye to everything, but we should be considering what the alternative governments would be like before we oust someone like Assad.",0,0,1444684347,1444724564

It comes down to the fact that Monty knows where the car is and intentionally eliminated all but one of the goats while the contestant simply chose a door at random.",1,0,1444681532,1444724564

cvx9cm3,1,t3_3nw0um,derrick81787,"Haha! Declaring the NRA a terrorist organization, and therefore declaring it's 4.5 million members to be terrorists, is a 100% fool-proof way to start a very bloody war. What other option is there, once that many people are officially declared to be enemies of the state? It wouldn't just be 4.5 million people, either. It would be those people and many more sympathetic supporters who just never got around to buying an NRA membership.

Britain just chose to give credit to Gandhi because a person starving himself is no threat but a person killing police officers and throwing bombs into the Central Legislative Assembly is. It makes sense that a government would seek to promote behavior like Gandhi's while not even mentioning a person like Singh.",2,0,1444675748,1444724564
cvx5svm,1,t3_3o3ytr,derrick81787,"Carson is obviously right that the Jews would have been at least a little better off if they were armed. I mean, better off than the Holocaust is an incredibly low bar. It's amazing to me that people can disagree with his statement.",1,0,1444673431,1444724564
cvx5b90,0,t1_cvurb4n,derrick81787,"I don't understand why people give a crap about what Gandhi thinks. He went on a hunger strike to protest British colonial rule, Britain had mercy on him and gave in. They could have just as easily let him starve.

There were a lot of other things going on in India at the time, including violent resistance. Somehow, I don't believe that Gandhi was the deciding factor here.

This is a little tinfoil-hatty, but I think that governments intentionally credit peaceful protesters for changes the government was forced to implement in an effort to promote peaceful protest and deter violent resistance. India had violent resistance, but Gandhi and his hunger strikes are given most of the credit for India's independence. During the American civil rights movement, the Black Panthers, Malcom X, and others sometimes advocated violence, but Martin Luther King and his peaceful protests are given most of the credit for creating change. People are taught that violence is never the answer (it usually isn't, but ""never"" is a strong word) and that peaceful protests tend to work. Personally, I tend to think that peaceful protests rarely work and that the ones we hear about are exceptions and were aided by the violent resistance that was also happening at the same time.

Obviously the peaceful protests had some effect, but I think that's only because violence was also happening. Peaceful protests are easy to simply ignore, but violence isn't. Violence forces *something* to be done, and then at that point the government choses to negotiate with the peaceful protesters.

Without the corresponding violence and other forms of resistance happening in India at the time, Britain would have just allowed Gandhi to starve without a second thought.",2,0,1444672722,1444724564
