I would say that an academic specializing in law has the kind of intellectual tools to help him become knowledgeable about foreign affairs.  Especially when that person has lived abroad and has family roots from a different country.  ",6,0,1441565363,1444721836

It's interesting that [in this bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FveXB_-W3HM) he uses some of the same scatological humor to deal with dark themes that I was talking about in my post above.  He talks about using farts to defuse the tension on September 11.  ",0,0,1440450809,1444721836
cue790e,1,t3_3i75kd,het_het,"I'm American and I think Louis CK is a philosopher.  He is one of the most insightful comedians working today.  He does a really good job of grappling with some pretty dark parts of our nature, identifying some of the most troubling, subconscious beliefs that I think a lot of us have.  The humor that he uses to deal with these topics is, I think, quintessential American male humor - vulgar potty humor.  I grew up with that kind of humor and a good poop joke just makes me laugh.  A poop joke about what makes us human and personal identity is even more entertaining for me (I saw him do this joke last night when I was watching one of his acts on Netflix).  I think Louis CK is saying some pretty insightful things and sugar coating it with a style of humor that he and most American males grew up with.  

The same is true for Southpark.  Southpark is high quality satire.  Trey Parker and Matt Stone use a lot of absurd scatological humor to get their message across, but they often make really interesting points.  My mom (who is British) can't stand Southpark, and I can't blame her because she didn't grow up with that kind of humor, but she is missing out on some good satire.  And I'm sure she would happily go watch Book of Mormon on Broadway, even though it's the same kind of satire coated with the same kind of vulgar humor written by the same writers as Southpark.  

I watch a lot of the panel shows, so I know about and love British humor, too.  What are some of the more insightful British comedians working today?",1,0,1440443496,1444721836

I assume that its supports would no longer be able to hold it and it would collapse in on the building, taking out a large number of congressmen.  Not only would our government be paralyzed, but the country would be plunged into uncertainty about the cause of the collapse, with conspiracy theories and worries about terrorist attacks abounding.",24,0,1439761537,1444721836
