cvm8tzq,0,t1_cvm0tys,PerfectGentleman,"Right, if he's an atheist and deliberately singled-out Christians in his killing spree, we should acknowledge that. But so far the evidence that he was an atheist is not there, so we shouldn't jump to conclusions yet. It seems like some people criticizing this article are doing just that and are blasting on people for being skeptical. 

We may never know the truth, and that's okay. One thing that we should all realize is that we should always be on a path of understanding and self-reflection. We shouldn't need a tragedy like this to acknowledge that as atheists we're still vulnerable to a plethora of human weaknesses.",27,0,1443827752,1444721710
cvm7n3l,0,t1_cvm2o1i,PerfectGentleman,"Not really. It makes the reasons for the violence more complex, but not excusable. Not all atheists hate religion, but it's a common theme. Someone who hates all religions could be driven to violence due to this hatred. It wouldn't be because he was an atheist, it would be because he hated religion. Atheism is a description of what someone doesn't believe. It makes no sense to blame that.",7,0,1443825518,1444721710
