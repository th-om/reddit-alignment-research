cvmkbre,1,t3_3n7zqs,progliberal,I'm really hoping this is all a joke. I would rather date Bill Cosby than go near this fucking creep.,1,0,1443856118,1444724190
cvewejg,0,t1_cvesps4,progliberal,"Where did I say we should kill Latinos? I said unwanted fetuses should be aborted. 

I really don't see how I'm selfish here. I aborted one fetus; I didn't murder millions of people. I understand that you have insane beliefs about unborn things having a right to live, but that doesn't give you the right to force your stupidity on others.

Here's something you should consider: if I were to suddenly get pregnant and be forced to keep the child, I would have to stop drinking immediately. There would be a very good chance that I would die from delirium tremens if I did that. I realize that I live an incredible unhealthy lifestyle, but that's my choice. Would it be better for me to die from withdrawal, killing the baby with me, or to abort it and survive? You say the right to live is so important, so what about my right live?",0,0,1443284756,1444724190
cvesfuk,0,t1_cvepshn,progliberal,"Lol, medical costs aren't covered by the government. It would be great if it did, but Republican assholes like you keep that from happening. Any man that wants to control women is a pig. I'm not going through all the bullshit of pregnancy(medical costs, sickness, inability to use booze and drugs) just so a prick like you can sleep soundly knowing that people are being saved. The world is overpopulated as it is, why should we bring more unwanted people into it?",0,0,1443276650,1444724190
cvekyhn,0,t1_cvekk6h,progliberal,Anyone stupid enough to think a small collection of cells in my stomach is a human is a fucking moron. They have no right to tell me how to live my life.,-2,0,1443247141,1444724190
cvekr0w,0,t1_cveaz6f,progliberal,"1. It's not that simple. It includes 9 months of awful bullshit, not to mention the medical costs. Then there's the awful feeling that something I created is living a horrible life in an orphanage.

2. Bitch you don't know me. I use birth control, but it isn't 100% effective. Why do you think you should be able to force me to ruin my life because of a medical anomaly. ",0,0,1443246452,1444724190
