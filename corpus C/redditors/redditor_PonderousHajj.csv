cvwizvb,0,t1_cvwigdx,PonderousHajj,"Working as a political scientist, however, I can tell you that it's still not a favorable map for Republicans in 2016. But that's another story, entirely.

I'm saying this that, as mass shootings occur in the internet age, public opinion will almost undoubtedly shift in favor of tougher laws. If anything, the industry should create its own system of self-regulation, and preempt the government.",2,0,1444618035,1444725752
cvwi42p,0,t1_cvwhljr,PonderousHajj,"First off, don't pull that kind of condescending bull on the subject of my intelligence. That's not helpful in any argument. And, again, I am a gun owner, myself.

I do, however, see the writing on the walls. I do not think we've compromised as much as you say since the '30s when you look at the types of firearms available now when compared to then. I also don't really think that background checks and stricter laws are going to do anything. Anyone with an internet connection and a basic understanding of Tor can get whatever kind of gun they want, regardless of what the government says.

What I'm saying is that some kind of reform is inevitable, so we need to be more engaged in what comes out of it. Stamping our feet is not going to do anything.

And personally, I'd like to see the NRA work with mental health advocacy groups, because the *real* problem isn't the guns, but the fact that our country treats its mentally ill like a third-world nation.",3,0,1444616438,1444725752
cvwenfe,1,t3_3obp20,PonderousHajj,"Our Second Amendment still calls for a ""well-regulated militia,"" and even though I and my family are gun owners, I still think we're falling short on the regulated part.

I would much rather see firearms treated like automobiles. I don't want any taken away, or banned, but I wanna see mandatory training, licensing, and insurance. It both astounds and frightens me just how many people I know who own guns and have never taken a course on gun safety and etiquette.

It's those who wield their guns with hubris and stupidity that are the biggest threats to our right to bear arms. I mean, even the NRA is shirking any discussion of personal responsibility when it comes to owning firearms, and instead is doing whatever it can to benefit the industry, as opposed to actual gun owners.

Given everything that's happened, within the next decade there's going to be some kind of comprehensive gun control legislation at the federal level. That's inevitable. Gun owners and the industry have an opportunity to get involved with it, but the loudest actors on behalf of them both seem more interested in whining.",4,0,1444610244,1444725752
