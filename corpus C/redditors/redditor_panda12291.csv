Right, that's why we have a single payer healthcare system and an open immigration policy.  

Every bill that came out of the Pelosi-Reid congress included a great deal of compromise to conservatives.  Remember the death of the Public Option?  That was all to get some Republicans on board, though even that wasn't enough to get them to break party lines apparently, despite the fact that the final draft of the ACA looks quite similar to a plan that was proposed by the Chamber of Congress and supported by Republicans in the 90s.  

Recently it is the Republicans who refuse to pass anything that is not 100% ideologically pure.  That's why the last congress was the least productive in history.  

Governing requires compromise.  The new speaker can do one of two things- he can govern or he can remain ideologically pure, but it is impossible to do both.


Edit: to those of you saying that the compromises were all about getting more conservative Dems on board- my point stands that the leaders made compromises to their ""ideological purity"" to get legislation passed.  That is exactly what the far-right is refusing to do.  Just as the democratic party did not all have one mindset, there will be republicans who disagree with the more conservative factions of their party.  The new speaker will have to be able to make compromises to bring the disparate parts of his party together in order to actually govern.  ",25,0,1444398138,1444718446

I realize you're probably looking for free replays, and I'm sure there are some out there, but I've only ever gotten replays from streams I sub to.  

BaseTradeTV is the most consistent of the streamers I follow. They always send out all the replays they have pretty much as soon as whatever tournament or showmatch they're casting is over.  

For me, at least, the content plus the replays is definitely worth the $5 a month for the sub.  ",2,0,1444222178,1444718446

It seems that people think that either he will be the one who is actually running things, or that they are so much the same person that she will make decisions in the exact same way he did.

They do tend to have fairly similar policy positions on a lot of things, but I think their tactics would be quite different, and the world is very different than it was two decades ago, so even coming from the same conceptual framework, her policies today would be different than they were in the 90s.

Amazingly enough, Hillary is a brilliant woman with a mind of her own.  If she supports TTP it will be because she believes in free trade and international cooperation and thinks that this deal will be a net positive for America, not because she just wants to do the same thing as Bill.

With a [combined net worth of $100 billion](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-06/koch-brothers-worth-100-billion-lead-oil-moguls-on-rise) they're not even going to notice that's missing. 

They're only worth that, however, as long as their energy company continues to flourish. 

Most of their wealth is in their company, [Koch Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_Industries), which they hold privately.  Though it now has a number of unrelated subsidiaries, Koch Industries' main business is oil.  They stand to lose billions in value if stricter environmental regulations are passed and stricter regulations are put in place on corporate behavior.  Any loss of business that the keystone deal would bring them is really nothing compared to that.  

They sponsor candidates who support the pipeline because those same candidates will support the Kochs' energy agenda and earn them billions more in the future.

That's why I said higher taxes on the wealthy rather than higher income taxes, which aren't really effective in higher tax brackets and tend to hit the middle class more.

The Koch's candidates, by contrast, tend to be in favor of completely eliminating capital gains taxes, often favoring more regressive substitutes like higher sales taxes.  ",6,0,1443981306,1444718446

They start with G below middle C and for the C chord keep that low G, but add a root position C above that.  The chorus again seem to be just root position triads moving in parallel motion.  

Edit- just wanted to add that the intro also appears to be root position chords (except for the G, which I guess is technically in 2nd inversion with the 5th doubled at the octave) starting below middle C but with the added octave.  ",3,0,1443979135,1444718446

They support candidates who are in favor of higher taxes on the wealthy and on businesses because they believe it is for the benefit of society as a whole.

The Kochs give money to candidates whose policies will benefit them financially. They stress lower taxes for the highest income earners, lower regulations on businesses and anti-climate science, all of which they stand to gain from personally.  They may truly believe that these things will benefit society, but it looks a lot like they are trying to game politics for personal gain.  ",1,0,1443977973,1444718446
