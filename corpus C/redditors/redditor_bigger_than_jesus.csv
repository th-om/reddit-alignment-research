And I'm not ""only"" worried about mass shootings or killings caused by people with guns. Not sure where you got that. Worrying about mass shootings does not take away from worrying about terrorist attacks. Worry is not some currency that can only be spent on a finite number of atrocities.",1,0,1443926396,1444719955
cvnbvaw,0,t1_cvn6wjs,bigger_than_jesus,"When we're talking about these types of mass killings, they want to shoot people. It's distinct from McVeigh because it's not based on ideology. I think for them, shooting someone gives them power. Their victims' fear makes them feel powerful, something they've longed for. I feel it's that brew of American gun culture and loneliness or rejection that gives rise to these mass shootings.",1,0,1443921310,1444719955
cvn5qte,0,t1_cvn5c33,bigger_than_jesus,"Excellent point. I was going to go into that, but I wanted to stick to the specific problem of mass shootings. No matter what, people can always cause mass death. Even if there were no mass shootings, there can be mass knife attacks, [like in China](http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/01/world/asia/china-railway-attack/). Or bombing. Or whatever.

cvmzr0l,0,t1_cvmy8tr,bigger_than_jesus,"> lack of belief in the existence of God or gods.

That's what I said. I lack a belief in God's existence. How is this different than agnosticism? It's not, in the true sense of the word. BUT, people don't use the term ""agnostic"" to describe a lack of belief. When people say ""agnostic"" it almost implies a 50/50 chance of God's existence. ""I can't say that God does or does not exist."" That's why people should not use ""agnostic"" to describe their lack of belief in God.",1,0,1443898801,1444719955

Respectfully, why is the burden of proof on those to disprove the existence of God? It is impossible to prove a negative. For instance, Russell's teapot--it's impossible to disprove that a teapot is indeed orbiting Earth. Shouldn't the burden of proof be on those that make claims--i.e. those that claim God exists?

As an atheist, I don't claim God does *not* exist. (And anyone that makes that claim is just stupid). I just haven't seen any convincing evidence that God does. I place the burden of proof on those that make claims.",1,0,1443895461,1444719955

Let me ask you this to drive the point home: If India had the same number of guns, or the same access to guns, as America, would you expect the same or similar rate of mass shootings? Same question for the UK? Germany?

I would wager that even if you had the same number of guns, or more, in these countries, you wouldn't see the same rate of mass shootings. America is culturally different when it comes to guns. They have an implacable love for guns. Even if you were to reduce the number of guns, and restrict gun access, it won't have much of an effect on American mass shootings. It's the culture that needs to change. ",3,0,1443892760,1444719955
cvmviav,0,t1_cvmt7ot,bigger_than_jesus,"> I think we could work on all three, frankly. It is easy to get painted as someone who thinks the only solution is gun restriction, which isn't my position.

True, we should work on all three. But you stated that it was ""shortsighted"" to think the mental health component was a ""primary driver"" behind these mass shootings. You do call for mental health to be part of the solution too. So I guess I don't understand the point you were making by your post. Are you saying  that mental health is not a significant factor?

I think you missed my point in comparing to India. You seemed to argue that all things being equal (i.e. mental illness affects other populations at the same rate as in the U.S.), gun access is the culprit behind these mass shootings. I disagree, and cited India as an example of a country with numerous guns.

So if mental illness affects India and the U.S. the same, and both countries have numerous guns, then it seems this type of violence turns on culture. That's my argument.",5,0,1443891638,1444719955

cvmr914,1,t3_3nc2e5,bigger_than_jesus,"> It just seems shortsighted to think that this is the primary driver of a problem that seems to fall solely within the borders of the US.

Why is that shortsighted? Mass shootings result from the brew of mental illness, access to guns, and American culture. ""The country with the next-highest number of guns is India, with 46 million guns spread across a much larger population of more than 1.25 billion"" [says CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/27/health/u-s-most-mass-shootings/). And they're not in the top 5 countries with mas shootings. So what makes them different? Culture.

America has a unique gun culture, and the 2nd Amendment, both of which makes it nearly impossible to restrict access to guns. It's incredibly difficult to change an amendment, and even more so to change culture. So of the three factors--mental illness, access to guns, and American culture--which area can we immediately work to improve to make a difference? Is that really ""shortsighted""?",11,0,1443883619,1444719955
