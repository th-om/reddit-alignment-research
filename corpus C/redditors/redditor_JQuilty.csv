cvw7uvt,0,t1_cvvxhtl,JQuilty,"Samsung the fabrication company is run by different people than Samsung the phone company. There's only four real fabs for this type of stuff -- Intel, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), and GlobalFoundries (GloFo). Intel doesn't open their fabs to outsiders except in rare instances like some ASIC manufacturing that isn't in competition with them, which allows them to take advantage of something that doesn't need high yields to sort out their process. TSMC, GloFo, and Samsung will fab chips for whoever can pony up the money. So this means AMD, nVidia, Apple, Qualcomm, etc. If Samsung the fab company were found to be making bad chips on purpose, they'd ruin their reputation, and it'd be so absurdly expensive to ruin the chips to begin with without spoiling the entire process for other customers.",5,0,1444598264,1444723830
