cvxu0vp,0,t1_cvxtvib,KingdomofNorthKorea,"I mean Columbus was the physical manifestation of the age of discovery. Even if he was a dick in some ways he is more of a symbol than he is a person, like santa claus or paul bunyan. He is the age of discovery personified over time.",0,0,1444711355,1444722063
cvxty7s,0,t1_cvxsucb,KingdomofNorthKorea,"I think this way of thinkng sort of feeds into ""dont see the forest because of the trees"" people these days are so individualistic that they are allways trying to find every nitty gritty detail behind things and ""expose"" this or that subtle innacuracy. History is more a guage of the general feeling of the times and ideas and movements than it is what bob had for breakfast habitually each day.

I am not saying the latter isnt important to an extent but I think people lose the meaning in the details allot of the time.",2,0,1444711193,1444722063

cvxs6ci,0,t1_cvxpwj6,KingdomofNorthKorea,"I am not envoking a slippery slope. We have been editing, rewriting and abandoning our history systematicalky since the seventies. I sm simply taking the idea of celebrating only current cultual norms to its logical conclusion.",0,0,1444707677,1444722063
cvxs3yg,0,t1_cvxpyrh,KingdomofNorthKorea,"Well, Im not refering to north America. The Americas are a seperate civilisation from europen civilisation, think monroe doctrine. Also columbus landed on Hispaniola, which is most definitely part of north America.",0,0,1444707563,1444722063

cvxp816,0,t1_cvxoebi,KingdomofNorthKorea,Twenty years ago I was taught that Columbus was kinda a dick. But whether you like it or not he is onr of the forefathers of our civilisation. Columbus day is about the beginning of American civilisation more than it is specifically about columbus.,-2,0,1444702861,1444722063
cvxp4i3,0,t1_cvxo1a8,KingdomofNorthKorea,Why do we need to start on anything? I didnt know  there was a system of oppression being perpetrated against indians these days. If anything I would say that isolating them on reservations outside of state jurisdictions does more to harm the American Indian than any other action by our society.,-9,0,1444702711,1444722063
