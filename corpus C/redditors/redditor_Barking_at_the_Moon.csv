> In Chicago, which has the country's second biggest fleet with roughly 7,000 taxis, the median sale price for a medallion hovered around $70,000 in 2007 before reaching a median sales peak of $357,000 in late 2013.

> Since reaching that high point more than a year ago, the value of medallions in the Windy City have sharply declined and sales have ground to a near halt—with the city recording only seven medallion transfers in the first quarter of 2015—as the median sale price fell to about $270,000.

Both Democratically controlled urban...oases? Thank you for reinforcing my point. Still, compared to much of Chicago, Rockford, East St. Louis, etc. an argument can be made that they *are*, at least so far as gun crime goes... Again, the salient point is that gun control has proven that it isn't effective and real-world limitations mean that ""get the guns"" is never going to happen in a workable manner.

We seem to be pretty good at identifying them, the problem is more that we lack the will to address the problem before it explodes. Right now, [Cook County \(Chicago\) Jail](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/americas-largest-mental-hospital-is-a-jail/395012/) is the largest mental health facility in the nation. That's not a bad joke, it's a tragedy in it's own right. In terms of cost and effectiveness it simply isn't an intelligent approach. Worse, the reluctance to incarcerate violent mental patients stems at least in part from our strategy of  punishing them in jails instead of treating them in hospitals.

> Again, how do we identify these people?

I don't know, except to say that ""they"" seem to be most of us. I don't have a workable answer to the problem other than each of us needs to look inside and ask whether or not we could do the hard but right thing if it came down to one of our family members. Perhaps you have some suggestions? 

> Gun free zones don't work ~~when you can go across the street and buy a gun at Walmart~~. 

Fixed that for you. You're wandering back into the urban fantasyland where guns are going to be outlawed and confiscated and that's simply not going to happen - indeed, efforts to do so have failed and been declared illegal. It's time to make adjustments to accommodate reality.

> The media doesn't help but mass shootings isn't our only issue.

Nor did I say that is was - but it is part of the problem and it's time we start addressing *all* of the contributing factors. The media's need for ratings and propensity for pontificating propaganda have made the problem worse and it's time for them to stop - and for us to insist that they do.

> Wisconsin and Indiana have some of the most lax gun laws in the country and they are a stones throw from Chicago.

Yep, and the gun violence problem doesn't seem to be nearly as severe in either state as it is in Illinois. See, the same data, from a different perspective, can have radically different meaning. That's what I was talking about when I said that it's time for the anti-gun advocates to take a long hard look at their arguments and the mistakes *they* have been making before continuing to gnash their teeth and rail at the moon every time one of these mass killings happens.

cvp20ir,1,t3_3nkqmw,Barking_at_the_Moon,"Gun control is a fantasy fostered by urban liberals as a means of locking up tens of thousands of black men and other minorities who might otherwise threaten them and their social position. In other words, it's a time honored Democratic Party policy in the long and inglorious tradition of [Nathan Bedford Forrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Bedford_Forrest#Speaks_to_black_Southerners) and the [oppressive slave masters of the south](http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/10/us/guns-race/) where the uppity young men who resist the yoke are rounded up and locked up or lynched.

More importantly, gun prohibition as a means of control is also ridiculously ineffective. Aside from the fact that a handgun ban would require a Constitutional Amendment to be legal (speaking of fantasies) it has been tried - for generations in places like Chicago and DC - and dramatically failed to reduce gun crime. 

Guns, to the extent that they are a problem, are so because they are a force multiplier. That *is* important but it is only a small piece in the puzzle and focusing on the gun as the central element in violent crime is a disingenuous dereliction. There are any number of other issues relevant to ""gun"" crime (including mass homicides like the one in Oregon or Sandy Hook or...) that are typically ignored because they would require the anti-gun supporters to (a) take a critical look at themselves and their positions, and (b) make some changes in themselves. Unfortunately, it's easier and more satisfying to make like monkeys at the zoo and start flinging poo at everyone you disagree with than to effectively address the problem. 

Also ignored in the 'discussion' is the fact that gun crime is dwarfed in this country by the benefits gun ownership offers. It's hard to tally the value of the reality that we wouldn't have been able to throw off the British yoke if they had been successful in their efforts to outlaw gun ownership in the colonies - the 'long carbine' carried by Hawthorne's Hawkeye didn't win the war for the US but it *was* instrumental in allowing us to start the resistance and fight long enough for other strategies to come to fruition. That's worth remembering in an age of ever more intrusive and demanding US Government, whether you're a libertarian anarchist, a dope smoking tax evader or simply someone who is terrified by the images coming from the cities of heavily armed combat units masquerading as police. The discussion also typically ignores the more immediate benefits of defensive gun use in the US. Studies of defensive gun use are highly political - in both directions - and vary widely but middle estimates indicate that [approximately a million times a year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_gun_use) a gun is used for personal self-defense.

But rather than talking past each other, as typically happens, what other factors influence criminal violence involving a gun that we can address without undue political dissension? Here's a short list, in no particular order:

* **Mental health care in this country is a bad joke.** It isn't as available as it should be, it focuses too much on enabling aberrant behavior instead of correcting pathology and it isn't effective at removing dangerous people from society. Some of these factors are beyond our control but mostly it's our lack of will, not a lack of ability, that allows the crazy violent people to roam free.
* **People are too reluctant to act.** In almost every single one of the mass killings, many people around the perpetrator understood that they were spiraling out of control and yet did little or nothing to intercede. It is incumbent upon each and every one of us to do something when we know something and yet all too often fear of interfering has led to a far worse tragedy. If it takes a village, the villagers need to be willing to take action to stop their crazy brother/uncle/neighbor before he blows a gasket.
* **Gun free zones are insane.** Really, if you're a supporter, how's that working out? Reports are that since 1950, all but *two* of the mass-killings involving guns happened in areas where guns are officially prohibited - and that includes the [school in Oregon](http://www.vocativ.com/news/236421/the-complications-of-oregons-guns-on-campus-laws/). This lunacy is a demonstration of how political posturing can be at direct odds with reality on the ground. Mutually assured destruction is scary but advertising your inability and unwillingness to defend yourself is a tactic that invites disaster.
* **The media isn't acting to inform, they're acting to entertain.** Southern California has a disproportionate number of car chases that are explained simply: grab a car, go for a wild ride and you're guaranteed your fifteen minutes of infamy. Somber pancake-slathered newsreaders breathlessly narrating videos from flocks of circling helicopters isn't about providing the news to viewers, it's about dramatic programming that's cheaper than producing a soap opera. Ditto shootings, fires, and pretty much everything else in the news - television or print. As with the recent Oregon shooting, the media is intentionally and maliciously provoking and providing these nightmares to entertain you so they can sell advertising, not to educate and inform you. When entertainment and political perspective become more important than taking the time and effort to gather and analyze the information before publishing it, the media has become a part of the problem instead of the solution.
* **Gun control efforts in the US have failed, miserably.** I live in Chicago which, until recently, was one of the most gun-restrictive communities in the country. For *generations* it has been basically impossible to legally own a gun and yet the gun problem hasn't gotten better, it's gotten worse. I get it that gun control doesn't work if the bad guys have access to guns from outside the community but the most important part of that statement is that gun control doesn't work. The right-wing crazies turned out to be right when they said that making it criminal to own a gun would mean that only criminals owned guns - that is precisely what has happened. At this point it is clear that the strategies employed by the anti-gun folks have made the problem worse, not better, and you have to be learning impaired not to recognize that a change in approach if not attitude is required. Doubling down on dumb isn't a policy, it's a fallacy.

Perhaps it's time for all of us to tackle the problem as a violence problem and not as a gun problem. We might surprise ourselves and see that the gun part of the problem takes care of itself.
