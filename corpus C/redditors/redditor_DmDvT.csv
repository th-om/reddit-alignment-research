ctyfqm1,0,t1_cty3agw,DmDvT,"Pain, active infection, permanent teeth get cavities as they come in. In a few cases have resulted in death. For example as the first molars come in with decay on them, eventually those get filled and are weakened by age 6. Your basic adult teeth foundation is compromised immediately as they erupt. Leaving active decay in a child is negligent and setting them up for major dental work or future dentures in their adult life.",2,0,1439242913,1444722047
ctyb3qq,0,t1_cty9ze9,DmDvT,"I am a dentist. Sounds like dentist couldn't isolate the tooth. Thats why we use that rubber dam when doing composite fillings. Isolation is key to the success. Unfortunately, I hate seeing these news articles because I see so many patients that go to other ""cheaper"" countries and come back for maintenance. Usually the materials used are cheap, and results in much more pain, discomfort and cost to the patient long term. Dental issues do not happen over night, usually these foreign clinics treatment fails in a few years, its no big deal to them they will stick implants anywhere nerves be damned. They dont care because they do not see the patient again and do not deal with the infections, failures, and post operative problems. It is really a bummer when patients have to have their teeth and implants extracted they thought they were getting a great deal on. Or a graft gets infected because they used who knows what grafting bone. I have seen some unbelievable stuff. That being said there are some foreign countries that do dental work to the standard of care we have in the states. Canada comes to mind.",4,0,1439235812,1444722047
