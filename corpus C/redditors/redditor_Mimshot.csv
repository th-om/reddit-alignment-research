I'm not sure if you're agreeing or disagreeing with me here.  I said ""distribution"" lines not ""transmission"" lines, although if you don't know the difference I'm not sure why you're acting authoritative on this topic. Typically neither has insulation when overhead.  That sign is likely way to short to have hit a transmission line though.",1,0,1444618810,1444719277

One is through the electric shock causing ventricular fibrillation, which requires a minimum of somewhere around 30mA (not very much).  The other is through burns, when the electricity literally cooks you.  Heat is produced by current passing through the human body and the heat produced is proportional to the energy dissipated: voltage * current * time. ",2,0,1444618237,1444719277

If you believe this then you're talking out of your ass as well.  The current matters, the voltage matters, the time of exposure matters.  Overhead distribution lines are not insulated, so if you're touching a sign that touches them you can quite easily be electrocuted.  I would ask why you think there might be an un-insulated ""residential wire"" suspended over the road, but you're clearly talking out your ass.",1,0,1444617924,1444719277
