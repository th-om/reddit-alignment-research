It may have been an honest question but it was certainly loaded with a ton of implied negatives.  Here check these links out:

It's important to remember the United States is losing its democracy, recent measurements have declared it an [Oligarchy](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746).  That means that the businesses have control of the government and make decision based on them making more money.  The US government no longer has human rights nor the success of the country as priority 1.  One of the biggest examples of this corruption is the copyright/patent laws.  This is why these questions of yours are getting so much backlash, people are pissed off at the stupid broken laws, the ones you are pointing out and acting like a saint about, ""well jeez guys why is it wrong to have consequences for breaking the law"".  

Imagine paying $18 to see a movie, you enjoyed it so you wait a month, fuck that was a good movie I want my girl to watch it, so you pay another $18, x2, it's a good flick and you are an adult, you do what you want.  Another two months go by, the movie is released to HBO, shit, you don't have that and want to watch the movie again with your bro's, fuck it, HBO is only $10 a month, you sign up, besides think of all the other films you have access too.  It's been four months since the movie release and your birthday comes up, your mom who loves you and know your movie likes picks up the movie as a present, you are overjoyed, in your excitement you rip open the package and throw it in your DVD player but it says error...wtf!! looking at the case, thats odd, it says HD DVD, oh bummer wrong format and because you opened it the store won't take it back.  Tough luck mom, no worries accidents happen.  Meanwhile that $25 toaster you got as a re-gift from Uncle Johnny doesn't match your kitchen, staring it down you make the decision, fuck it, Im trading in the toaster to get my damn movie, lookout Walmart I don't even have a receipt.  Off to Walmart you go returning with your prize in hand.  Only a month goes by, its Christmas, tearing open your presents you see Mom has come through, a brand new PS3 is staring you down, BlueRay capable, hell yeah Hidef here I come.  Oh shit the DVD isn't 1080p, well fuck, off to walmart again.  Boy what a steal, $35 and I get the directors cut.  Putting in your movie you notice how the advertisements you can't fast forward through are current, thats odd, whatever, fast forward, wait its not working... no worries, I will get some popcorn and a beer.  Wow another great screening, that movie gets better everytime I watch, time to put it away.  While pulling the movie out of the ps3 your dog dashes across the room barking at something outside, fight or flight kicks in you spin taking a ninja stance, but your equilibrium is off you fall, the Bluray goes flying from your hand across the room.  At that very same instant Rowdy turns from the window, his eyes lock on, a single thought crosses his mind, FRISBEE, in a split second he is across the room.  You stare in horror as he leaps and snatches the disk out of the air with a loud crunch as it snaps in half.  In tears you call your lawyer,surely there is a way to get this replaced, solemnly your lawyer responds you have no options.  But, a thought crosses his mind, you could upgrade, buy the PS4, go buy the 4k version of the film, thats only $40, and it comes with a DVD copy!  What a pal, you book it over to walmart one more time, hey the PS4 rocks, and guess what, the 4k film has extended directors cuts and 3 pages of original art, thats $40 well spent.  

I hope nobody has done that for one movie, but think about how many movies the average person buys, how many times have you payed money for different formats of the same film?  How many DVD's, Blurays, movie tickets are sold in any given day/week?  Why is the system so broken?

cvxtjdu,0,t1_cvxr8if,morebeansplease,"> I suppose i should precede this with a disclaimer that I am Roman Catholic, but that the church I go to has never (at least when I'm there which isn't particularly often) addressed the matter in front of me and I am not well read in the scriptures so my faith hasnt really affected my views.

I dont know how to respond, you go to church on a regular basis but claim it doesn't affect your views, what sort of madness is this.  Could we discuss a dog who hears a bell ringing and is immediately fed a hundred times, yet this time the bell rings and there is no food, yet the dog stands their expectantly, salivating, physically prepared for food that doesn't come all the while claiming to not be affected.  Could you imagine a soldier returning from war, feeling constantly out of place and under threat, contemplating suicide and claiming not to have PTSD, nah the war didnt affect me.  Or perhaps a person who nearly drowns and now gets scared in the bath yet claims the experience did not affect them.  I am not a PHD, take this response with that in mind, your claim to not be affected is insane.

So you just made up your opinion, its not researched, there is no science, you just have an idea.  Most important, this idea was not provided by religion, you are certain none of it came from religion... 

Here is what I think you are trying to say: ""The fetus is a human being from the moment of conception; this means abortion is murder, which is immoral and should be illegal.""  Assuming that your opinion falls into line with this position lets sort out the details.

1. Why have you defined a zygote/embryo/fetus to be included in your definition of life/personhood?  Notably this is scientifically incorrect, why are you not using science?  Perhaps a good starting point would be to begin by providing a detailed description of this life or personhood you are using, please also justify avoiding the scientific usage.

2. We could play a fun game and accept that the zygote/embryo/fetus is a person and we could change the abortion process to just eject the zygote/embryo/fetus from the body and see if it survives on its own, as a person would.  This would make the act no longer murder.

3. Lastly, again playing the game where we accept that the zygote/embryo/fetus is a person, how do you define morality of murder?

If that is not true would you mind finding an argument and not just crafting a psuedo scientific paragraph personal opinions and half truths.  Seriously, this is a big deal, it affects peoples lives, real people.  Every responsible adult should have a meager understanding of the situation.. especially if you are going to talk about it like your view has value.

>>what the ""It"" in your question referred to?

The topic is about how some hetero men assign undignified feelings to being penetrated.  We discussed how sexual ignorance is likely to be the provoker of these thoughts.  Your comment confirmed the suspicion and got downvoted... I'm not sure why though, clearly there are people ignorant about sex that frequent these threads.  So the question is how to turn them from an annoyance to a positive, how can their existence be used to enhance your existence.  ",1,0,1444692455,1444721525
