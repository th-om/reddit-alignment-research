>
>* At hollywood levels, shooting on film is no more expensive than shooting on digital, it's basically budget noise, so why not?

1. That cost is still felt for productions, especially lower-budget independent productions who might rather spend those few thousand dollars on better music, a nice location scout, or paying more money to the low-level workers on the production.

2. Financial costs aren't the only cost of using film. There are space/time/opportunity costs involved. Examples 1) When shooting with film, you have to be cautious of how much film you use. You cannot shoot indefinitely, as every moment on film is literally wasted money with a scarce commodity. When shooting digitally, directors can shoot indefinitely; if the actors start hitting a stride them the director can keep them at that level as long as he or she wants. With film, there is necessarily an upper limit to that. You *must* eventually change reels, and that process will almost always take longer than changing hard drives. Not only do you have to cut when every take is over so you don't waste film, but everybody on set contributes  distractions during the cuts: makeup artists rush in to make sure the actors are still fine, actors will insist on getting a drink of water, everyone wants to talk about how that take went. That time can slow things down if a director wants to move at a quicker pace. 2) Film takes up space. Like, a lot of space. Imagine a huge production like the LotR trilogy. All of the film they shot had to be stored somewhere between filming it, and using it in the editing room. Additionally, there are considerable time costs to editing with film vs editing digitally. 3) With digital shoots, you can immediately see what you have just shot. That isn't the case with film...a director might think he nailed a scene only to find out later when reviewing the footage that the camera was out of focus for some reason. This can *potentially* cause expensive reshoots, necessitating the need to rebuild sets and call back actors and workers for pick up shots. 4) Film must be shipped around the country/world if it needs to be anywhere. Digital movies can be sent in drastically shorter time over the internet. This is great for bigger productions who might have a second unit filming hours or even days away, but still allow a director to keep tabs (relatively) instantly on what's going on. This also means that a movies deadline can be pushed later, as distributed don't need to worry about printing and mailing thousands of prints (itself another substantial cost)",1,0,1444721080,1444725078
cvxll8p,0,t1_cvxkw9r,mfranko88,"I remember reading an article within the past two years about the most intense baseball rivalries, and the author had the Cubs/Cards at third. He said something along the lines of ""as historic as the Yankees/Sox or the Dodgers/Giants, but wrapped around a pleasant Midwestern friendliness"".

The two teams haven't been good at the same time for a long time. Since 2000, the three years that the Cubs made the post season, the Cardinals were barely 500 teams (or worse). Younger baseball fans out of the area have this weird idea that Cubs and Cards fans are chummy.

Fuck that noise.",2,0,1444697256,1444725078
cvxkqiy,0,t1_cvxdk51,mfranko88,"I said this elsewhere on /r/baseball, but it bears repeating.

The ""fuck the cardinals"" mentality from everyone is a little tiring. I get why it's there but it still sucks, and I wish the atmosphere didn't feel so hostile to cardinals fans who just want to talk about baseball. That said, I would be extremely disappointed to hear anything else from Cubs fans. All this Cubsbro/Cardsbro chummy nonsense is stupid. It's in the franchise DNA of both teams.

No.

The sentiment is a little tiring from other fans though. I get it; being good over multiple years paints a target on our back. But it sucks that the hostility is everywhere. It really clamps down on some good conversation and analysis when Cards fans feel anxious about just opening their mouths.",16,0,1444492963,1444725078
