cvx31im,1,t3_3og9zb,Aumah,"They undoubtedly helped them last time. The GOP lives and dies on the narrative that government is intrinsically bad; that government can't help solve any problems. They've calculated that more people will respond to the dysfunction by giving up on politics altogether than will respond by getting angry and going to the polls to punish those responsible. And so far that bet's been paying off: last election had the lowest turnout in **70 years**, and the GOP won its biggest congressional majority in **80 years**.

Even worse: what drives decent people away from politics is exactly what motivates the GOP base the most. Notice all the anti-establishment, zero-experience candidates leading their presidential race? The GOP's base doesn't want politicians - they want jihadists. If they can't control the government they want to burn it down.",7,0,1444669404,1444718082

cvu6znk,0,t1_cvu21sc,Aumah,"The other big part of this IMO is the two-party system itself. The relative moderates could have almost any Speaker they wanted if they broke ranks by bringing in the Dems. Of course that would break dramatically with the tradition of the Speaker being elected single-party. What exactly would happen as a result is hard to fathom. A move like that has as much or more potential to be destabilizing as restabilizing, consequently very few think it will happen. An Amercan general was once asked when he thought the Iraq insurgency would end. He replied ""when they realize they have lost."" Suffice to say the Tea party/Freedom caucus types don't feel like they have lost or are even close to it. More of the same is the likely course for at least the next few years, unfortunately. Ultimately the battle between the conservative factions remains just a subplot. The main story is still the war between the two parties.",1,0,1444427660,1444718082
cvu1xc1,1,t3_3o4ekw,Aumah,"One part of it is pretty straightforward, and exemplified by the ""Freedom"" caucus: fervent anti-authoritarianism and strong leadership aren't compatible... at least as long as your definition of strong leadership isn't “unyieldingly fighting for my side's principles exclusively.” As ideological orthodoxy's stock rises, leadership's stock inevitably falls. That is after all the essence of anti-authoritarianism: not wanting to be told what to do. Resistance is the prevailing ethos of modern conservatism. You can have statesmen or you can have fighters, and the right increasingly chooses fighters.",1,0,1444419678,1444718082

cvtgnpu,1,t3_3o15kd,Aumah,"First, a disclaimer: I think it's a waste of time trying to ask Ben Carson any questions about politics because he has an extremely low level of political sophistication - not just for a presidential candidate, but for a political office holder at almost any level. Carson is considered by many to be one of the most ridiculous figures in all of politics. Your time would be infinitely better served by subscribing to a year of Time or watching some well-regarded political documentaries.

But if you go, I'd ask him: Republicans routinely argue that Democrats engage in the politics of division: that Democrats have come to dominate among minorities by instilling in them a sense of victimhood, and by promising to make up for this alleged injustice by giving them handouts. If this is in fact the Democrats' strategy, why are minorities -- all minorities, even the more affluent -- so susceptible to it? Why aren't conservative whites, even the less educated, as easy to fool as all minorities are? Why aren't conservative whites, even the less affluent, as greedy as minorities? Why aren't they as lazy as minorities - especially blacks?",2,0,1444373360,1444718082
cvtff0v,1,t3_3o038b,Aumah,"I think your sense that ""this is different"" is correct, but I think what's going on is even bigger than that. IMO we're transitioning not to a new party era but to a new epoch in which the two-party dynamic no longer predominates. This is actually the political subject I am most curious about: when and how the two party epoch/era ends. Could be wrong of course, but that's my takeaway from all the weirdness of this extremely long, and now extremely dysfunctional, 5/6th era. ",1,0,1444369500,1444718082
