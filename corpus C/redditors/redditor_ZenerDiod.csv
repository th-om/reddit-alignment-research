You should tell the CBO and every economist they're wrong. Perhaps you'll win a Nobel for telling them what you know that they don't.

>The cost to the consumer is almost 100% determined by what the consumer is willing to pay, not how much it cost the company to make it.

""Willing to pay"" means nothing in itself. Willingness to pay for a good is based of how badly they need the good and if there is a substuable good.

>As long as there is competition in the marketplace, you can increase corporate taxes a good bit before the consumers are harmed at all.

That's not how it works. Corporations need to attract investors to grow, they can't grow without profits to show the shareholders so they'll rise prices or cut wages and to offset some of the cost.",1,1,1444704114,1444716562

> The infrastructure spending is an expedient to get people to work. 

No, the point of an infrastructure spending program, or any program for that example is to make an investment in that will help the  economy grow. Jobs are a means to end. If you want jobs for the sake of jobs, pay people to dig ditchs with spoons.

>Second, the middle class is dying. It's shrinking and real household income is going down for the average American.

No it hasn't. The reason you think it has is that..

1) You're using an extremely flawed method of measuring inflation
2) Households have gotten smaller, so of course household incomes will go down, but that doesn't mean people are living poorer quality lives because that money is spread over more people.
3)You're not accounting for government transfers in the form of social programs, and you're not accounting for healthcare plans.
