cvxdgo5,0,t1_cvxc0ip,MemeticParadigm,">My gay experience means I don't need straight people to tell me that Clinton can't be trusted on gay rights.

Who said she can't be trusted on gay rights? Unless the country pulls a 180 out of fucking nowhere, support for gay rights will continue to be politically expedient. Are you implying that being gay imbues you with the ability to read Hillary Clinton's mind and ascertain that the *reason* she switched her stance was *not* political expediency? Or do you just not understand that the question is not about how gay people should feel about HC, it's about whether or not HC will do *whatever* is politically expedient?

>Sorry, my opinion is still more legitimate, more important, more relevant, etc.

Sorry, it's not, because the question is about HC's motivations, not about how the gay community *feels* about HC's motivations so again, unless being gay gives you the ability to read her mind, your opinion on the matter counts the same as the opinions of individuals of every sexual orientation.

Furthermore, it's funny to me that you feel comfortable presenting your opinions as though your being gay makes them representative of the opinions of all or most gay people in the US, as though you find it *desirable* that people should take the actions or opinions of one gay person as being representative of all or most gay people. In the circles I run in, most of the people impacted by issues of marriage equality are not nearly so forgiving of how late in the game Clinton's stance ""evolved"".

>Also, it's pretty explicit in this argument that they're saying gay people should feel negatively towards her!

Nope, that was never stated explicitly, and I challenge you to quote /u/kindcannabal saying that *explicitly*. Since in all likelihood you can't, you're also welcome to quote where you believe that was stated *implicitly*, and I'll gladly disabuse you of the notion.",2,0,1444684366,1444717640

The entire story of Bernie's polling numbers thus far have been that his support tends to track pretty strongly with the proportion of people that are familiar with him vs familiar with Clinton - and Clinton's had incumbent-level name recognition from the word go.

I'll be very interested to see the polls this month. If the first debate doesn't have much of an impact, it seems unlikely that subsequent debates will - but I can *definitely* see this election being far enough outside multiple norms that tomorrow winds up being one of those debates that significantly impacts the outcome.",1,0,1444683070,1444717640

No, it doesn't. Being a ""Certified Gay"" makes your *lived experience* incontrovertible, nothing more, nothing less. How *you feel* about the timing and context of Clinton switching stances is **100% irrelevant** to the question of whether or not her switch is simply an indicator that she will do whatever is most politically expedient.

Now, if somebody said, ""Gay people should feel negatively towards Clinton because yadda, yadda,"" then your personal identity would be *highly* relevant - but that's not what's being argued.

What's being argued is simply, ""Hillary Clinton's stances are far more indicative of someone who takes the path of least resistance politically, than they are of someone who's willing to stand up for what they believe in the face of opposition,"" which is an argument that your identity and/or feelings have zero bearing on.",0,0,1444681093,1444717640

Well, they are unbiased, but bias is kind of an integral part of good representation - representatives should act in a way that is biased in favor of the ""communities of interest"" that they are representing. By allowing communities to be split down the middle all over the place, you dilute that bias and wind up with each Rep being more likely to only be biased in favor of the state in general, which is already what Senators do.

I think it's important that we note that ""bias"" isn't always a dirty word - really, representation should be subject to fairly strong bias in favor of the people being represented, and breaking up groups with common interests negatively impacts how well that can happen.",3,0,1444678331,1444717640
cvwyk74,0,t1_cvuge4t,MemeticParadigm,">You can print all the money you want. Money represents real goods.

Incorrect, but close. Money is an *imperfect proxy* for the *estimated value* of real goods/services. The two are coupled, but with a significant degree of elasticity.

>All growth comes from savings. It doesn't matter if demand is high if there is no savings for investment.

If you stopped to think for two seconds, you'd realize that the reverse is just as true:

>All growth comes from demand. It doesn't matter if there is saved capital available for investment if there is no demand for new goods to be produced by said investment.

You are simply falling victim to the single cause fallacy.

>Printing money doesn't make these good appear out of nothing.

Neither does saving money - none of the saved capital will be invested in the means of production if there is no demand for production.

This is simply not true for an entity capable of producing fiat currency.

>He doesn't understand that growth comes from savings, not spending.

Growth comes from an increase in total value, which results from increasing the rate at which value is produced. The rate at which new value is produced is limited by the maximum rate at which the means of production can produce goods/new value, and mediated by the demand for said goods.

Saving doesn't increase the demand for goods, it provides the opportunity to increase the maximum rate at which the means of production can produce goods, by investing the saved money in new/improved means of production. Spending, OTOH, increases the demand for goods.

Thus, the question of whether you ultimately see more growth from $1 of spending, or $1 of saving/investment, will always depend on the balance between the current demand, and the current means to satisfy that demand.

Sanders doesn't believe growth only *ever* comes from spending, he believes that the current balance between demand and means of satisfying that demand is such that $1 of spending will produce significantly more growth than $1 of saving.",4,0,1444414043,1444717640

Why do you think responsibility has anything to do with it? The state doesn't give a fuck what you are *morally* responsible for, the state holds a gun to your head and tells you that you are going to pay for what they say you are going to pay for.

The question is not, ""which of these situations are you responsible for,"" because, obviously, you are 100% correct - you are responsible for neither.

The question, at least until you can wrest the metaphorical gun from the hands of the state, is gun to your head (in multiple senses), given 2 options of what to pay for, which one is your *preference*?
