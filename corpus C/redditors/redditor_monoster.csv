If people don't go to their GPs, they'll end up in the A&E, push 111 and pharmacists to do what? Walk in centers are in use but aren't open 24 hours.

>Preventative medicine and self care for long term conditions. The way diabetics are treated with a nurse seeing them once a month or so and them controlling their own care is going to be pushed for a lot more diseases. This links into telehealth where someone takes their blood pressure, weight, or whatever else with nhs devices themselves at home and emails it to the nhs. All this is added to their patient record and if their is a spike or change a nurse or doctor gives them a call before it's a problem. 

The diseases it can be pushed for, it has already been pushed for. Telemedicine has its benefits and risks and healthcare workers prefer actually meeting their patients.

>Close hospitals, seriously many many hospitals aren't needed now they should be more specialized, Gps or walk in centers should do minor surgeries Xrays or other radiology, infections plaster up bones and all the sort of day in day out grunt work most hospitals do. Other hospitals should be turned into elderly rest-bite care or only be for 9-5 appointments. (obviously no one is ever going to say this on the news) 

You don't seem to have an idea the sorts of specialization necessary for minor surgeries, radiology and fracture management. You want GPs doing minor surgeries? Are they trained surgeons? If it gets botched what happens? GPs already have long appointment times and you want to add the stress of ""minor surgeries"" to it? Surgeries that'll need complementary staff and what not.

>It sums up to getting people who feel unwell to go to the cheapest (and quickest/least invasive) part of the NHS first help as many as you can then move them up to the more expensive parts. For people who are already ill, pass on a lot of the responsibility of their care to them and make it fool proof and safe for them to do it.

I don't know how often you work with people but people have a spectacular track record of screwing things up and blaming the system.",0,0,1444478210,1444727288
cvup2kp,0,t1_cvtldrj,monoster,">Funding requirements for the NHS have risen faster than economic growth pretty consistently since 1948, the structure of PFI contracts, an ageing population and the lack of competition (yes, I'm serious, competition improves management) are all likely more important.

How exactly can competition be generated when it comes to healthcare? Unless you're thinking of making healthcare workers decide to provide less care than they think a patient will need, then there's simply no way for competition to work.",1,0,1444477421,1444727288

This is my other pet peeve in regards to nukes, why would you target a city with your expensive, nuclear tipped ICBM when there are plenty of valid military targets? Because the USA did it to Japan?

Lots of military bases are near cities, you don't know where the silos are and the citizens of those cities should have pressured their leaders not to launch the nuclear strikes.",1,0,1443716395,1444727288

cvk8y68,0,t1_cvjmymw,monoster,">Regarding deterrence, as Corbyn himself mentioned lots of countries don't have that deterrence and feel no need to get it. Partly because they're freeloading on the implicit guarantee that any country using a nuke on them will get retaliated against by the other nuke-users, yes, but that's still a reasonable position even if the UK loses its nuclear submarine fleet.

People and countries have been known to renege on agreements. It is entirely possible that countries with nukes won't use them unless they were directly attacked.",2,0,1443680035,1444727288

It's fine, whichever side ends up winning that argument and getting their way. What bugs me is seeing that argument characterised as ""free speech"" (eg, the good guys) vs ""censorship"" (the baddies). Both sides are just making use of their own right to speak freely to argue for a usage of a platform that they care about.

I think it is a free speech issue because those who wish to stop her from speaking are trying to do that as preliminary representatives of the government. The power distribution isn't equal and the platform is a public platform.",1,0,1443507467,1444727288
