My favorite incident happened when mom and dad weren't supervising junior at a white-tablecloth steakhouse.  He dashed in front of one of my coworkers who was carrying a tray with nine plates on it.  Rather than drop almost $300 worth of piping hot food on junior, my coworker jabbed the little SOB in the head with his knee.  The kid went flying, mom flipped out, hilarity ensued.

If you can't manage your kid, please get a sitter or stay home.  The world isn't a laboratory for your parenting.",65,0,1444602259,1444721609

A friend of mine owned two chop suey restaurants and his family does very well.  I guess they view it as ""do what I can to succeed so my kids won't have to put up with this"".",5,0,1444579194,1444721609
