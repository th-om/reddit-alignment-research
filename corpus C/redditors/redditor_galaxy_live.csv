cvsf31s,0,t1_cvsehp4,galaxy_live,"> That being said, Russia Today is Russian government propaganda.

True. In that sense RT is just like the BBC, CBC, PBS/NPR, Voice of America and other government-funded mass media outlets. That fact, however, does not make their stories false.

But I have to give RT credit. They openly and candidly admit that they report news ""from the Russian perspective."" They even go so far as to show clips of US Secretary of State John Kerry saying that RT is a ""propaganda bullhorn."" That admission of bias is certainly more honest and forthright than the BBC or PBS.

cvsccsh,0,t1_cvrz4ip,galaxy_live,"Good point. When chemical weapons were banned following WWI it was an expensive weapon that did not discriminate in causing casualties. (Though in reality, the number of casualties caused by chemical weapons in WWI were trivial compared to explosives or bullets; chemical weapons are not really WMD.)

At the time, some politicians in rich countries wanted them to be legal. For example, in 1920 Winston Churchill said, ""I do not understand this sqeamishness about the use of gas. I am strongly in favour of using poison gas against uncivilised tribes."" and wanted to use chemical warfare against poor natives in Britain's colonial rebellions.

Overall, chemical weapons today are viewed as a poor country's weapon. Instances of chemical weapon use by rich countries (e.g. white phosphorous, CS or Agent Orange) are simply ignored.

Chemical weapons use would make war waged by rich countries more problematic. So countries that could not afford to develop nuclear weapons (the ultimate protection against war by rich countries) and instead developed chemical weapons were demonized as barbarians, and the rich countries argue that chemical weapons would kill civilians as if aircraft bombs or artillery or assault rifles somehow do not.",1,0,1444301647,1444727520
cvrz9na,0,t1_cvryqcw,galaxy_live,"The US wants 2 things from foreign governments: Obedience to Washington's orders and subservience on all major geo-political issues, and for the country to open themselves up and to allow US and western corporations free reign inside their country.

Both Libya and Syria did not do that.

Only a decade ago the US was shipping ""terrorists"" (such as the innocent Canadian Maher Arar) to Syria to be tortured by Assad's government. That's a pretty close relationship, right? But it didn't matter -- Syria failed on the above 2 major demands of the US. Even though Libya got rid of its WMD programs (to big US fanfare) Gadaffi did not completely fulfill the above two conditions -- so the US and NATO attacked and killed him.

Look at all the countries on the US ""enemies"" list and you'll see they fail one or both of those 2 conditions.

But meanwhile back in reality, this suit has about as much chance of winning as do Native Americans suing the US government for violating its treaties, or Hawaiians trying to use the courts to un-do the illegal US overthrow of the Hawaiian government, or of torture victims trying to get justice in US courts.

US courts very, very rarely rule against the US government in such big matters. Instead, some reason is invented/used to throw the case out of court.

cvrozfd,1,t3_3nutqd,galaxy_live,"I would argue the dot-com bubble bursting is not analogous to the other 2. The dot-com bubble popping was just a routine cyclical recession.

The S&L scandal (at that point the largest US financial scandal) required a taxpayer/US government bailout. As such, it was a dramatic failure of both capitalism and the government's ability to reign in capitalism.

The 2008/9 crash, again, was a dramatic failure of capitalism and the government's ability to reign in capitalism and also required a taxpayer/US government bailout.

Love him or hate him, George Bush was 100% correct when he said that without a government bailout (and all the other less-publicized shenanigans) that the entire US (and by extension, world) financial system would collapse.

Let's face reality: Boom and bust are simply systemically inherent to capitalism. It's been that way since Karl Marx first documented the boom and bust business cycle in the second half of the 19th century.

The reason for these failures? Reagan started tearing down the restrictions on capitalism -- restrictions we learned the hard way via the Great Depression are *required* -- and simple corruption.

The 2008/9 disaster can be squarely placed at Bill Clinton's feet for repealing the Glass Steagall Act; the Reaganesque, far-right, laissez faire capitalist attitudes; the corporate takeover of both parties; along with the development of the unregulated derivatives market.

The saddest thing is that since 2008/9 Obama and the Democrats (the Republicans too, though no one expects them to do anything) have not done a damned thing to prevent the next disaster which could come at any time.
