cvo8es3,1,t3_3nga7e,UncleShagworthy,"I think the people that feel strongly against it are almost exclusively conservatives who have already made up their minds. For what it's worth I've seen #FeeltheBern used more by people complaining about it than by actual activists.

People like to hate on enthusiasm, and treat enthusiastic people like they are fundamentally unserious. But enthusiasm is valuable, and can drive the conversation. Enthusiasm is usually more influential than prosaic, reserved support.",16,0,1443994845,1444719066

cvnx93u,1,t3_3ng4o7,UncleShagworthy,"Your understanding of the Republican party is largely correct. The party base is *extremely* conservative right now, and very agitated. They live in a completely different fact world than you do. I honestly believe--if you could get a straight answer Republican from intellectuals and politicians--that they'd probably be much more moderate, but it's not possible for them to do that and win over their own party. A [majority of Republican voters](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_National_90115.pdf) believe the President is Muslim and less than a third believe he was born in the US, for example. This isn't some liberal lie, this is what polled republican voters say.

You're asking in a pretty conservative forum so you're going to get answers that blame your sources, or call you naive, or say you don't really understand. But for what it's worth, you're largely right to be skeptical of today's GOP.",1,0,1443978180,1444719066

cvgdtb8,1,t3_3mmpj5,UncleShagworthy,"Season 5 of Game of Thrones. A lot of plot development seemed less... sophisticated? realistic? natural? than previous seasons. It felt like there were a lot of plot devices and outcomes that existed more to get from Big Moment A to Big Moment B, rather than because they made sense or fit the world.",86,0,1443400618,1444719066
cvezqvj,1,t3_3mhd9v,UncleShagworthy,"Harping on Martin's writing style, especially word choice. Nipples on a breastplate happened like 6 times in 5 massive books. Maid of three and ten was said like 11 times, all during Brienne's search for... a maid of three and ten. Where do whores go? That happened about 9 times. This is all from [A Search of Ice and Fire](http://asearchoficeandfire.com/).

Honestly I never even noticed some of these until this sub, and even in subsequent rereads they never bothered me. I just don't feel like Martin is overrelying on these things.",11,0,1443290943,1444719066
