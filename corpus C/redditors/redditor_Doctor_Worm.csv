BUT:

1) OP asked specifically about people who want ""scientists *or engineers*,"" implying that the opinions in question do not discriminate between scientists and practitioners. 

2) Even if we did care about the distinction, Carson himself is *both* a doctor and a scientist. As in, [he has conducted and published scientific research in peer-reviewed scholarly journals](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Carson%20BS[Author]&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=1612580). He is a scientist, just not one who seems to espouse pro-science policies.",1,1,1444702894,1444719833
cvx74um,1,t3_3ohdmd,Doctor_Worm,"First, ""Reddit"" is not a monolithic entity with a single coherent belief system. There are millions of different Redditors who all have their own opinions and priorities, so it is unrealistic to expect that what makes the front page one day has to agree with what makes the front page the next day. 

But regarding the opinions you're referring to, I don't think people wanted a scientist just for the sake of having a scientist. They wanted a person who will support policies informed by the preponderance of scientific evidence and that will promote an expansion of further scientific research efforts ... and they assumed that someone with a scientific background would be likely to do those things. So when you point to a surgeon who denies the scientific consensus on things like climate change and evolution, and says he wants to cut government funding across-the-board (which would presumably include NASA, the NSF, etc.), he's not at all meeting the requirements of what those people were actually hoping for. 

You might as well ask, ""Conservatives always want a Christian to run for president. Well Obama is Christian, and all Conservatives do is bash him. Why?"" The answer is that even if Obama goes to a Christian church and personally identifies as a Christian and devoutly believes in the divinity of -- and salvation through -- Christ, his policies are not in line with what Conservatives consider ""pro-Christian"" political views. Conservatives don't want Christian leaders just for the sake of having Christian leaders, they want Christian leaders who will pass pro-Christian policies. If there's a Christian leader who opposes ""pro-Christian"" policies, Conservatives are likely to simply denigrate the leader's credibility as a ""true"" Christian (e.g., Obama is a secret Mooslum), in much the same way that liberals denigrate Carson's credibility as a ""true"" scientist.

TL;DR: You are misinterpreting ""wanting a scientist to run for president"" as an end in itself rather than a means to the end of science-based policymaking.",189,0,1444675344,1444719833
cvx5hix,1,t3_3oh3sy,Doctor_Worm,"They are certainly *more* popular among those who share the host's ideology, but ""only"" is much too strong. It's undeniable that partisan selective exposure exists -- there are people who will avoid it because it's too liberal, or tune in precisely because it's liberal enough for them. However, the fact that it aims for entertainment first means that it's at least more palatable to hostile audiences than a straight ""hard news"" format (e.g. Maddow) would. But where political comedy stands out most is its appeal to moderates, independents, and others who are normally disinterested in politics. By making the topics amusing and funny, they bring attention to topics that these people would otherwise not pay attention to at all. [Similar to how ""soft news"" like Oprah and Entertainment Tonight can help politically disinterested people learn about foreign policy by presenting it as a dramatic narrative.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwi7v-jNwb3IAhVFmYAKHYBrBrI&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstor.org%2Fstable%2F3117812&usg=AFQjCNF3uDMl8q5xpBDY0PIR3Sw4RmSgjA&sig2=pJlDvdbtcxkWy0lSqTaL8Q)

cvmpz4m,1,t3_3nc5cj,Doctor_Worm,"Liberals believe in a collectivist interpretation of the Second Amendment -- that is, the idea that the right to bear arms is something held collectively by a ""well regulated militia"" that is necessary for the achievement or security of a free state. That is basically how past courts interpreted the amendment prior to the Roberts court's ruling in DC v. Heller. That is different from an *individualistic* interpretation as established in Heller, which suggests that the right to bear arms is an individual right held by individual citizens. The big gun control debate is solely over this individualistic interpretation.

With respect to your question, OP, a liberal/collectivist interpretation of the Second Amendment would protect gun ownership of the sort that is most likely to actually bring about the outcome you're referring to (an armed and well-regulated militia), and would only restrict gun ownership of the sort that has little to no bearing on that scenario (one dude with a rifle).

cvmpmkm,0,t1_cvmobng,Doctor_Worm,"> Sure, but a hit in baseball is essentially a random (and very rare) event.

Uh, I know nothing about cricket, but this statement about baseball is just absolutely false. There are tons of things a baseball batter can do to control the placement of a hit. Any lack of ""control"" doesn't mean the outcome is random. It means the outcome is jointly determined by very deliberate strategic athletic maneuvers by highly-skilled players on both teams -- the pitcher's delivery, speed, placement, and ball movement; the batter's pitch selection, timing, and bat trajectory; and the fielders' positioning and defensive efforts all determine whether it's a hit or an out. 

Hits are rare? I suppose if about 25% of the time is ""very rare,"" then sure. Fair territory in an MLB stadium can be anywhere from 20,000 to 150,000 square feet (930 - 14,000 square meters) smaller than a cricket ground, and only cover 90 degrees from the batter's perspective. Meanwhile, lots of unique rules like walks, strikeouts, and ""fielder's choice"" artificially reduce the number of hits in ways that have nothing at all to do with randomness. 

It seems like everybody in these silly threads knows all the intricacies of their own sport and very little about the other, but still wants to argue that their sport is more complex or whatever. It's like Americans who argue that soccer/football is just jogging around kicking a ball without scoring, or people who argue that tennis is just whopping a ball back and forth. Every sport seems simple and easy if you only have a simplistic understanding of it. ",9,0,1443879565,1444719833
cvlw3ew,0,t1_cvlvunz,Doctor_Worm,"> Which is why they shouldn't limit legal carry otherwise.

Great, everybody pretty much agrees the status quo was unacceptable. But the more important question is which direction would be more effective and do the least harm -- tougher gun control, or looser gun control. The whole reason we have this crappy mish-mash Frankenstein of a gun policy is precisely because the country can't agree on the answer and usually refuses to discuss it rationally.
