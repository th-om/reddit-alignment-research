cvu1u10,0,t1_cvu1h1w,JordanLeDoux,"What I'm using it for is the server side of a game, but really there are many (niche) use cases for something like this. 

And while some other languages might be better for this application, that doesn't mean that they are better for the combination of application/developer/userbase. PHP is not inherently bad at these things, or slow at them either. It's just that the libraries don't exist for it.

Which is actually exactly why this should exist. :) 

I think a common use case for this could be converting shipping weights, although this library is way overkill for something like that. (Still, it won't be slow at something like that.)

Another use case that might come up in PHP is localization in general... being able to display a user's height/weight/etc., or the properties of an item, in any conversion that you want.

Your question has merit though. It was asked the last time I posted this too. The bottom line is this combination of details:

1. PHP is not especially bad at this *sort* of thing.
2. The libraries to do this sort of thing don't currently exist in PHP.
3. Ergo, the notion that this shouldn't be made because there are languages better at it is not a good argument, since the main advantage they have is that they have a library written already. Now PHP does too.

I'll wait and see what other people might do with this.",10,0,1444419539,1444722679
