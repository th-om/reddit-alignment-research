cvxsepz,0,t1_cvxsaus,Feurbach_sock,Haha that's awesome! I can kinda relate. She was complaining about her job and I tried real hard not to show I thought it was funny. ,1,0,1444708081,1444729180
cvxs4a9,0,t1_cvxrwm0,Feurbach_sock,I can see that lol I guess I'm just fascinated by it right now because it's different ,1,0,1444707578,1444729180
cvxm88h,0,t1_cvxhlh9,Feurbach_sock,It's true about the accent. Went on a date with a Russian girl a couple nights ago. It was very cute but reminded me of a movie russian.,2,0,1444698243,1444729180
cvtl8mw,0,t1_cvte9kv,Feurbach_sock,"I don't understand why you're being downvoted. The government specifically hires talented and experienced people to their bank regulatory agencies because they know the ins and outs of the industry. Their problem is hiring and retaining that talent, as well as keeping up to pace on the latest trends.

cv69c3j,1,t3_3lfusl,Feurbach_sock,It needs to be more like a Rock and Austin type situation. They both trade wins and get a legit rivalry going on. Then you'll have a little unpredictability in their wrestlemania fight. ,1,0,1442608150,1444729180

cv5y89e,0,t1_cv55b09,Feurbach_sock,I remember in Season 6 he gave that doctor guy a Kodak product from the closet. So I think even in season 6 they might have had it. I'm not sure though. ,2,0,1442591042,1444729180
