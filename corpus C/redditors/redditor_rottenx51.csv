If you'd like to say why the fusion of morality and psychology is incompatible, please argue for it, not just simply state it without supporting evidence. But beware: you will need to refute the studies that say there is a causation between for example criminality and childhood trauma. 

Now, just one more thing: Molyneux's UPB *does* qualify to all the items you listed. I have translated that book to my native language, so I have a pretty close and throughout relationship with it, and I can testify that it does.

cvwamyc,0,t1_cvwaal4,rottenx51,"I think we are talking of the same thing. Let me illustrate it instead then.
This is the example of what I argue you called ""good"" philosophy:

P1: All reptilians are based god beasts.

P2: Socratilluminati is a reptilian.

C: Socratilluminati is a based god beast.

> This is exactly where objectivism overextends itself by mixing incompatible fields, in this case philosophy and psychology.

I'm not so sure about that. Why do you think philosophy and psychology is incompatible? If someone's moral principles are something along the lines of he has to please others in every waking second of his life because that is his duty, and even accidentally deriving pleasure from his deeds is evil, and you would see that this person is literally mentally crushed and going crazy to the degree of physical symptoms, would you not safely pronounce the verdict that the person is being devoured by the morality that he holds? 

Nathaniel Branden was a psychologist, so I would trust his judgement in that regard. He also was the romantic partner of Ayn Rand, and spending that much time in her company, he understood her philosophy just as much as she did. (presumably)

cvw9b0a,0,t1_cvw8qs3,rottenx51,"Now let us examine this closer. You started it with:

> There seems to be some confusion about what constitutes a ""good"" and ""bad"" philosopher. Being wrong is not what constitutes a bad philosopher, as the vast majority of philosophical arguments and theories are unsound, but not necessarily invalid. 

Note that you yourself pronounced the good/bad dichotomy. Now, see that you say that ""the vast majority of philosophical arguments..."" in which you refer to arguments that are accepted and praised in the academy, arguments that ""good"" philosophers use. 

Following it you said that those are unsound, meaning that the premises are not true, but valid, meaning that the conclusions derived from the untrue premises are correct. 

I'm not sure about her arguments for atheism though. I have never read it in her works; there was an essay in the Virtue of Selfishness written by Nathaniel Branden called Mental Health versus Mysticism and Self-Sacrifice which I think is incredibely well-written, but its the fusion of objectivism and psychology.",1,0,1444600637,1444719407

But if a community that is able to provide food, clothing and shelter to itself wants to create cars for their members, that is the concrete example of misallocation of resources. You know Milton Friedman's I, Pencil? Now, it is basically incomprehensible how much steps it takes to create a car. If our comrades would deploy every willing and able - or rather just simply able human resource into producing a dozen car, they would deprive the community from the time and energy required to make food, tend to the fire, patch the tents and gather herbs or any other kinds of activities that are required for the sustinance of the anarcho-communist, post scarcity paradise.",2,0,1444599871,1444719407
