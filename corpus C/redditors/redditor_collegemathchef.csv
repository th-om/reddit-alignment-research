cvxu2lk,1,t3_3ojnb0,collegemathchef,"Mets are playing some great baseball. It's funny how Harvey looks mortal compared to DeGrom and Thor.  Alas, on to the next one.  I'm hoping Kersh will break his playoff funk right about...now?",4,0,1444711462,1444727361
cvxtumu,0,t1_cvxttgx,collegemathchef,Biggest start for Kershaw.  Legacy on the line.  He's going to do it,9,0,1444710978,1444727361
cvxtsgu,1,t3_3ojn9f,collegemathchef,"ALL we need is 2 true Greinke/Kershaw starts, and we're in the NLCS.  I realize Kershaw can only go 80-90 max tomorrow.  ",6,0,1444710849,1444727361
cvxtq2c,0,t1_cvxto8d,collegemathchef,True.  We should have went to Eddie Goeddel to draw a few more walks,-1,0,1444710706,1444727361
cvxtpio,1,t3_3ojnbk,collegemathchef,Also:  Fuck Carl Crawford.  I don't want to see Rollins or Craw in that goddamn lineup tomorrow.,5,0,1444710675,1444727361
cvxtozd,1,t3_3ojnbk,collegemathchef,We can do this.  This was just one of those games.  We can beat Matz tomorrow and Game 5s are just a different beast.  Greinke will be on normal rest...ANYTHING can happen.  The previous 4 games will be erased,2,0,1444710642,1444727361
cvxtiqm,0,t1_cvxthtw,collegemathchef,Definitely.  It's a joke scoring 7 and losing.  w t f,2,0,1444710278,1444727361
cvxthsv,1,t3_3oi4zr,collegemathchef,still could have won 7-6 after Anderson if Wood and company wouldn't have blown it,5,0,1444710227,1444727361
cvxrnie,1,t3_3oj8j1,collegemathchef,"LOL agreed.  It's so unfair how much of the burden they need to take on.  I do feel good about Game 4, and then Game 5 is ANYBODY'S guess.  ",4,0,1444706781,1444727361
cvxp3k9,1,t3_3oi4zr,collegemathchef,"This is disgusting.  I mean I didn't except Kershaw, but 7 runs?  This is a fucking joke",3,0,1444702671,1444727361
