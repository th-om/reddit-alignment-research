cvw0rjp,1,t3_3ocsfb,lightmonkey,"I am against Congressional term limits for a few reasons. The first is that I should be able to vote for whomever I want; if we like our representative than there should be no reason he can't continue to serve and if we don't like him than we can vote for someone else in the next election. It also is gives more power to lobbyists as they become the people with experience in drafting and pushing legislation. It also makes Congressman more likely to focus on their job after serving because there is a clear end date in mind, again amplifying the problem people want it to solve. 

A for stricter gun control, I don't see what that has to do with term limits at all. ",24,0,1444587528,1444721281

>No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.

It isn't spelled out, but I think the prevailing argument would be that The Speaker, while not a Congressman, is a member of the House and thus is any office that a member of the Executive Branch cannot hold.",1,0,1444256025,1444721281
cvrfyes,1,t3_3nura3,lightmonkey,It is a tricky subject because we can't know. The amount of people that get caught could be most of the people who commit voter fraud or be a small amount. All we can do is try to come up with a sensible system which prevents voter fraud as much as possible while still maintaining the rights of citizens. ,4,0,1444236781,1444721281
