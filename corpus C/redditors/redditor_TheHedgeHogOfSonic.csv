cvujt8j,0,t1_cvuiear,TheHedgeHogOfSonic,"Eh, depends on how you think of it. Would a loan by any other name smell as sweet?

Even by your own admission, you find it odd that we would just give money to another country with no strings attached. This is just one of many assurances that the US gains, attains, or maintains some measure of control in other countries.

As Carl Von Clausewitz said, ""war is merely an extension of diplomacy by other means."" Maybe the same can be true of foreign aid?",0,0,1444454468,1444723069

cvguo0n,1,t3_3mns53,TheHedgeHogOfSonic,"Yes, this still happens, but it depends on the race (State vs Federal) and the state laws that apply. There are some states where you can give to one candidate, but in no way indicate where (or to whom) that money should go. In the state I recently worked in, there is a large porn studio that wanted to donate to the Democrats, but having that on the filing report wouldn't look great, so they had the most liberal member in one of the safest districts take the donations.

The Presidential campaigns still do this as well, especially in early Caucus/Primary states, usually to help secure endorsements.

It's also interesting to note that in some states an individual can have as many PACs as you want, meaning if you're a donor and want to donate to State Representative Jones and you've reached the state limit for their campaign, donate to their 1,2,5, or 20 other PACs and you've found a legal way around the limits.",6,0,1443447872,1444723069
