Trial ring is the ring you wear to prepare yourself for your real ring, my reason being I wanted to be used to wearing a ring after the wedding so I wouldn't fuss with it sub-conciously in front of my wife and maybe worry her that I was uncomfortable with the ring, or worse, the marriage.  Totally unnecessary of course, but I'm still wearing it today, 6 years later. I don't care much about gold, or design, or inscriptions. If I see another ring in the future I really like maybe I'll buy it, in the meantime. Eh, 12 bucks.",1,0,1444335773,1444728054
cvoaf7g,0,t1_cvo8eki,RBMAN,"Totally agree with you, and am sorry to see the current state of big media in the United States. However, it's still very possible to start an independent media outlet, whether in print or radio in the United States. It never guarantees that it will be completely objective, in fact I don't believe COMPLETE objectivity, independence or truthfulness  actually exists in a free nation, or anywhere.
(sorry for yelling, just trying to emphasize.) Everybody has an agenda. Personally mine is biblical/or spiritual. Treat people the way you want to be treated. I still believe, that with all the warts and skeletons in the closet the United States has, true law and freedom exists here more than in Russia. My latest point in case is all about the gay marriage issue. The Supreme court ruled it's illegal to discriminate or prevent gays and lesbians from marrying and unconstitutional for states to regulate against them. The United States Constitution and the separation of powers, i.e. Executive, Legislative, and Judicial,  checks and balances reinforces a document that grants and enables rights. It does not strip them away. I'm pretty sure Russian laws do the opposite in relation to  gays and lesbians. As long as any modern country makes a stand on denying people freedom to love whomever they choose, well, that's not a country I will often choose to side with. I mean, it's love. Sorry, arrezzo, I went off topic a bit. I'm trying to look at the bigger picture. Which is, the United States Constitution enables freedom. 
It is not always applied correctly, it's not perfect. But it's there and even if some parts of the government don't always follow it to the letter. I support it. ",1,0,1443998050,1444728054
cvo9smd,0,t1_cvo7tpc,RBMAN,"Calm down Mr. Bigcat30. It's my opinion pal, and I'll stand by it without resorting to name calling and hysteria. I absolutely see where your coming from and believe that there's some truth in the claims you make. My end point is, the United States of America and the Constitution, i.e. the Law of the land is better for world interests than the United Oligarchy or Russia. I know we have problems, but I'd still rather live here than anywhere else... except maybe France 'cuse I love their culture, cheese and wine.
Please buddy, take a walk, breathe some fresh mostly free air, and let's have a real conversation, not name calling. I realize this is r/conspiracy, but a little less paranoia would be cool too.

cvo7jdh,1,t3_3ng5t2,RBMAN,"Well, um, how's the Russian democracy working out? The United States has some problems, but we have a functional representational government. Journalists don't mysteriously die in droves. Our media is consolidated, but not state run. Our oligarchs are many, while Russia's are few. We have yet to see a power hungry dictator like Putin circumvent our political process and stay in power for 20+ years. So, basically this guy makes some populist points, but he's just ridiculous knob job who shots down passenger airplanes and poisons or assassinates his opponents. 
In a choice between a world dominated by the United States interests and one dominated by Russia's. I think a majority of the worlds population would side with the Americans.

I don't like or trust Hillary Clinton, I think she would be a terrible President, and a bad precedent to be set about rotating families in and out of the White House.
But... speaking as a Virginian, Ken Cuccinelli is the biggest tool this state has ever elected. His record speaks for itself, he is not a Libertarian in any stretch of the imagination. He instigated himself time and time again into the private lives of the citizens of  Virginia, the Universities and Private Businesses. He is as much, if not more of a glory hound as Mrs. Clinton. Take everything he says with a grain of salt, regardless of whether you agree with him or not. His views change with the wind. Thank you, Reddit Rocks!",3,0,1443532045,1444728054
