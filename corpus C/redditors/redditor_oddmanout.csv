From what I get, she leased the car from them.  They told her there was a recall and she brought it in. They told her the car is defective and she was expecting to get another leased car, but they instead, somehow, talked her into buying one.  They would have had her SSN because that's required to lease a car, so they probably had it on file from her original lease.",6,0,1444691958,1444721683

Who the fuck chooses to live there? Why??? 

I grew up in South Louisiana where it gets to 100+ and *humid* but at some point humidity ceases to even matter.  At 115 degrees, it's painful no matter how humid or dry it is.  We found some indoor putt putt place, played a round then went home.  Fuck that place.",6,0,1444683543,1444721683

He's going to send you a check, it'll likely be for more than you even asked just to encourage you even more.   You'll deposit the check and send the stuff off.  2-4 weeks later, you'll get a notification from your bank that the check was for an invalid account/stolen/whatever. Then you'll be out your stuff, the cost of shipping, and a $25 NSF charge as well as a wasted day as you waited in line at the post office.
