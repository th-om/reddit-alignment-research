cvx1h1f,0,t1_cvwyku8,dewooPickle,Uh we do already. There called interest payments. Thats it. We dont have to ever actually pay it off to 0. Countries dont retire and die. And with economic growth and inflation there is healthy room for more debt.,8,0,1444667000,1444718016
cvuwlcr,1,t3_3o70nr,dewooPickle,"Lot of good answers but i didnt see anyone mention that a ton of research is sponsored by private companies too, especially in the stem field. Theres also alot of donations. Id be curious how it breaks down percentage wise.",1,0,1444496183,1444718016
cvtzuv0,0,t1_cvtw15b,dewooPickle,So are you going to answer my original question and back up your assertation or just keep bullshiting?,4,0,1444416563,1444718016
cvtoi0k,1,t3_3o3nbq,dewooPickle,Care to expand your hyberbolic statememt. The govt obviously doesnt own everything. What are you thinking they own?,13,0,1444399178,1444718016
cvt0e16,0,t1_cvswvzp,dewooPickle,"Seeing as how it costs anywhere from 30-60k a year just to keep someone in jail and that doesn't even take into account police, courts, DEA, FBI, and lost tax revenue, I would have no problem putting a percentage of tax revenue towards treatment programs. It would be less expensive than our current situation, prevent innocent people from suffering and actually provide help to addicts.",1,0,1444341988,1444718016
cvt09oj,0,t1_cvsuhe4,dewooPickle,"First of all we live in a capitalist society. When something is outlawed, people don't stop doing it they just turn to the black market. Legalizing drugs is more about how we treat drug users rather than being a preventative measure. Second the vast majority of users are not addicts and do not need to be sent to rehab.",0,0,1444341794,1444718016
cvsu6uo,0,t1_cvst34c,dewooPickle,"Legalizing all drugs really. No one seems to talk about the crazy amount of money we spend on the war on drugs. Lost tax income, police, prisons, court systems, DEA, and then all the negative side effects from the black market... So. Much. Money.",6,0,1444332853,1444718016
cvsszy2,1,t3_3nzxrj,dewooPickle,Anyone want to speculate on what this means for the upcoming debt ceiling...,3,0,1444331082,1444718016
cvss3wi,1,t3_3o010b,dewooPickle,Well theoretically based on inflation and growth shouldnt the debt always be increasing. I mean regardless of spending and revenue i just want representation that isnt going to cause a default (biggest concern) or run around like a chicken with their head cut off because of a deficit. ,5,0,1444329775,1444718016
