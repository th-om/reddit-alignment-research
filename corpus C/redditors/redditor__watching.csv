cvxu1zc,0,t1_cvxtpvl,_watching,"Lol unfortunately my friends on fb share it quite a bit. But yeah, I wouldn't call it (the site) feminist - feminist aligned, or feminist publishing, but because that sells online atm, not out of principles. 

Ofc I could just as easily say they are feminist, just really shitty at it. Tl;dr I don't like them much and I don't want to have to defend them in arguments lol",1,1,1444711423,1444719050

Not as bad as people allege or for the same reasons but I wouldn't want someone to get their news there.",1,1,1444710647,1444719050
cvxtlhj,0,t1_cvxt64t,_watching,"Along with HuffPo and other such sites it hosts a lot of low quality/intro - tier pop feminism articles. Since it's also click-hungry, low tier ""news"", it tends to act in ways that are hypocritical. People like to use this as a club against feminism. 

The recent example being the Justin Bieber pictures - apparently someone took inappropriate pictures of him w/o his consent,  and it got posted in multiple places. People have pointed out that sites that criticized the Fappening should not do this, and like to bring it up in arguments with people who are actually against both things because they're pro-consent/privacy.
