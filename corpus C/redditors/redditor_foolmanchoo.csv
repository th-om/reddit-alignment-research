Nothing personal, and if we were sharing a beer, face to face, I'd definitely be more than happy to continue on.

I will say that one man's extreme is another mans perfect fit, I trust you understand that. There are plenty of opinions on how to run the country, and unfortunately for Bernie, you simply disagree with his style and solutions. 

Good luck on your venture to elect whom ever it is that you are backing. Cheers.",2,0,1444605053,1444719931
cvw9iju,0,t1_cvw7pnl,foolmanchoo,"Again we will just have to disagree... To say his views are extremist is fairly extremist in itself. He aligns with a lot of Americans point of view, check those rising poll numbers again.

To say he is bought and paid for by unions is also not in line with reality. Yes, he is very pro Union, but I suggest you look at who exactly has been garnering all the union endorsements as of late, it's not Senator Sanders, but Secretary Clinton. 

In addition, all of his contributions are coming from private citizens. Not the big boogey man of big Union.

On the issue of experience, running a large enterprise such as a corporation is not the same as executing a large government, it's wholeheartedly different... I'd rather have someone who knows the ins and outs of the US congress and its critters, as well as had executive experience such as a mayorship in libertarian/progressive type area. Seems a good fit to me.

In my mind someone who has experience in many levels of government from the executive all the way through both houses of congress, including chairing an important committee, sounds like a well rounded resume to me. He also has had high praise as an honest broker from both sides of the aisle, which says to me that he can work with constituents from many walks of life.

Not too shabby.",0,0,1444597287,1444719931
