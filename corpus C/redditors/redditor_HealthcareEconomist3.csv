cvl2g4b,0,t1_cvjftr9,HealthcareEconomist3,"> Just so I won't be ignorant with my opinion, what's the benefit of raising the minimum wage to $15?

We would have a clear demonstration that ""moderate"" (as in ""economists support a moderate increase in the MW"") is <$15. Also that when even Dube considers $15 too high you should probably listen.

> Wouldn't the cost of living go up effectively slashing any 'net gain' you had?

No, price level changes would be fairly small. We would only be impacting producer costs for those who currently pay <$15 and there would be some efficiency wage effects offsetting the additional labor costs. Actual inflationary effects would increase but would remain extremely small.

> Also isn't minimum wage just for the jobs that basically require zero skill?

Yes. One of the concerns with such a large raise is that it would cause wage compression effects, $15 would be the wage from entry level retail positions through to mid-career supervisory positions. Eventually this would work itself out by pushing up wages elsewhere but the process would be very disruptive.",3,0,1443739842,1444722620

Clearly he understands the standard argument is based upon that of human adaptability, the variety of tasks we can perform is enormous and constantly increasing, which is precisely why we are not horses. A horse has a small number of static tasks and is replaceable, a human can adapt such they can complete new tasks.

In order for the argument to hold for humans there would have to be zero tasks humans will have comparative advantage in which is something that's fundamentally impossible. Even if machines became as good as us at every possible task we would still value humans over machines for some tasks and thus full employment.

Also one point I don't really bring up because it causes people to go all lump of labor, presuming a Turing machine did exist why wouldn't it demand pay? People keep assuming that machines smarter then us would remain our tools rather then becoming labor themselves. ",0,0,1443739192,1444722620

Yes, that's why it an awesome phrase. No one knows what quantity is implied by it :)

> Generally though, it is because persistent deficits are not necessarily benign expression of panglossian market forces.

+1. If the EU & US would stop protecting local agriculture and screwing with SPS to lock out developing economy imports the situation would reverse, development across most of Africa (but particularly DRC down) would massively accelerate and food prices would fall across the world.

Its pretty staggering just how much they could supply if they were allowed to access our markets.

>  I don't think there are that many people diagnosing Africa's ills who think that really, their issue is that they aren't enough dependent on foreign primary resources.

The point is more that even today with the least developed economies they are sufficiently wealthy and a sufficient agricultural excess exists worldwide that we can meet their food needs. Even if in a century they were in a similar net importer position as today would it really matter? Even if development only continues at its current pace and they don't follow the rapid development path of China & India all but four would be on the high end of middle-income in a century.",4,0,1443731221,1444722620

Much of the corn consumed in Africa today (where corn is the staple across most countries) is grown in the US, even if we ignore the rapid pace of development in developing economies (its doubtful that we will have more then one or two low-income countries in a century, if any at all) why would you expect a change in the distribution of arable land to have more then short-term food security implications when we already regularly trade food around the world?

> as the aper itself notes--more extreme weather conditions will have a large effect.

Indeed, also very difficult to project. I would certainly expect extreme weather to cause food security issues as it does today and there is certainly a policy conversation that needs to occur there. As to the claim that worldwide agricultural output is going to decline as the result of climate change though this is clearly false.",5,0,1443665019,1444722620
