cvvpjwt,0,t1_cvpbgd2,EuroYankee,"Sorry - that was a cut and paste from a response that I had used also often when Froma Harrop (https://twitter.com/fromaharrop) managed to syndicate an execrable piece of Clintonista propaganda, and it started popping up all over the web - I added it into the doc out of convenience so I could cut and paste responses. Now that I know there is interest in my little project, I will clean up this sort of thing for the next version 2.0 (after the debate). Thanks for your patience.",1,0,1444562072,1444722895

cvvpdf6,0,t1_cvnrmpk,EuroYankee,"As I mention up top, this is not supposed to be a universal tract - take from it what you find useful - it is a personal collection so obviously not everyone agrees with everything I think. That said, I think the whole BLM matter is - thank God - moot at this point, so I will probably remove that bit from v2.0 anyway. I do, however, stand by my thoughts about Soros in general and his support for Hillary being an indication that while she may be righteous on social issues, she is with the billionaires on economic ones.",1,0,1444561246,1444722895
