These are kind of contradicting goals. You'll have to choose if you want the large upper body or defined abs. Defined abs are typically  starting at sub 12% body fat, really show under 10%. This is where the bulk/cut cycles really start to help. Bulk to get your muscles larger (abs included), and then cut to really show your gains. 

As for a program, you know what muscles you really want to target so look for something that includes those. And if you're looking to increase size, higher weight and lower reps, so 3 sets of 3-5 reps would be good for that. Sets of 6-8 are good for a mix bulk/endurance, and 8-12 are more endurance training. 

Straight from wiki

>Strength training typically produces a combination of the two different types of hypertrophy: contraction against 80 to 90% of the one-repetition maximum for 2–6 repetitions (reps) causes myofibrillated hypertrophy to dominate (as in powerlifters, Olympic lifters and strength athletes), whereas several repetitions (generally 8–12 for bodybuilding or 12 or more for muscular endurance) against a submaximal load facilitates mainly sarcoplasmic hypertrophy (professional bodybuilders and endurance athletes).",1,0,1444707863,1444717087

cvxg2xo,0,t1_cvx9nr3,MeowTheMixer,">It really is ridiculous how cable is the only legitimate option for seeing some shows (at least at the time of release).

Like you, if I ever want to see a TV series I will stream it wherever i can find it or torrent it. I feel bad for doing it, but I frankly don't have time to sit through painfully stupid and irrelevant cable ads.

Then just wait the year until it's on netflix. Yeah, cable sucks and is expensive but watching it at release has that added premium. 

The cable companies should make it easier to watch, but complaining about it at release is kind of childish . Justify pirating the show however you want.  ",4,0,1444688395,1444717087
