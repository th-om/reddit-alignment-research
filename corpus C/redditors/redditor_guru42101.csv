Last year's election I could barely find any useful info on the individuals running for county magistrate, clerk, sheriff, or even state representative. Almost all didn't have a website and many didn't even have a facebook page. As someone who gets their news from sources from areas outside of the local news, the only information I had to go on was what other signs were usually present with theirs in yards.",1,0,1444670030,1444728428

In OP's situation I'd have two possible responses: no emotional response, I'm glad your ok, and should we report it to the police; OR I'm going to hunt that guy down and beat him to death. The later option doesn't work to well in civilized society. As my counselor put it I'm a very large bomb with a very very long fuse. Most likely, if something pushed me past my current breaking point my response would be considered appropriate (e.g. someone physically harming someone in front of me).",2,0,1444180666,1444728428
