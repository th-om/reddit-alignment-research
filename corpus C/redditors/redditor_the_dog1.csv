That means we won't always have the best governments, but everyone will have a say in it. If a stupid person makes a stupid choice then so be it. It's a worthy trade off to allow society to select it's government.   ",3,0,1444540304,1444724570

Your problem with Obama and Syria apparently has nothing to do with us policy in Syria, considering your entire post is blaming the us for how it interacted with other countries. Want to try that again with actual Syrian policy? But since your probably a troll, I bet you don't even know what us policy in Syria is.

And this stuff if comedy gold. The world howled for years about how evil the us was for invading Iraq and getting rid of the the dictator there, who was killing his own people. Now you cry that we aren't doing enough to stop these other countries? Guess what, they are all powerful dictatorships. Removing them requires invasions. You listed 3-4 areas we should invade? I'm sure the world will just love that. Also, You want us to do more, better be prepared to pay up. Building a responsible democratic country in the Middle East cost a couple trillion each, and you want to make 4.",-5,0,1444539632,1444724570
cvvj9ew,0,t1_cvv5j9b,the_dog1,"This is insane. How many countries today hate us because we supported their unpopular leaders in the name of us self interest? A. Lot. Of. Them.

Now we are supposed to support Assad? A massive civil war has been raging to get rid of him! He has no ability to run Syria, and is owned by Putin and couldn't give a damn about US support or not. We support him now and Syria will hate us for at least the next 50 years. Because guess what. Assad hates us, so if he wins Putin gets a new de-facto colony and the regime builds hate against Americans, and if the rebels win they know we sold them out for their mass murdering dictator friend. Hence they hate us. For gods sake how many countries and nations do we have to isolate and turn into enemies before we finally learn to tell dictators to screw off. It almost never works. South Korea was one of the few times this tactic played out well.

The Middle East will be a disaster as long as strong men can use it as their playground. Saudi Arabia is certainly a problem that needs to be fixed, but one problem at a time here. Assad is not the answer, supporting him will set us back until the 2080s at least.  

Also this post is hilarious. It's almost a proven fact Assad used chemical weapons. Multiple organizations have now run investigations and said he is by far the most likely culprit, or is the culprit. The random reddit poster who loves Assad disagrees? I wonder why. ",6,0,1444538774,1444724570

Really it was only a matter of time before Russia stepped in the start wrapping things up. Putin Knows he can send troops where he wants, when he wants, to do what he wants with no more than angry notes of protest.

If your upset not every moment of your life is spent happy, dunno what to tell you there. The happiest man on earth is sad and upset some of the time.

You can't really think these 5 people are furthering a conflict with 100,000s of combatants. ",-1,0,1443409418,1444724570
