Really nice city, and it's got an amazing school system! Perfect for raising a family. ",1,0,1444709924,1444719383
cvwxfz9,0,t1_cvwu4yq,Reidmill,"Most people within the deaf community have ""sign names."" These are specific signs that they like to go by, and usually indicate something about their personality. 

If my name was Jeff, and I loved cars, my sign name would probably involve the signed letter for ""J"" and some sign that involved cars or driving. This is usually the case for people who get involved in the deaf community later in life.

Though this isn't always the case. If you were born deaf or have deaf parents, than your parents would assign you a sign name. It would incorporate probably the first letter of your name and some other word that they want to associate with you, like ""hope"" or ""love."" 

If you're signing a name in a song or introducing yourself to someone you haven't met then you would spell your name out. ",7,0,1444660216,1444719383
