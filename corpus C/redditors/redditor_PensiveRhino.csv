cviozca,0,t1_cvikbb5,PensiveRhino,"I really don't know how to respond to such vitriol, and the straw men are everywhere. I'm not going to bother arguing with you, you're probably too set in your own extreme left dogma anyway. I think your problem here is that you're conflating *profit* with *monopolistic corporations gouging people*. Further, I think you're conflating your beliefs on what you think **ought** to be with reality. Your ideal world isn't the ideal world of everyone; I would even go so far as to suggest that practically no one believes that the very concept of profit is itself evil or cruel.

Suffice it to say, if you think earning a profit by providing goods and services to people is evil, you should pause to consider that it is **NOT** the end goal. Profit is a means to another end, usually to provide for one's own expenses and the expenses of a family.

Maybe you ought to pause to consider how much of that is you talking, and how much of it came from others that taught or influenced you. Perhaps then you'd realize that I'm not the one that's sick or being controlled.",1,0,1443569373,1444722155
cvifir5,0,t1_cvie6sn,PensiveRhino,"How would you get anyone to participate in such a society? Absent a profit motive, why should anyone get involved with society at large? Why should anyone make your computer, install your internet cables, or anything else if they're not going to profit from it? Perhaps you ought step away from your idealism for a moment, because you seem to have neglected human nature itself, that all humans are by their nature greedy, that we do unpleasant things only to improve our own lot, and the lot of our family. Yes, people can rise above it, but never could you expect all people to find motivation without the potential for profit.",1,0,1443555048,1444722155
cvdxmif,1,t3_3m6llv,PensiveRhino,"**TL;DR:** depends on who you ask, and you probably won't see this anyway (either by down-vote or burying)

Proponents of the general movement known as ""Social Justice"" often look to a more generalized definition, that it seeks to right the wrongs generated by the nature of a society, including but not limited to racial, economic, and gender discrimination. However, the movement is less than cohesive, and there are several variations and interpretations of what the concept means and should mean.

The problem I have with the Social Justice movement is that they like to hide behind the veil of this dictionary definition, and use it to deflect the question you've asked. In my experience, the movement often overlooks, and sometimes downright ignores or opposes, the rights and legal struggles of those they perceive as ""advantaged"". For example, on the issue of male circumcision, most SJPs (Social Justice Proponent) I have encountered in my tenure as an internet lurker  generally oppose banning it, even though it has been scientifically proven to be in every way analogous to female circumcision, generally defending the practice on grounds of aesthetics (which I personally find morally reprehensible, but I digress).

All of this having been said, it's a very tricky topic, filled with propaganda both for and against it. You should take **everything** that someone says on the topic with a grain of salt, and do your own research. I'm not trying to tell you that SJPs or their opponents are trying to deceive you, just to be aware that each side sees reality through a lens; however, this is true for pretty much any issue you'd care to talk about.

**EDIT** Forgot to mention, I'd be happy to elaborate on my personal opinions of the topic in further comments, but for now I don't want to poison the well.

The problem we're having in this country is that wealth is getting too concentrated in the upper echelons, then being sequestered, never again to see the light of day. We want to tax the rich at a higher rate, because the rich won't be hurt by it as much as the Ultra-Right think.

I've been toying around with this idea a bit, and would like to hear some opinions on it. Why not have a tax rate that increases as a linear function of your income? For example, if you make an income i, in thousands, then your tax rate r = .2i + 5, then cut it off once it hits something like 55% or 60%.",2,0,1436755801,1444722155
