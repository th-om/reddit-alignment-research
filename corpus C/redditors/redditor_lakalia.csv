cvf3b77,0,t1_cvf388u,lakalia,"Lol, thank you for that. I know I need to chill the fuck out which is why I said I have anxiety so it makes me think stupid irrational thoughts. Which is why I came here to ask for help because I figured I could get a more rational point of view than my own",1,0,1443297587,1444723403
cvf0r53,0,t1_cvf0lrp,lakalia,I have slowly been starting to realize this. I actually found this link through /pol/ on 4chan and they seem to freak the fuck out about any little thing that is posted about any war. That's what legit scared me,1,0,1443292776,1444723403
cvf0i9v,0,t1_cvf08gg,lakalia,"I posted a link above. I also tend to search for things in google about this subject and it seems every ""opinion"" I read agrees we are super close. And that scares me. But then there are the ones who say it won't happen anytime soon. I don't know. I just have terrible anxiety so it's hard to not be irrational about shit like this I hear",1,0,1443292319,1444723403
cvew2t2,0,t1_cvevqyf,lakalia,"China or Russia. It's just the constant remarks of ""We may use nuclear measures"" or ""so and so said they will attack the U.S. With nukes"" and shit like this. I don't know if the news exaggerates to scared us or I don't know. But it's frightening",2,0,1443284140,1444723403
cveulhc,1,t3_3mgyh7,lakalia,"I want to say thank you for that doomsday clock lol which is why I asked here because I felt my fears were irrational and I remember hearing we've been closer before but everyone I see who stands on these issues insists we are there. I just ask, how many conflicts and nuclear threats do we have until the camel back breaks?",1,0,1443281309,1444723403
cveu1oi,1,t3_3mgh57,lakalia,"I think the thing that really made my anxiety shoot up is the prophecy stuff. I don't know why. And also reading political forums where everyone ""agrees"" that we are going to end a ww3. ",4,0,1443280206,1444723403
cveu07y,0,t1_cvetria,lakalia,Sorry about the comment. I'm American myself but these things I am seeing they are on every other countries news and I haven't seen it at all our news. I wish they would show us so other Americans would know too. ,3,0,1443280121,1444723403
