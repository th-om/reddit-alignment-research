Post copy-pasted in case the thread can't be read: Ok, I went digging through my hard drive and found a small writeup of what I've dug up so far that I did for TFR years ago. Some of the research was mine (I remember flipping through Tuchman to figure out what her source was) and some is stuff that I found other people discussing on some really crusty WW1 history forums, but everything I took from that was people looking at original accounts I didn't have access to. Don't consider it definitive, but I think it's pretty illuminating. 

The other thing I want to emphasize before I get started on this is that this story was pretty popular in the British wartime press, and the British press at this time was no too shy about telling a nice story or lying outright to paint a good picture for the home front. Remember: these are the same guys who printed pictures of victims of Russian anti-Jewish pogroms with the caption ""German atrocities in Belgium."" The ""Machine Guns at Mons"" story is just perfect for that kind of thing - it plays up the supposed superiority not only of the British soldier (so well trained he can fire a round a second!) but also the weapon the military is arming them with (so well designed it can sustain that kind of firepower!). 

In full disclosure I have a bit of a reputation in TFR of being very, very not impressed by the Enfield. The whole reason I looked into this 'mistaken for an MG' stuff in the first place is because it is constantly cited by the most insufferable Enfield fanboys who insist it is the most superior bolt action firearm ever designed. I'm of the opinion that it is mediocre and at the time of WW1 was merely an adequate rifle that they could not replace as planned in 1914 because of the outbreak of war. 

Anyways, on Mons:

Any time you dig deep on that MG legend it gets more and more ephemeral the further back you track it. You will find many people pointing to Tuchman’s “Guns of August,” where she cites the memoirs of a soldier named Smith-Dorrien. He gives no solid source for his belief that the Germans mistook their rifle fire for machine guns, which begs the question of how he knew what the Germans were thinking. There is no good evidence that he had special access to prisoners, for example. 

The other major source I’ve found on this is the official “History of the Great War based on Official Documents” that was directed by Sir James Edmonds. There are some references to him saying that the Germans were mistaking rifle fire for MG fire. However, these are largely taken out of context. Edmonds goes to a lot of effort to talk about the disposition of the British MGs (they did have them at Mons) and their effectiveness. The section that people usually talk about has him saying that the Germans were faced with intense rifle fire that they could not distinguish from the incoming machine gun fire. This is important, because just after this he describes how British soldiers were able to neutralize a German MG nest once they determined its location by turning their own MGs on it. This wasn’t an instance of the Germans thinking that British riflemen were machine gunners, but of the general level of fire coming from the British lines being such that they couldn’t pinpoint where the MGs were, much to their detriment. 

The other really troublesome point as far as these things go is that you find constant mentions in the memoirs of German officers - Bloem and Von Kluck are easy to get - of the intense fire at Mons that distinguishes between rifle and MG fire. There are a couple of books that come out in the 20s from Germany that seem to play up “machine guns behind every hedge” in the opening stages of the war, but they are written in a very heroic manner that juxtaposes that implacable opposition with the heroism of the German soldier making the early advances. I personally suspect that these are less of a true account of the number of MGs at the early battles or German beliefs that they faced an inflated number of MGs and more literary license on the part of patriotic authors trying to write heroic war stories about a fight that was ultimately lost.

Finally, I would also point out that the idea of the ‘Mad Minute’ wasn’t unique to the British, although they were alone in being quite so exuberant about it (the shooting competitions with cash prizes, the well publicized records of extremely fast shooters, etc). The Germans trained to create beaten zones of rifle fire, a tactic that went back to when rifles had the range to be deadly far beyond their aimed accuracy but machine guns were not widely available to lay down that kind of suppressive fire. They even used spotters to determine range and judge the effectiveness, much the same way that forward observers are used for artillery work and that MGs were ranged in at that time. (See Zuber’s “The Battle of the Frontiers” for a good account of this German technique). In fact, it was the relative inferiority of the Enfield at this kind of extreme long range suppressing action in the open fields of S. Africa during the Boer War (the Boers had a lot of Mauser rifles, so the comparison was direct) that was one of the major pushes to replace the Enfield in the years immediately before the war. If WW1 hadn’t happened the P-14 would have replaced it in short order. 

Another thing to consider is that the British were not alone in having effective rifle fire when on the defense. The Belgians managed to slow down opposed pontoon crossings by the Germans quite effectively in a number of locations without large numbers of MGs, and in some instances none at all. Rifles of this age were accurate, devastating, and reasonably quick firing. “Mad Minute” aside it is trivial for even an untrained person to put 15 rounds through them a minute. While this doesn't address the myth itself it should be remembered that rifles were deadly enough in their own right at this time and many other forces managed decisively withering fire with rifles alone, especially at the early stages of the war. I think that half the reason that the British became so associated with this feat is that they had such a major emphasis on it before the war that, again, was highly publicized to the public via newspapers etc. even before the conflict began. 

In the end I think the Mons MG myth is the result of very intense British small arms fire leading the Germans to have unreliable estimates on the numbers and locations of the MGs, much to their detriment. This had less to do with the super-engineered Enfield Rifle or the super-human abilities of the Old Contemptibles and more to do with the way that the Germans were advancing into interlocking fields of fire and were in a pretty unfortunate situation on that day. I strongly doubt anyone mistook a rifle company for an emplaced machine gun, but the rifle fire was certainly intense enough that it made the location of those MGs difficult to determine. The MG myth is just the exaggeration of a kernel of truth that is far less dramatic than the notion that the British Tommy, coupled with his trusty Enfield, was so skilled at rapid fire that if he wasn’t a replacement for an MG (the iconic harbinger of death on WW1 battlefields) than he and a few of his trusty mates could do a good impression of one. This isn’t to say that British rifle fire wasn’t devastating at Mons - it was - but this wasn’t the unique feat of British soldiers with a uniquely British weapon. It was a product of the way war had developed across the previous half century.

TL;DR: At the Battle of Mons the British had machine guns positioned to give overlapping fields of fire. This, combined with fast firing infantry resulted in it being difficult to spot the machine gun nests. You did not get a few Tommies being a replacement for a machine gun.",1,0,1444685559,1444722757

Again, ISIS using religion as a rallying point. People go out to fight saying they fight for Muhammad and the Caliphate. Religion is a effective banner for these people and ignoring it won't help.
