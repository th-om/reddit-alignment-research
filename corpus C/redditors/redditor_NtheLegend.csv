cvxqo7z,0,t1_cvxphh2,NtheLegend,"Looking at your numbers and mileage, you're going to finish that marathon, but you're not going to do it faster than five hours. 12 minute pace puts you at about 5h15m.

Don't worry about pace, just worry about finishing. Then don't even worry about that.",2,0,1444705146,1444724714
cvvxwiw,1,t3_3oc7im,NtheLegend,"It's really weird, primarily because the typeface doesn't work at all. Choose a far more standard typeface, get rid of all the black outlines and I'd choose a brighter shade of purple against that gray background..",4,0,1444582936,1444724714

cvvecrd,1,t3_3oa6by,NtheLegend,"I just Jumped to the Nexus 6 on T-Mo yesterday and I am really enjoying it so far. The specs are crazy, the screen/phone is huge, bezels are small, but it is a slippery phone in the hand without a case. It's like holding a wedge of glass. At this point, I'm set for whatever comes out next year.",3,0,1444529197,1444724714
