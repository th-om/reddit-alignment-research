Moreover, I actually wanted to. The self-selection by interest, the explicitly structured socialization, the multilateral desire to be nice, the leeway and the mutual foreignness took a lot of the extra weight off me.",1,0,1444705500,1444718924

I live in the tropics, a few degrees away from the equator, and I'm trying to figure out what the analogue would be (make myself uncomfortably warmer?), given that heat reduces productivity, and coldness helps me concentrate. It does seem that some forms of comfort (like doing these things here) would be relatively good for production.",2,0,1444616923,1444718924
