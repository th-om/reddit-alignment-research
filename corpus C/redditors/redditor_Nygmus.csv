cvxuijq,0,t1_cvxtgpn,Nygmus,"Which comes out to about 2k per monster outside of doubles, which comes about a hundred shy of 6k experience per run. But thanks for the exact numbers!",1,0,1444712500,1444717922
cvxs7wg,0,t1_cvxrzd7,Nygmus,"It's much, much less efficient compared to a single monster running three lowbies through the level.

You get roughly 6k experience per run on Aiden Hell with a single carrier, spread among three monsters. You get, what, a few hundred per scroll *if* Giant drops scrolls?",2,0,1444707752,1444717922
cvxrt97,1,t3_3ogsp2,Nygmus,"One note: there are slowdown issues, I believe, with the downloaded version of the game, particularly when particle-heavy effects like magic occur. I have observed these myself.

The UMD version, I'm told, does not experience these issues. I do not know if they occur in emulated mode on the Vita.",2,0,1444707062,1444717922
cvxkzz6,0,t1_cvxjhx1,Nygmus,"""Poor technique"" describes a lot of saw injuries, too, I would imagine.",1,0,1444696343,1444717922
cvxjerx,0,t1_cvxjb2i,Nygmus,"Well, yeah, the gas station was unintentional, but the fact that there was an explosion wasn't.

The gas station was therefore just collateral damage, another thing that's not ever unexpected around Henderson.",4,0,1444693785,1444717922
cvxj6z9,0,t1_cvx5j35,Nygmus,"Basically, yeah. The chaps are full of fibrous material that expands into fluff when the teeth hit it and strangles the saw's drive. Bitch to clean out, but a lot easier to fix than what it'll do *without* the chaps.",5,0,1444693435,1444717922
cvxj45d,0,t1_cvxi2sz,Nygmus,"Pretty much.

The important things to protect are your legs and face, because most of your injuries are going to come when the saw either slips and comes for your legs, or to your upper body when it catches on something and kicks upward. Rough spot or, worse, something like an old nail buried inside the wood, it'll catch the chain and that saw is coming for you.

Arm injuries are, I believe, quite a bit less common and are more commonly caused by people not holding the saw correctly than by anything it's going to naturally do.",2,0,1444693306,1444717922
cvxizqh,1,t3_3ogrqb,Nygmus,"My dad used to work for a vendor of this type of equipment. He'd go all over this chunk of the country doing trainings and sales seminars, making sure retailers knew about this crap and things like that.

He had a pretty cool job in some respects.",1,0,1444693095,1444717922
cvxiwwo,0,t1_cvxij1l,Nygmus,That's true too.,1,0,1444692966,1444717922
cvxgxy7,0,t1_cvxea7e,Nygmus,"People kept asking what it meant, and he implied it was something salacious when he kept saying ""not till you're older"" and such.",2,0,1444689764,1444717922
