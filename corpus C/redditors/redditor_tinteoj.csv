cvwnvqz,0,t1_cvwm2xi,tinteoj,"True, but they still like to think of themselves as the ""vanguard,"" in the Marxist-Leninist sense. Francis Fukuyama (neocon political philosopher), for one, wrote about it. His ""The End of History"" is an ""updating"" of Marx; ""liberal democrasy"" replaces communism as history's final stage.

If you know to look for it, you *can* see quite a few Marxist beginnings to the philosophy. Utterly corrupted Marxism, of course, but it is there. It is no less revolutionary, just without any class-consiousness, whatsoever.",1,0,1444628510,1444731790

Really, ""Tea Party Republican, with an emphasis on 'state-rights'"" is a pretty good description.

To be completely honest, though, he has never really been someone I have studied on an academic/intellectual level, so take my description with a grain of salt.",6,0,1444608942,1444731790

She was  a foreign policy advisor, as well as first woman to be the US's ambassador to the UN.  Her big thing was advocating the US cooperate with authoritarian regimes, provided they were against the Soviets, and was a big advocate of (illegally) arming the Contras in Nicaragua.",8,0,1444602844,1444731790

You're using ""neo-con"" incorrectly. Neoconservatism is a pretty broad brush, but an inherent part of the ideology is an interventionist foreign policy. Neoconservatism was developed by formerly liberal, socialists, and Trotskyists disillusioned with the ""New Left"" of the 1960s, mainly on not taking a hard enough line against the Soviet Union, as well as a perceived growing anti-Semiticism (many of the early neo-cons were Jewish) amongst the left.

I agree with the substance of your point, but I have my Masters in poltical science, concentrating on American ideologies of the Right, so I have taken it as my personal mission to correct the misuse of labels. (""Neoliberal"" is another one a lot of people get wrong!)

Again, though, totally agree with the main point you were making.",19,0,1444596502,1444731790
