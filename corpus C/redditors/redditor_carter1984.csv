NC tax rates were 6, 7, and 7.75%. Now, everyone pays the same rate of 5.75%...looks like EVERYONE got their income taxes lowered. 

So...considering that even people earning $20K got a tax break...what math did the fine folks at occupy.com employ to determine that they will pay $7 more?",1,0,1444479329,1444719483
cvup66r,1,t3_3nqhdg,carter1984,"Man the biased crap that gets posted in this sub sometimes just boggles my mind.

EVERYONE received a tax cut, they weren't just for ""the rich"". NC standardized the income tax rate at 5.75%.

Also worth pointing out is that this article doesn't mention NC going from a huge deficit to a $400 million surplus because of changes in the tax code.

I don't mind reading alternate points of view, but this drivel should be banned from consumption since it is nothing more than democrat propaganda that is twisting statics to suite their agenda. Unfortunately it also influences people who don't know any better than to question what they are force fed from crap sites like occupy.com.",0,0,1444477832,1444719483

I continually surprised at how few places require the use of a break pad. I have found some across the US that do, but most shy away from the practice, even though it will protect their tables in the long run. I have heard that are required in many rooms in other countries.

I felt genuinely impressed by Kaminsky's willingness to accommodate a hornets fan in the midst of his personal time. I think this speaks to the guy's character. I wanted to post because we are all hornets fans here, and I thought other fans might like to know that he was a really nice guy (at least to me - even in a Duke shirt) at a time when it wasn't ""expected"" (like a public hornets event).

cvot127,0,t1_cvo5y6g,carter1984,"Seeing this almost makes me wonder if social media doesn't play as much a role as guns do. I've seen statistics posted that show overall declines in gun violence, but increases in mass shootings. 

In Oregon, we saw the shooter posting on 4chan. In Virginia, the shooter even shot video for posting online. Are these ""beta-males"" finding the internet culture to be their catalyst, knowing that attention will come through the form of tweets, facebook posts, and a social media frenzy over their actions?

It seems like their was a concerted effort years ago to stop publicizes serial killers in order to prevent them from seeking the attention they wanted in the press and popular media. I don't think serial killers have gone away, but when was the last time you heard about one in the national news. Could a similar tactic work in preventing mass shootings, where they are not reported on nationally, tweeted on, shared on social media sites, and therefore lacking in the national media spotlight that some of these shooters obviously are aiming for?",1,0,1444045105,1444719483
