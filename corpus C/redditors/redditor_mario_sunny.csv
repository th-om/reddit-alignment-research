This is a problem in general with large subreddits. The ability to instantaneously karma nuke users is a huge deterrent to dissenting opinion. Over time one ideology wins and it becomes very hard to break.",1,1,1444717305,1444718576

> 1. Every voter has a conflict of interest. No one can vote objectively, since the state has the power to funnel resources to any interest group on a whim. Welfare recipients vote for more welfare. Unions vote for minimum wage hikes. Business owners vote for business subsidies. etc.
> 2. It makes people resentful toward each other. When everybody is living at the expense of everyone else, a vote is an implicit statement that you want your neighbor to be robbed.
> 3. It separates responsibility from action. No one ever takes the blame when things go south. The citizens blame the politicians, and the politicians claim they are acting on the will of the citizenry.
> 4. It encourages short-term behavior. Politicians do not ""own"" the government in the same way a monarch does, and therefore have no incentive to steer the country toward long-term growth. Inevitably, there is a emphasis placed on consumption rather than savings, short-term ""feel good"" policies over long-term sustainable policies, drug use, divorce, the rejection of personal responsibility, and all sorts of perverse outcomes.

OK, so we are assuming that the market (which is really just *people*) is incompetent and/or evil for whatever reason. How is putting a bunch of people in charge of the market going to solve this problem? We would have to assume that the regulators are some sort of incorruptible saints.

I believe that moral relativism has just become the default position. If people actually think through how a system of moral relativism would work they'll discover that they're not really relativists. The problem is most people don't do that. So relativism persists and you get these weird realms like ""government"" where up is down and left is right and there is no consistency with the real world.",1,0,1444706843,1444718576

cvxqtgt,1,t3_3oj4w7,mario_sunny,"On your arguments against the social contract:

I think that the arguments you present are very convincing, but I do not think they are the most convincing arguments against the compact theory. I think that a really good test of the morality of a particular government action is to simply imagine that action being performed by a private individual(s). If one finds the action performed by private individual(s) morally impermissible, then by the law of moral universalism, one must find the same action performed by public individual(s) morally impermissible.

I usually take this approach because many people reject the premise that the individual is the most basic unit of moral analysis, and thus will reject any moral claim which relies on this premise. However, you will be hard-pressed to find someone who truly does not believe that moral rules should be universal. No sane, rational human being would accept the proposition that rape is wrong, except if the woman is attractive.

In this case, one only has to imagine a contract which is conditionally refusable and whose terms can change at any time and for any reason. Obviously, people would find such a contract morally impermissible. But this is *exactly* the social contract. By the law of moral universalism, the social contract cannot be morally acceptable. 

P.S. Your section on the critiques of individualism is very enlightening. ",2,0,1444705383,1444718576
