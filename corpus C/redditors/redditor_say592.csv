I also know of at least one brewery in the area that was using a 3bbl and might be willing to provide some insight as well, though you guys definitely have some special concerns with your space (or should I say lack of).

cvxqq7g,0,t1_cvxnzri,say592,"Historic Preservation might come into play with your location, so be sure to ask about that. You will probably want to do electric, because I don't see steam or direct fire being viable for your location. By all means, don't rule them out, but unless you moved where in the building you are brewing, I don't think you will be able to get the required ventilation and makeup air for direct fire.

cvwukeh,1,t3_3of3ou,say592,"I had a first gen 360 as well. This is significantly better. For one, the button is larger and domed on the top, so it doesnt hurt your finger if you need to hold it like the 360. It provides a distinct click when you press it. Its a solid button. 

Unfortunately I havent had a chance to play with a gen 2 Moto 360. However, based on my experience with the gen 1 and the Huawei, I would say dont let any hesitation about the button deter your purchase. ",2,0,1444653703,1444728038

cvwhxvr,0,t1_cvw94ja,say592,"This has always been on my list of things to do if I win the lottery, except instead of stocks, it is one of the lower volume bitcoin markets. I call the concept ""The thrashing whale"", and I have posted about it before. 

Basically you take a medium sized exchange with less liquidity than you have money. You enter market buy orders to drive the price up an incredible amount and maintain it for a short time. Then you sell it back down. If done correctly, you should be able to make enough people lose faith in the small exchange that it goes out of business. Assuming you still have funds, rinse and repeat at another exchange. The biggest part of this is every one of these incidents also weakens confidence in Bitcoin, which drives the price down and increases the power of your dollars, thus enabling your plan to continue.
