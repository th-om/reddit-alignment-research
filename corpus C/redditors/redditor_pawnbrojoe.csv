cvtnobs,1,t3_3o0quo,pawnbrojoe,"Not from there but the Burial site of Genghis Khan. According to [Jack Waterford's-Genghis Khan](http://www.amazon.com/Genghis-Khan-Making-Modern-World/dp/1491513705)

>An often repeated account maintains that the soldiers in his funeral cortege killed every person and animal encounter on the forty-day journey, and that after the secret burial, eight hundred horsemen trampled repeatedly over the area to obscure the location of the grave.  Then, According to these imaginative accounts, the horsemen were, in turn, killed by yet another set of soldiers so that they could not report on the location of the site. [...]

>After the secret burial in his homeland soldiers sealed off the entire are for several hundred square miles.  No one could enter except members of Genghis Khan's family and a tribe of specially trained warriors who were station there to kill every intruder.  For nearly 800 years this area, the Ikh Khorig or Great Taboo, remained closed.  [...] 

>In the twentieth century, to assure that the area of Genghis Kahn's burial did not become a rallying point for nationalist, the Soviet rules kept it securely guarded. Instead of calling it the Great Taboo [...] the soviets called it by the bureaucratic designation of ""Highly Restricted Area."" [...] The Soviets further sealed it off by surrounding 1 million hectares of the Highly Restricted area with an equally larger Restricted Area.  To prevent travel within the area the government built neither roads nor bridges during the Communist era.  The Soviets maintained a highly fortified MiG air base, and quite probably a storehouse of nuclear weapons, between the Restricted area and the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar.  A large Soviet tank base blocked the entrance to the forbidden zone, and the Russian Military used the area for artillery practice and tank maneuvers.

TL;DR After Ghengis Kahn's death the Mongol's sealed off several hundred miles around his burial site.  When the USSR took over they sealed off an even bigger area to prevent Mongolian Nationalism. IIRC the area is highly toxic from Soviet actions and is still restricted.
