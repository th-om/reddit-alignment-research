The United States produces 75% of the world's supply, which is a byproduct of natural gas production.  There are huge storage reserves in Texas and the price is set by the federal government.

Besides being used in balloons, helium is used in so many technology industries so the demand for it has greatly increased, which has reduce the available reserves.

To meet supply & demand, the federal government has increased the price and limit the amount that is available at any period of time.  So...the worldwide shortage is more of an artificial shortage.",3,0,1444705660,1444721258
cvxqnvs,1,t3_3oj56s,BKGPrints,There are probably a few helium tanks still around.  The balloons were to identify the different rally points.,1,0,1444705132,1444721258
cvxq7zm,0,t1_cvxpg0z,BKGPrints,"> Political parties do affect the economy.

See...This is an example of you basing an opinion on certain facts but excluding other factors.

What I stated was that the basis on rather the economy does well or not is not *solely* based on which political party is in office.

Yes...Policy, regulations and laws do have an effect on the economy (sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse) and it might have an immediate impact on the economy but then again, it might take months or years for it to happen.

As I said, there are so many other factor & variables.

>  There is a clear correlation between the performance of the economy and the policies of governments.

There are three kinds of lies: *Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics*.

Basically it means that you are trying to use numbers to correlate two variables as total proof of your opinion.  The problem is, it ignores every other variable out there.

> Anyone who says otherwise is denying basic facts.

Reread my first response.

> ALSO.... SHOW YOUR SOURCES TO BACK UP YOUR CLAIMS!!!!!

Wooaahh now...There's no need for the yelling.

cvxpokk,1,t3_3oj7jz,BKGPrints,"The problem isn't that there's not enough water.  The problem is that the water isn't where it's needed.

In California, the reason that there's a water shortage is because the demand for it has outpaced the replenishment of water sources by natural means (basically rain or snow).

There are other reasons as well, such as politics, regulations and laws that also hampered access to water sources.

In regards to converting seawater to fresh water, also known as desalination, it's very expensive to do and a desalination plant can only produce so much fresh water that meets nowhere near the total daily needs.

In regards to the polar ice caps melting, where do you think that the melted water is going?  Right back into the world's ocean.",1,0,1444703554,1444721258

cvxp8kg,1,t3_3oj2ou,BKGPrints,"> In everything that has to do with the economy; income growth, stock markets, employment rates; the Democrats are better than Republicans.

Anyone who thinks that rather the economy does well or not based on which political party maintains the Presidency at the time has no basic understanding of economics.

> This is all based off of objective facts.

No...Your basing your opinion on certain facts but excludes so many other factors or variables.

> Who got us into the Great Depression?

Umm...That would be market speculation and the access of easy money.

> Who got us out?

Umm...World War II basically helped end the Great Depression.  None of FDR's programs under the *New Deal* actually helped to end the Great Depression...and in some cases actually sent the country back into a short recession.

> Who got us into the Great Recession?

The economic turmoil in late 2008 had its start almost two decades before under both, a Republican and Democratic president.

Again, the cause was because of market speculation and access to easy money.

> Who got us out?

You're more than welcome to provide examples of how policy set forth by President Obama *actually* helped the economy recover.

The reality is, the economy recovered (recovering) because the market is correcting itself...not because of any policy set forth by this administration.

Give credit where credit is due for the recovery of the economy.  To the millions of people who get up everyday to go to work to provide for their families, the small business owners who take the risk to make a better future for themselves, the large businesses & corporations that invest hundreds of billions of dollars back into the economy.",1,1,1444702882,1444721258
