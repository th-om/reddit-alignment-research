We might have had a democratic governor speak but I can't remember.  I think there might have been some booing when Ron Paul spoke.  Politics can be really heated at LU (and everywhere I guess) so I was nervous that there would be some booing (especially with like 10,000 college students in the crowd).  I think the average Liberty student would have liked hearing Sanders' position.",7,0,1442431331,1444727835
