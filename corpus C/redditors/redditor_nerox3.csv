The old railway bridge to the west over Robertson is part of the Trans-Canada trail and also part of the [Rideau Trail](http://www.rideautrail.org/maps/Map18.pdf).  That will connect you to a good amount of trail network to explore in the Stony Swamp area.  

Another area that is accessible is The South March Highlands.  Take the 93 to the Richcraft Rec Centre in Kanata and head north west to cross Terry Fox. There are a good number of trails there.  I haven't been there in a couple of years but last time I went the outback trail was a nice hike.       ",2,0,1444611308,1444717874
cvvit7i,0,t1_cvvhszj,nerox3,The river can be a mile wide at that point.  But before the river it has to cross the delta bottom lands  which are relatively treeless and what river corridors there are tend to be north south. Then there is the highway.  It could happen but there isn't an obvious natural corridor for them to travel through.  ,0,0,1444537801,1444717874

However, I'm much more disgusted by the crass and deliberate use by the Conservatives of this  appeal to xenophobia/islamophobia to try and win an election.       ",1,0,1444514337,1444717874
cvv37rf,0,t1_cvuzn74,nerox3,They aren't that discreet. If there was a healthy population in Tennessee the evidence would be there. A hunter would have treed one.  There would have been road kill. There would be good photographs. There would be prints found.  I think it is quite likely this is a released pet considering the distance and barriers it would have to cross to reach Tennessee.  I expect one day there will be a breeding population in eastern North America but  I think it will be found in Northern Ontario first.    ,17,0,1444508308,1444717874

> The two are functionally equivalent, the Bank loses profits in either case in exchange for public infrastructure. Which is exactly what you were talking about originally.

Describing the large water storage vessel and the water inside as ""public infrastructure"" when it is only used to put out a fire in that kitchen is really stretching the language.  Would you call the smoke detector that I am required to have ""public infrastructure""?   How about the car insurance I am required to purchase?  ",1,0,1444251913,1444717874

There is already some grit in the system,  but I suspect for some people the attraction of the tax is the added grit reduces the incentive to treat the stock market like a low vig casino.     ",7,0,1444238970,1444717874
