cvxp3r7,1,t3_3ogthl,Dire88,"22, apx $50k/yr, $100 at a department store. Silver with a small diamond. We eloped a week later and that was her wedding ring until I could afford a nice white gold and diamond bridal set .  
  
She still wears the silver ring everyday, with the gold ones only coming out for parties/events/etc.  
  
Being preoccupied with the price of the ring instead of the gesture of receiving it is, in my opinion, a surefire sign that you may want to reconsider your proposal.",1,0,1444702680,1444726192

You joined one, of your own free will. If you didn't research what membership entails it's your own fault. If you did, then you realize the benefit being in one has for your home's resell value.  
  
In my opinion HOAs suck. But if you can afford a home in one, you can afford a home that isn't in one and that you can do whatever you want to. Nobody held a gun to your head - grow up.",-5,0,1444690723,1444726192
cvwi1t9,0,t1_cvp5zpl,Dire88,"Wow, the answer to your question is actually pretty interesting when you look into it, and take into consideration how much captured equipment was used by the Germans.    
  
The American military's (and I'm assuming the rest of NATO) current policy is to destroy equipment in the event of being left behind during a retreat or if the unit/equipment faces capture. The methods used for different weapon systems are outlined in the Technical Manual for the piece of equipment (these are issued with every piece of military equipment, essentially an instruction manual). Instructions vary by platform, but generally the bolt, and barrel are in some way destroyed so as to make the weapon inoperable.  
  
Knowing the current policy, I took a look at some older US Army TMs for individual weapons that were published either before or shortly after the war began. None of these manuals makes any mention of destroying equipment, or the situations in which it would be permitted. So it's safe to say this was not a readily accepted policy, thought doubtlessly some commanders on the ground would make such a decision if needed.  
  
BUT, here is the interesting part. After the war commenced (looks like about 1943), subsequent issues of TMs specifically contained a section describing the weapons destruction, training soldiers to do so, and what criteria the command should consider before ordering it be done. Here's an excerpt from FM23-10 (Published Sept 1943) for the M1903 Rifle:  
  
>IN EVENT OF IMMINENT CAPTURE IN COMBAT ZONE.  
>a.The decision to destroy ordnance matériel to prevent its 
>capture and use by the enemy is a command decision and will be 
>ordered and carried out only on authority delegated by the 
>division or higher commander.  
>b. Principles governing destruction.-The following are the 
>fundamental principles to be observed in the execution of an order 
>to destroy small arms:  
>(1) The destruction must be as complete as the circumstances will permit.  
>(2) Lacking time for complete destruction, the parts essential to operation of the weapon must be destroyed, beginningwith those parts most difficult of duplication by the enemy.  
>(3) The same essential parts of each weapon must be destroyed to prevent the reconstruction of a complete weapon from several damaged ones.  
>c. Training.-The training of individuals before they reach
>the combat zone will be such as to insure their ability to destroy quickly and adequately the weapon(s) with which they are 
>armed in an established and uniform sequence based on the principles stated in b above.   
>Training will not involve the actual destruction of matériel.  
  
The manual prior to this (Published 2 January 1940) makes no mention whatsoever of destroying equipment. Considering that the M1903 had been in [limited] usage during WW1, if the capture of equipment had been a concern this would have likely made it into the 1940 manual, as well as earlier ones.  
  
I found the same difference in the TMs for the M1 (FM23-5 dated 1940, and 1950), and the M1918A2 Browning (FM 23-15 dated 1940, and 1943). I also recall mention being in a TM for the M2 Browning that was dated in the mid to late 1940s. I would feel confident in saying this denotes a changing trend in the Army's thoughts in regards to individual weapons being captured and reused by enemy forces.  
  
If you're interested in reading the TMs yourself, or taking a look at some Field Manuals from the time period, this site has a pretty good listing in PDF format: http://www.90thidpg.us/Reference/Manuals/  
  
As far as the second part of your question, booby trapping an individual weapon tends to be a time consuming job' time that could be wisely spent elsewhere in the event of leaving equipment behind. Not to say it isn't possible that it happened, but that it would not have been official military policy and was likely a rare event.  
  
But, at the risk of hitting on current events, I have heard one account of a weapon cache in Iraq being found, rifles having their handguards removed, holes being drilled in the barrels, and the handguards being replaced to cover it up. These weapons were then returned to the cache in hopes of injuring those who attempted to use them. I can't confirm it, but rumors usually have a basis.

But I will leave you with an excerpt from *The Sharp End* by John Ellis in regards to Allied usage of amphetamines.  
  
""[For the British] Rum was the favored stimulant for front-line troops. Similar needs for those further back were not ignored however, and many rear-echelon troops with demanding jobs, especially those who sometimes had to work days and nights at a stretch, were issued with liberal quantities of amphetamines. The Germans were the first to issue them in large quantities to their troops but the British soon followed suit. A paper by Brigadier Q. V. B. Wallace, the DDMS of X Armoured Corps, records:  
  'Pep' tablets, i.e. benzedrine tablets, were used for the first time in the Middle East on a large scale. 20,000 tablets were issued to the A.D.M.S. of each division . . . who was responsible for their distribution and safe custody. The initial dose was 1.5 tablets two hours before the maximum benefit was required, followed six hours later by another tablet, with a further and final tablet for another six hours, if required . . . I consider that 'Pep' tablets may be very useful in certain cases, particularly where long-continued work is required over extended periods, i.e. staff officers, signallers, lorry drivers, transport workers, etc. The tablet must only be used when an extreme state of tiredness has been reached. The tablets have practically no ill-effects, and an ordinary night's sleep restores the individual to his original working capacity.""  
  
He goes on to quote a Canadian Armour sergeant: ""We had been awake for forty-eight hours, fatigue-laden hours; all seasickness had disappeared, but the men were still weak from it; we had been issued ""bennies"" to keep awake, and the haggard look that gave the men made us appear like zombies.""
