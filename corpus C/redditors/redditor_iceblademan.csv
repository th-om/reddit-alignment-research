cvvvjde,0,t1_cvvmyor,iceblademan,"They're already here and they aren't going anywhere. The CBO estimated this year that it would take 300 Billion dollars and 40 years to deport all illegals. You tell me how you would frame that discussion with the American people. 

You mention the visa process. Ours is a shitshow. In some cases it takes a DECADE to get your paperwork approved. I dated a girl once whose father was involved in this process. After 3 years of waiting, he hired a lawyer threatened legal action and only then was his case fast-tracked. It might be better for people like you to imagine cases in which these people take on immense personal and financial risk to get here. There is a compelling reason they undertake that process and not the legal route. 

They're also clogging up our emergency rooms. You'd think that it would make sense to the ""fiscal responsibility"" crowd to give these children basic medicare insurance and get them out of the socialized part of our system and into managed healthcare where the parents are responsible for copays, prescriptions, etc. 

The rest of your comment is total conservative nonsense, but I hope that answers your basic questions. ",1,0,1444578624,1444721336
