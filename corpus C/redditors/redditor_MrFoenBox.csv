A while back I had a similar problem and didn't care what people thought until I had too;which is when I had to start networking. Long story short I had to force-reward/incentivise myself into turning everything into a question and get what I want from there. 

Every manipulator knows he won't get far without getting legit help OR like you said manipulating help out of someone. So show him that he needs help otherwise he won't be able to communicate with you. Tell him you don't understand. Explain why you can't go barking orders anymore. By not talking to him or just arguing you risk pushing him further away and ensuring every time you do talk there will be a fight. 

----------------------

If he IS NOT telling the truth, that means you too deep down the rabbit hole and you need to climb yourself back out. That means you need to prove to him that you are not ""some pushover human being"", rather that you are a challenge. If you are a challenge that means every time he could bark orders at you he will have to expend more mental energy than most simply forcing you to back down. 

At this stage I suggest bargaining with him. It's every megalomaniacs dream to have AND know everything, so show him that you have some value. Make sure that only you have what he wants and he is going to have to give something up to get it. 

For (an extreme) example: You could kick him out. Tell him if he doesn't stop acting like a premadonna that he can't stay there. Due to self interest he might want to work with you. 

----------------
Hope this helps! 

TL;DR: if he doesn't know how to communicate, help him to by showing that he needs to in order to continue having ""power"" so to speak. Don't shun him, it will only make it worse. If he is manipulating you, show him you ain't no push over and bargain with him. In other words get on his level.

cvpfc1e,0,t1_cvott2s,MrFoenBox,"No, obviously Walmart follows regulations that's common sense. I am referring to loopholes in human judgement. Due to lapses in judgment, bias, and just general mistakes i don't trust the current system where the decision of who can have a gun or not could very well come down to the Walmart salesman or the instructor that day during classes.

cvodc2a,0,t1_cvob325,MrFoenBox,"I think I am for universal gun law as well, but with the qualifier that we can accurately judge character and mental state. It's very easy to lie to someone, instructor or not. Plus a Walmart salesman may not necessarily care, nor do I want to trust the honour system when lives hang in the balance. There needs to be no loopholes before I can fully back this kind of stuff. ",1,0,1444003035,1444727962
cvo8dhs,0,t1_cvo5t3k,MrFoenBox,"There are two problems I have with these theory's. 

1) A student could still go buy guns at Walmart regulations or not. 

2) Training and fee's withstanding, how can the system efficiently and properly judge the gun owners intent for the purchase of a gun and his/her mental state of mind?

cvel5hg,1,t3_3me74b,MrFoenBox,"Pencils, and other assortments was my gig. This was in grammar school and no one really used mechanical pencils until I started selling them. Made a fair profit doing the same for selling lead, ink for certain pens, and erasers.  I even charged a couple cents for quick ""repairs"" as sometimes the lead would get stuck and no one knew how to get it out. 

After awhile teachers caught on and started underselling me or just plain handing them out and I went out of business. To this day I can unclog a pencil and replace it with a full stock of lead in under 30 seconds with a new eraser and a small grip if you so choose. For some reason I get an adrenaline rush doing that. Go figure...",1,0,1443247816,1444727962
cvecn15,1,t3_3mej8n,MrFoenBox,"1) Trust me only the geniuses of this OpenTTD can understand **ALL* the train signals(as there are several types). However if you would like to take a crack at it here is the [wiki thread] (https://wiki.openttd.org/Signals) for it. Basically the long and short of it is if you want multiple trains on multiple lines you will need these. This is great for inter-town systems and essential for any large one. If you feel over whelmed my suggestion is get a handle on the block signals first and don't be afraid to ask questions! :) 

2) Yes, transportation of goods/passengers/mail for a town or city is the only way to make it grow. The bigger the city, the bigger the system, the more cash you make. Connecting towns doubles your profit, and allows easy transportation of anything between the towns.

cve8fvg,0,t1_cve2n51,MrFoenBox,"Some common phrases' history are unimportant or so long they deserve a Wikipedia page. So don't worry about all of them just look out for the ones that might be offensive because their history is a painful one (like curse words). 

Since phrases usually have their own history most people simply ignore them and slowly pick up the phrases as they talk with other people in society. This is why it is usually picked up during childhood, because if you spend 7+ hours per day in school (please adjust for different countries as I am in The USA), most of that time is spent talking with either a teacher or your friends. 

The best remedy I can suggest is practice makes perfect. As you talk to more people, try and notice what they are saying and look up the meaning. If you like it (and is not offensive) use it to your own advantage.

Hope this helps and thanks for asking questions! The world needs more questions to get answers. ",8,0,1443218898,1444727962
