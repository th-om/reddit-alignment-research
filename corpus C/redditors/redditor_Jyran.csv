cvuip2k,0,t1_cvufyw7,Jyran,"Yea let me  rephrase.

My argument is that slavery was not only just the  spark, but the primary fuel by far as well. States rights was just the political mechanism that facilitated the dispute. At its core though, the issue was slavery and not the mechanism itself. ",1,0,1444451473,1444728918
cvuf9dy,0,t1_cvub25d,Jyran,"And yet no one is going to war over it...  I just think if it was that important we maybe would have seen them mention it in their declarations if secession?

In regards to the nullification crisis, it can be argued that South Carolina got a good deal out of the whole debacle. 20 years later the question is no longer taxation, but slaves. So yes its a question of states rights, but its still central to slavery. It was an issue that half the country felt like it was worth fighting for. We don't see the same passion in the nullification crisis to secede over taxes. ",1,0,1444443481,1444728918
cvuau4n,0,t1_cvua6xn,Jyran,"The problem I have with that is we don't really see that in history. The southern states don't mention taxation, or states rights in their list of grievances when they seceded. If that stuff was driving the fuel behind the movement, why don't we see the states formally complaining about it?

In regard to taxes, southern states were actually experiences some of the lowest tax rates in fifty years by the time of the start of the war. 

States rights, is very ambiguous to start with. When South Carolina seceded, they did so because the federal government essential upheld a northern states' decision to not have slaves. 

Perhaps I'm wrong and am just missing something. But nothing at the time really seems like enough of a motive to go to war over other than what was happening with slavery. ",1,0,1444434620,1444728918

cvtt7gy,0,t1_cvtsme4,Jyran,"I think Mississippi would disagree with you, 

""Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. 

These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. 

There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.""


So yea, they were pretty sure that slavery was good economics. [Source](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_missec.asp)",3,0,1444406643,1444728918
