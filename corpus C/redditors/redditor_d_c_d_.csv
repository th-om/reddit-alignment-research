cvvyqm6,0,t1_cvvxe5e,d_c_d_,"Just off the top of my head, I see a few errors…

> “I ask, Sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people except for a few politicians.” – George Mason, co-author of the 2nd Amendment.

The actual quote is:

> Who are the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a few public officers. *But I cannot say who will be the militia of the future day. If that paper on the table [the Constitution] gets no alteration, the militia of the future day may not consist of all classes, high and low, and rich and poor.*

Then there is  this…

> “Firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself. They are the American people’s liberty teeth and keystone under independence.”

This quote first appeared in the '90s and there is no record of George Washington ever actually saying it, sorry it would have been a good one - but unfortunately General Washington had far more quotes discouraging untrained civilians with guns.

> “I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery.” – Thomas Jefferson.

Jefferson actually said: ""*Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem*"" - which more accurately translates to ""*I prefer the tumult of liberty to the quiet of servitude*.""

> “A free people ought to be armed.” – George Washington.

The actual quote is: *A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined; to which end, a uniform and well digested plan is requisite: and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories, as tend to render them independent on others for essential, particularly for military supplies.*",5,0,1444584332,1444720381
