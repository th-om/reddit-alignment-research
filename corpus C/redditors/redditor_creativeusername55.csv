cv4bopb,0,t1_cv4bcuc,creativeusername55,"I agree with you it should have never happened and that he should have never been arrested (it surely was a traumatic experience). I think more than an apology is due. But my question is, again, where was the engineering teacher to defend him? Was it not a project inspired by his class as he was asking for help from his teacher? If he had said something/ was initially contacted all of this could have been avoided. I am trying to make sense of this as much as possible because the instant I saw it, I could tell it was a harmless project, but what about to someone who has no experience in the field/ someone unaware of the basics of how technology works. (I am in no way saying the teacher was right, she was wrong. The school did handle it extremely poorly. I am saying it is possible she has no clue when it comes to anything involving engineering and is extremely naive in that area.) ",1,0,1442460678,1444728722
cv4b7vu,0,t1_cv482y0,creativeusername55,"I am sorry, but I have to disagree with you. When I was in college, I once was working on an engineering project and was working on it in the library and this was at a major university - a place with a plethora of engineering students/ students working on projects like his for fun (usually we only worked on them in the engineering lab/ designated spaces). On my way out, I put it all in a box - it was overflowing and many wires were sticking out. I was asked on two different occasions what I was doing, what it was, and why I was walking around with it. Just because you and me might know what circuit boards look like/ how to tell the difference, does not mean everyone knows especially a high school English teacher. Go watch a movie that involves a bomb and see if you could find any possible similarity between the photo and a Hollywood bomb. And quite frankly, even though he should have never been arrested in the first place and I still feel the blame lies with his engineering teacher who failed to intervene/ stand up for him, this could possibly be one of the best thing that has ever/ will happen in his life: going to the white house, meeting with facebook, having tech companies behind him, people wanting him to have full scholarships - it looks like he is going to be given every and any chance to reach his great potential and more.

cv45f02,1,t3_3l6zwe,creativeusername55,"The facts as I see them:

To the untrained eye/ someone who does not know about or is not familiar with engineering, circuits, home built devices etc. the clock could easily be thought to have been a bomb. The English teacher was the reporting teacher. An English teacher is not expected to know about engineering, circuits, etc.


School shootings, bombs etc. are taken very seriously in this day and age. The phrase it is better to be safe than sorry is the sentiment among educators, principles etc.


The English teacher thought it looked like a bomb, she reacted as almost anyone would who thought something was dangerous and did not know any better.


Ahmed should not have been arrested. The bomb squad should have been called right away and they would have identified it was simply a clock. Where was the Engineering teacher in this situation? Why did the Engineering teacher not intervene when he was arrested and being interrogated? It seems that the Engineering teacher is more at fault than the English teacher who reported it.


Lastly, it is nevertheless traumatic for someone trying to do something positive, yet be punished. Apologies are in order, but the blow up and back lash could create a lot more problems. Educators/ others may now be less likely to report something they see as suspicious in fear of being reprimanded by the media/ world.

Edit: After reading more, and the fact that the school was not even evacuated and the English teacher placed it in her desk, if these two details are true then this was just senseless and cruel. I do still think the Engineering teacher should have done something to help. ",11,0,1442449620,1444728722
cv2p9a5,0,t1_cv2gvrs,creativeusername55,If you noticed I did not say below was any part of an argument. I said it said these are reasons to why I am split which is why I was asking for arguments from both sides. Yes I understand logical fallacies. I never said we can not help refugees because homeless veterans need help. My concern is our government failed a majority of these veterans and a lot of them do in fact need saving. The pro arguments other than the fact that we should help people in need is that the Syrian refugees with proper integration will be an asset to the US economy and the US as a whole. My problem is that the people who need saving in their own country of the US can also be those lifelines. I am a firm believer of fixing one's own problems ( and I will add problems closet to homes for the sake of a claim that I ignored that the US had a part in the Syrian crisis) before trying to fix other problems/ further away problems. ,1,0,1442346972,1444728722
cv2opn4,0,t1_cv2bl7p,creativeusername55,"I agree and understand that the US is made up of immigrants - my family is too. There is no doubt in my mind, especially with immigrants of the ww2 period, for example, that immigrants helped to make America greater in so many ways including Nobel prizes, advances, way of life etc. I am in no way saying that America should not accept immigrants, I think they should. I am saying that should America not step back and help those already here who need the help before admitting a possibly unstable refugee population that could contain potential threats to US itself. As it seems to be a consensus, there is a larger threat of terrorism/ riots/ problems with Syrian refugees compared to others. So should the US put the needs of its own first or the needs of others before its own. (Yes, I know the media perpetuates negativity, phobias etc; however, we also do not know when we are receiving a full 100% truth in this day and age. We live in a society where if we do not agree with the morally objective action of a Utopian society, we are automatically seen as terrible, hateful  and naive people - this I think is something that could be very dangerous.) If we looked at countries like families and a crisis happened - would you put others before your current family or put your own, current family, first?  (Please understand, I am trying to understand all sides and I do believe that helping people in need is most important especially when there is something that can be done to help them, but I believe we need to do it in the smartest possible way.

And yes Germany has said they will take 500,000 a year for every year that it is needed; however, even though a case study would prove very interesting and Germany would be a great focus for one, I am more concerned with current pro and con arguments as case studies require time to understand long term effects ",4,0,1442299103,1444728722
