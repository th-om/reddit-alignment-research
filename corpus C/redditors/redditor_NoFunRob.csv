cvx8egi,0,t1_cvx021x,NoFunRob,"I observe many more very loud & very ignorant non-conservatives.  I'm not saying that about all non-conservatives, though it seems to be especially prominent on Reddit.  This is the likely consequence of the Reddit age group as the saying goes: ""If you're young and not a liberal, you have no heart.  If you're older and not a conservative, you have no brain.""",0,0,1444677183,1444724353

cvw3uln,0,t1_cvhac06,NoFunRob,How do you propose to roll out thin sheets of choux pastry?  That would be impossible.,1,0,1444592211,1444724353
cvw1r0f,0,t1_cvm491q,NoFunRob,"You should add zero grams of the bread crumbs, and none of the egg white per pound of beef.  Just season with salt & pepper, then lightly fold it together.  If it's not adding a flavor that you're looking for, don't add it.  These extras that people add mean that the meat has to be mixed, and mixing works the light ground beef into a dense tough paste which cooks into dry concrete hockey puck burgers.",1,0,1444589059,1444724353

cvt41ah,0,t1_cvsbrhx,NoFunRob,"Sorry, not really, in the sense that it's not about the steel to me, so much as good simple easy maintenance.  I don't spend crazy artisanal time on sharpening my knives, I just steel them once a day, or every few hours under heavy use, and I might run them over a stone every few months.  I have cheap Henckels Internationals, and a couple nicer Henckels Twins.",1,0,1444348222,1444724353
cvs4qf2,0,t1_cvs31cd,NoFunRob,"I'm for old school German steel.  Couldn't make me use a Japanese high carbon knife for this reason:  I don't want to baby my knives when I'm busy.  I guess I do have to steel the edge more often, but that can be done quick-like.  Steel it when it's needed, and the edge is just as good as Japanese.",2,0,1444275677,1444724353
