cvt3xpe,1,t3_3nz561,Measure76,"I've been playing a lot of 1v1 ranked as a brand new player. Only after a week or two of playing have I been able to barely make it into bronze level matches.

This one game, this other guy is doing amazing trick shots against me constantly. Flying to the ball, I was clearly outmatched. Being new, I try to take this kind of thing as a learning experience. 

However, this guy starts texting at me during the match, ""I'm a new player, and I'm killing you bad. Plz uninstall"". ""Plz uninstall"". 

Now, I have no idea why someone that good was matched up with someone like me, but that whole match he was berating me with messages indicating I should quit even trying to get better at the game, that I should uninstall and never play again.

I get it, there's trolls in the game, but I saw no clear way to report him. The most I could do was fight through to the bitter end of that match, in a lame attempt to show he wasn't intimidating me.",2,0,1444348048,1444726890
