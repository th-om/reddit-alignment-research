cvxccor,0,t1_cvxbg55,Bizoza9,"No, I'm going to be upset that they are breaking the law, yet people here think that this guy passing on the left would get what he deserves if he were to have gotten into a wreck. It's a double standard, and it needs to stop. The more people here in reddit realise that you are not supposed to be in the left lane unless you are passing, the better the chances that the roads will be safer for everyone. Those cruising in the left lane are the ones manufacturing people like the guy in the video. He in turn is making others lives unsafe. It's a cycle, one which is easy to break by simply following the laws, such as don't cruise the left lane, and don't pass on the right. Both are guilty of violating traffic laws.",0,0,1444682792,1444717017

cvx2djd,0,t1_cvx1415,Bizoza9,"I don't, and that's why I don't support the laws allowing abortion. A woman's right to chose infringes upon the right to live by another person. I gave you an example of legislation that shows an unborn fetus as human, which is what you disputed. The reality is that it isnt cut and dry like the narrative you want to push. Even my own anti-abortion ideals have a stipulation of the mother's life being in clear and realistic danger being a point where I waiver. You push things like women's rights over a right to life, and that scares me because it becomes a gender inequality situation where a woman's rights is more important than human life.",2,0,1444668391,1444717017

cvx0u9q,0,t1_cvx0i4e,Bizoza9,"It's already in legislation. If you kill a pregnant woman, you can be charged with the murder of the unborn child. How do you feel about that? Since it's not even a human to you, you can't uphold that idea.",6,0,1444665984,1444717017
cvx01in,0,t1_cvwx2is,Bizoza9,"Now we just need something to shove left lane cruisers off the road and into a ditch filled with pointy sticks. That would be the final solution to the whole problem.

Edit: Figures, a bunch of left lane cruisers trying to monopolize the lanes would come in here and act like rules don't matter yet again.",-12,0,1444664707,1444717017
cvwfgn5,0,t1_cvwemg5,Bizoza9,"I do get what you are saying, but I think that while not all cops are bad, there is an underlying culture which not only accepts bad cops but actively encourages it. It's a culture that does create an us vs them mentality. I think it's also hard to see it in a negative light from inside the system. It's there for a reason, everyone has to watch one another's back, but that does come with a propensity to allow fellow officers to break and bend laws because you want to make sure that they have your back incase something happens. The problem comes when you find that at odds with the entire reason an officer is employed, which is to ensure the law is upheld.

Those officers who don't buy in are frequently the targets of some really nasty things, and many don't last long as officers. The others typically circle the wagons and that defense is actually what solidifies the mindset that all cops are bad. ",1,0,1444611766,1444717017
cvweg5w,0,t1_cvwe4zk,Bizoza9,"I should ask you the same thing about Alex Smith. It really starts to make me wonder when you are this adamant about him despite the fact that the season is a bust. You don't seem to care about anything in the team's future, you just want to see Alex Smith out there. You aren't his wife are you?",1,0,1444609861,1444717017
cvweagh,0,t1_cvwdten,Bizoza9,"And that's fine, but we need things that will help. Police and their unions stand directly in the way of those attempts. They specifically neuter any attempts at putting cameras on them, like in my city where there is no policy for when they are on. The history of ""lost"" footage means that we are unable to trust them with that authority. They neuter independent investigations with things like requiring a cop to be on the panel, or deciding that people who aren't particularly pro-cop are intelligible.

 Imagine if I set up a system where a rapist had to be there for every time a rapist was arrested. I could say ""well, the rapist knows how rape works, so we need them there"". Until officers allow oversight that is effective and enacts substantial change, the only option is people with cameras. I for one am damn glad that there is something out there advocating for those who are effectively powerless when it comes to police interactions.",2,0,1444609562,1444717017
cvwe27l,0,t1_cvwdpmd,Bizoza9,"Well, we have the option of what you are asking for. That is, we keep putting this subpar product on the field and expecting it to change somehow. I don't think that plays into the goal of winning so I'm at odds with how to parse your idea here.",1,0,1444609124,1444717017
