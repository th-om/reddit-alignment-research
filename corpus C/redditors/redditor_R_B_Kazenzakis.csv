No it wouldn't.

Nearly all the bombs would fall on enemy nuclear facilities and command and control facilities.  Russia has a declared total of 1500 deployed warheads, for instance.  With 500 silos in the US alone that's a thousand of the warheads being used right there.  Add another 150 for various air bases.  Then for command and control facilities.  Then conventional assets that can attack the other country(so, naval bases).  We've now used up a majority of the deployed warheads and haven't hit too many urban centers or agricultural regions other than the upper Midwest.  Note that we haven't even touched any overseas targets or Allied targets(France and UK both get hit as well).

It'll be the most cataclysmic event in written human history.  It wouldn't be ""the end of most life on earth"".",1,1,1444707756,1444716795

I was in a thread discussing firearms in /r/Europe and there were Europeans who legitimately thought that too.  There was an Austrian who said AR-15s in Europe were different than in America because American AR-15s are fully automatic.

Went to a wedding this weekend. Weddings, most gatherings really, are my personal hell. GF was the MoH so wasn't exactly something I could dodge.

I got a tire patched last week and the slow leak turned into ""a few days to go flat instead of everyday"". Am getting all 4 tires replaced today. Fortunately my GI Bill BAH and book stipend landed in my checking account on Friday.",7,0,1444662219,1444716795
