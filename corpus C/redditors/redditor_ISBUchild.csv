I couldn't work for three months even though the court ended up dismissing the ticket. There were six weeks worth of waiting just for a letter from one entity to go to another entity to inform them of my innocence. It was a harrowing experience which made me see the justice system completely differently.

The nearest bus stop, according to Google Maps, is a half hour walking distance away, at which point it takes about two hours to get across town, and only during the day when the buses are running.

We can say driving is legally a privilege, but it's a necessity to participate in the economy for most Americans. People who drive without insurance should be punished, but they should be punished in a way that doesn't make it impossible for them to get that insurance if they are acting in good faith. After my experience with the legal system, which cost me thousands and months of my life over a no-insurance ticket in which *I was proved innocent*, I'd almost prefer jail time to the snowballing fines.",1,0,1444541723,1444716721

The punishment should be fair. The punishment for not being able to pay a fine should not be still more fines, and less income-earning ability.

You're exactly right; I paid the original ticket fine the court told me, and thought all was well. Turns out they assess surcharges months later.

The set of people that could be in this situation encompasses literally everyone.

Second, it is impossible to comply with the rules or avoid tickets 100%. Nobody knows all the rules, which are so numerous that the government has stopped even being able to count them at all. Some rules are not explicit, and subject to interpretation by the bureaucracy. Police officers can err in applying the rules, or lie about them, which then costs you time and money to contest, which not everyone can do. A person trying to do the right thing will inevitably be in a situation where a ticket can be imposed; It's only a question of whether the dice-roll of the universe decides to give you one that day.

Third, punishment should be proportionate, and feasible for a person to comply with in good faith. Compounding fines become disproportionate punishment very fast, like ruin-your-career-and-life bad.

Here's my experience, as someone who was cleared by the court on all violations, and still got my life completely destabilized:

- Early 2013, my auto insurance renews automatically.

- A week later, someone rear-ends me while merging, in an accident for which I am found not at fault. While handling the paperwork with the police, they tell me that their computer system says my insurance coverage ended a week ago, and unfortunately they must write me a ticket for failure to maintain financial responsibility.

- Being a middle-class person with a busy job, I look at the fees the court says apply to this offense (~$300) and decide it isn't worth taking off work over. I pay with Visa and the court says I'm squared away.

- Unknown to me, this particular ticket, unlike others I have paid in the past, comes with a separate set of surcharges, which are assessed by a different part of the government. These fees are set to be applied *six months after the offense*, presumably just as an extra ""shame on you"" by the state. In theory, I should be expected to know all fees and penalties for every offense for all levels of government in every jurisdiction in which I drive, but let's not kid ourselves here.

- These charges go into default soon after they are applied. Extra fees are applied for not paying the surcharges.

- In Jan 2014, unpaid surcharges trigger an automatic one-year suspension of my driver's license. I later found out a notice would have been mailed, but I never got it. I was sharing an address at the time and so can't say where the error was.

- Still not knowing anything has happened, I drive all around the state for work over the next year. In two separate encounters with police during this time, I hand over my license, and am not told anything of this.

- A computer somewhere *did* notice, and automatically triggered a one-year continuation of my suspension for driving with a suspended license, somewhere around the turn of 2015.

- In Feb 2015, I am fired from my job on the spot for refusing to illegally work overtime without being paid. I spend the following day getting my affairs in order, including buying a different car insurance policy. It is in this moment that I learn for the first time that my license was suspended.

- I have an emergency fund, but can't work without my car. I spend money to hire a lawyer, and get a signed letter from my former insurer attesting that I was covered at the moment of the original ticket.

- I create a flowchart of the legal fight ahead to get back on the road. There are many steps, all of them them interdependent, costing money, and taking weeks or months to schedule.

- Immediately, a motion is filed to vacate my former plea on the ticket with the new evidence. I also request a hearing on the matter of my suspension.

- Weeks pass, but the court eventually sides with me and the case is reversed. Now, they need to convey this information to the agency that assessed the surcharges, so they can be removed.

- I am told it will take six weeks to get a hearing for my suspension.

- Weeks pass. My minimum monthly living expense is about ~$2000, as well as legal costs. I learn later that the letter from the municipal court informing the state of my innocence was lost by the receiving agency.

- I get my suspension hearing, which is a brief affair. My attorney shows the judge my overturned case, but the judge regrets that he cannot act on the city's PDFs, and must wait for the physical letter to reach the state, which hasn't gone through, even a month after the case was resolved. The judge reschedules the hearing, which will take another month.

- My attorney fights with the bureaucracy to fit Tab A into Slot B with the status of my case.

- Weeks pass. The state finally gets whatever letter it needed to dismiss all surcharges against me.

- Weeks pass. The hearing judge eventually gets to look at my situation again, and seeing the case cleared and the charges waived, decides to reinstate my license and cancel the extension. Mind you, he was not obligated to do this; I could still have been suspended for having driven with a suspended license, even one I didn't know was suspended and for which the original case was dismissed.

- Weeks pass. Eventually, my status in whatever computer system is finally changed, and the insurance companies are no longer told I am suspended. I get insured and back to work.

- Weeks pass. The city refunds my original ticket.

All told, this experience took over three months to resolve. I lost ~$8000, my entire savings buffer, during this period of unemployment and with legal expenses. This is all for a misunderstanding in which *I was cleared of all violations*, with the only mistake on my part being ignorance of the law when deciding to plead no contest to the original ticket.

I am a fortunate person. I made almost exactly the median American income at the time. I was in a position to have months of living expenses saved in preparation for something like this to happen. My family gave me occasional rides to buy needed groceries and get to court.

What would this look like for someone less fortunate? As I found out during those three months, the closest bus stop to my apartment is a half-hour walking distance away. Being without a car, and without a ride from someone else, is basically like being kicked out of the entire economy. What about someone who didn't have money ready to pay hundreds of dollars for a lawyer? They are in a dead end.

People lose the jobs they can't show up to, and then have no money to pay the fines that keep them from working, which results in still more fines. It costs $300 to fight off a fine of $900. How is that a fair situation for anyone, even someone who did speed, or roll through a stop sign, or such-like? It is a system that makes it very expensive to be poor, a Damocles sword that stands to crush their finances and get them thrown out of their homes or jailed almost randomly, with little hope of escape.",2,0,1444540328,1444716721
