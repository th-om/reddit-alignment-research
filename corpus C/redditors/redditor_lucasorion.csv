cvsdeat,0,t1_cvri4sm,lucasorion,"Exactly. I remember finding out that my uncle would have been in one of the towers if he hadn't been on vacation with his wife that week. I brought that up numerous times when the topic of 9/11 came up (especially that year), just for some kind of ""I have a connection to this huge, horrible event"" effect, I guess. I think there's something psychological there, when this happened a lot of people wanted to have some sort of connection to it. I don't know if it's a coping mechanism or something, but I think this guy's attempt at being connected - escalated during that initial birth of the lie to impress his acquaintances - was a moment of weakness that spiraled into years of a growing burden, culminating in this 'scandal'.",1,0,1444305245,1444722403

cvm71g1,0,t1_cvlxurd,lucasorion,"I think people just lump them in with Fox because they clearly have a political leaning, and issues that they want to focus on beyond the typical daily news cycle topics (like the environment with Hayes, and gay rights/reproductive rights with Maddow) - but whether they actually are demagogic liars and play fast and loose with facts, that isn't something people actually provide evidence for while they make false equivalencies.",-1,0,1443824431,1444722403
