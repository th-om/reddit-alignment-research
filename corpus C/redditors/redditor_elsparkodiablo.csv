cvxgj1t,0,t1_cvxgdxz,elsparkodiablo,"Here, allow me to give you some simple math.

NICS stats show there are around 20 million firearms purchased a year through dealers.  If 20% of them are first time buyers, how many new gun owners are there?    If that trend continues year after year (it does), how many new gun owners are there each year?  If there are 100 million firearms owning households, and 20% of gun purchasers in a year are new gun buyers, how many new gun buyers are there over a decade?

I'm curious what your thoughts are for the gun industry declaring Barack Obama gun salesman of the year for almost a decade now?

> Small upswing in a small time period, not mutually exclusive with the long term trend that shows a declining number of households with firearms

I'm curious, what do you think happened in the 1994 time frame that caused self reported ownership to drop so precipitously?",1,0,1444689101,1444718114
cvxfsm8,0,t1_cvxcyzv,elsparkodiablo,"> That's because Gallup has a 95% confidence interval with a 4% error. Polling is expected to fluctuate like that. Individual points are going to fluctuate with noise, but you can still determine an overall trend in the data, even with that noise.

Yeah and the trend has been largely flat since the 90s, and if anything ownership is underreported because fuck telling a complete stranger whether I own a gun.

Also covered in the NSSF surveys.

> I'd like to see the relationship between target shooting and gun ownership.

Nearly 100% of target shooters own guns.  But anecdotally, .22lr is the most prevalent round used for target shooting and despite bumping up production capabilities and raising prices, there's been a nationwide shortage since 2013.  This is due in part to panic buying and people just enjoy shooting their new guns.

http://bearingarms.com/22lr-ammo-drought-end/ is just an example but the shortage is very well known in the firearms community.

> So... you're saying two polls that both show downward trends don't show a downward trend? 

Define ""trend"" because it's been relatively flat for the last few decades.

> It's entirely possible that the different polling methods create different biases.

Or that there's a confounding variable such as not trusting strangers.  

> But, you know, you can't discredit both polls using the other, because at most we can only determine that one is wrong (unless we have more data and can prove that data is more correct). And both show downward trends.

False dichotomy as it's possible that both are wrong and underreporting.  There's quite a few confounding variables not taken into account, such as ""fuck telling a stranger that I own a gun"" - let's face it, like you said trust in the government isn't great.  Personally I that after being told for over a decade that gun control is a dead issue and nobody's wanting to ban guns, I can laugh in the face of anyone making that claim in the future. :)",1,0,1444687948,1444718114

> 1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2–53.

> (a) The Amendment’s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause’s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2–22.

> (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court’s interpretation of the operative clause. The “militia” comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens’ militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens’ militia would be preserved. Pp. 22–28.

> (c) The Court’s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment . Pp. 28–30.

> (d) The Second Amendment ’s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30–32.

> (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court’s conclusion. Pp. 32–47.

> (f) None of the Court’s precedents forecloses the Court’s interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542 , nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252 , refutes the individual-rights interpretation. United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174 , does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.

Nope. It's not.  And it's stupid on top of that because existing firearms crimes aren't being prosecuted; nobody is going to push a case over ammo.  Especially since you can cast your own bullets fairly easily.

See, here's the problem bud - you don't have even a layman's grasp of the subject.  You are making statements really similar to Akin's ""legitimate rape"" ones.
