cvvmx1e,1,t3_3nuhln,PandaLover42,"I'm confused, what specifically was wrong with the McCain interview? The first half was hilarious, and when they got down to some serious issues, Colbert was able to expose the absurdity of sending more troops to the Middle East while McCain listed some vague rhetoric about why the Iran nuclear deal was bad.",2,0,1444550149,1444726780
cvvm6v4,1,t3_3o9c1q,PandaLover42,"I'm confused. You want more variety, but you don't like how the interviews are separated by another segment?

I like that format, much better than the other late night shows that have two consecutive interviews followed by a performance.",4,0,1444547310,1444726780
cvvgec6,1,t3_3o9mk8,PandaLover42,"Absolutely. I was kinda shocked to see all the negativity over in /r/television toward the show today. But I absolutely love this show. And we get to have more than double the content per week compared to The Colbert Report! Jon hasn't been hilarious, but honestly, he's growing on me, too. And I'm appreciating the talent that the band brings more and more every day, which is a lot more important than comedy when it comes to the band, imo.",14,0,1444533119,1444726780
