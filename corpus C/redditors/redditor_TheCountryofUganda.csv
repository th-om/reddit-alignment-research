cvleog5,0,t1_cvld4bt,TheCountryofUganda,"I've read a couple of history books that don't touch on this. Do you have any specific ones in mind? 

Also what economics books touch on it well? 

Would you say you're objections could be said about the Paris Commune or Revolutionary Catalonia?

Edit: Also it seems like you don't want to talk. If that's the case you can simple say so. ",2,0,1443762216,1444721270

Let me know if that link doesn't work and to clarify pages 88 to 105 are missing. This leads to a good number of climbs at HCR not being in the book. The Grand Traverse at Sam's Throne is also one of the routes that's mislabeled.",1,0,1436145760,1444721270
