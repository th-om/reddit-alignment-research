I just hope it lands correctly in context (no pun intended). It looks like something that might take me out of the moment.",2,0,1444692326,1444718060
cvxbkhb,1,t3_3ohi02,Piratiko,"This reminds me of an employee I had once.

We were paying the guy something like $20 an hour for a job that probably wasn't worth that much, but he worked hard and as far as I'm concerned, he earned his salary.

He gets increasingly frustrated at seeing other people promoted with him being passed over. Problem is, the people getting promoted had degrees and qualifications that this guy didnt. The guy was smart and all that, but he had nothing to show for it outside a high school diploma.

Another thing I noticed is that he had a tendency to overcomplicate his own work. You'd give him a task that should take a few hours, and he'd spend a few days on it. Now, don't get me wrong, he was extremely thorough and it showed in the final product, but it wasn't efficient. 

Remember that movie Elf? Remember when Will Ferrell is asked to decorate the store for christmas, and he spends all night creating a display that would make a Lego Land executive blush? That's the type of stuff this guy would do. Think about how much time and money will Ferrell wasted in that movie.

This guy would overdo stuff like that, but even worse, he'd complain about how underappreciated he was and that he should be making more money, etc.

So he comes in one day and says he wants to be promoted and he wants a huge raise. I tell him we can do a formal review and go from there, but I can't make any promises.

He took this as me completely shutting him down.

Next day, he's a no-show. This is excusable if you call in and say you won't be at work, or even send an email. SOMETHING. But no, this guy just doesn't show up, doesn't call, just vanishes for a day.

And again, all he had to do was say ""I'm taking a personal day"" and we have no issue. I don't expect people to call me coughing and acting like they're sick. I get it. You need a day sometimes.

So he returns the following day with an air of smugness about him and asks if I've reconsidered. His whole no-call-no-show stunt was his way of reminding us how fucked we'd be if he wasn't there. He really felt like missing a day would have us all running around like headless chickens.

He's changed his proposal too. He wants an even bigger raise now, and he wants a manager title (even though he wouldn't be managing people, so he actually wants us to break the law and misclassify him as a manager).

I say no. He quits.

Hired a new person a week later, started them at a lower pay than he had, and they get all the work done in half the time. So it only took half a person to cover this guy's work.

Some people have a severely over inflated sense of their own self worth",43,0,1444681691,1444718060

cvu9zab,0,t1_cvu2vmw,Piratiko,"Here's what I don't get:

The fallback for all the fatpeoplehate folks is always ""being fat is unhealthy, and makes you a burden on society""

They frame it in such a way that they're concerned for the health of the individuals they're mocking, and they're doing it as sort of a ""tough love"" kinda thing.

Here's the thing though:

The chick in the gif is DOING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. She is burning calories! Sure, you can say that other workouts may be a better use of her time, but how far up other people's asses do you really need to be?

She is literally working toward not being fat in the gif, and people are still giving her shit.

So don't tell me this is all about public health. That's a line of bullshit, and this thread makes it very clear that' it's just people taking out their frustrations on people that they perceive to be beneath them. Fucking childish.",1,0,1444432993,1444718060
