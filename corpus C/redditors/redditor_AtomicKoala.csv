cvw94en,0,t1_cvvjxin,AtomicKoala,"...1/6th of EU citizens are German, so perhaps said citizen of us was German and was talking in a national context? Ireland is one of the most pro-TTIP countries given the fact we are so trade based, especially when it comes to US trade.

No need for the ""DAE fourth reich?"", argue against the treaty on its merits (or lack of).",1,0,1444600338,1444728396
cvw5u4s,0,t1_cvvwyth,AtomicKoala,"Now I think of it, you're right regarding Russia. Something still needs to be done however about them imo.",1,0,1444595103,1444728396
cvvuqk8,0,t1_cvvum6s,AtomicKoala,Well I'd be worried if someone living in the UK for a while didn't know about Churchill or Thatcher even if they never went to school in Europe. But he shouldn't be far below them in terms of common knowledge. Did you go to school in the UK?,1,0,1444577028,1444728396
cvvtd8i,0,t1_cvvptyy,AtomicKoala,"Mind you directly electing Senators doesn't make much sense either considering the point of the upper house is to elect states. They should really reflect the governing coalition of the state as in Germany, and the power of the Senate restricted to issues affecting state sovereignties and a few other things. Unfortunately there aren't governing majorities in the US... that's what a 200 year old unreformed constitution does for you I guess.",2,0,1444574086,1444728396
cvvs1ri,0,t1_cvvjefg,AtomicKoala,"France is still OP. In my Ottomans campaign I have both France and Muscovy under me, and the difference is astonishing. 

Muscovy had constant rebels, struggled to Westernise, has like 10 ideas and mil tech 14. France has 30 or so and mil tech 19, has a great navy that has landed in the Americas to help my wars, and never needs my aid.

So no, France is OP enough. Russia/Muscovy needs to be fixed. Eastern tech countries should be able to Westernise much more easily.",-2,0,1444570753,1444728396
cvvry5t,1,t3_3o8nm6,AtomicKoala,"I'm worse. Considering I was working fulltime over the summer when I bought it and I should be studying more medicine, it's slightly worrying that I'm finding so much time for it",3,0,1444570462,1444728396
cvvrtry,0,t1_cvvrr9a,AtomicKoala,God no. Having 10 3 dev provinces there is generous as is. The wasteland situation in the Americas is fine imo. I think Alaska should just be disbanded as a CN and given to California.,2,0,1444570092,1444728396
cvvrlw4,1,t3_3oasy1,AtomicKoala,"I love this event, adds historical flavour that's relevant to gameplay.",2,0,1444569441,1444728396
cvvqn05,0,t1_cvvb8u4,AtomicKoala,"Yeah. By the sounds of it (text stating name of state: complicated icon that is integral to the design), it should be terrible, but it works so well. One of the best US state flags, not that that is difficult.",1,0,1444566398,1444728396
