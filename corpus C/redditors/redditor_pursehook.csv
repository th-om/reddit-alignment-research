Also, you probably know this, but there is a huge, alarming rise in anti-semitism in France today. It is much different than say 10 years ago, and people are leaving and moving their financial assets to other countries.

cvwzgbt,0,t1_cvvsmi4,pursehook,"I had read about *The Naked City* being the first noir to use the city, documentary style, and how innovative that was.  So, I wanted to see it for that, but it really blew me away.
  
I lived in NYC for 10 years, so I had the extra pleasure of knowing some of those locations (107 used).  Loved it.  Especially that last scene on the Williamsburg Bridge, which I thought had to be the Brooklyn Bridge because the Williamsburg Bridge hasn't looked like that for a very long time.

cvwynxk,0,t1_cvwpjbh,pursehook,">I believe there are two different scorings.

Yes, but it is more than that.  There are two different movies.  I believe they had the same footage to work with but edited it and scored it differently.  This was because of some law or rights issue (maybe because of Dassin's blacklisted status), so it is an interesting case study.  

I haven't gotten the new blue-ray that has both versions, but I did watch the American one on TCM not too long ago.  Being TCM (a little educational) they showed a few scenes from the British version.  The ending is different, for example.  I preferred some of what I heard with the British sound treatment.  I think, for example, they might have used silence for a high-tension scene (will he be caught?) which completely changed the feeling from the American score which used the super-dramatic, high-tension music typical of noir.

I wouldn't just dismiss the British sound.  Some people might prefer it, but the American one is considered excellent.

Personally, I prefer *Rififi* and *The Naked City* (because of the innovative city shots).  *Night and the City* is excellent though; I think Widmark's character just isn't my personal favorite.

Wow, phew, because Rupert Penry-Jones' character has bad OCD, and I couldn't imagine how it could have been missed.  It is central to his character. He's scrubbing his hands all the time, needing to switch the lights on and off repeatedly, using some scented balm to help himself cope, etc.  ",1,0,1444616743,1444721613

I vaguely heard about that theory.  Give those 20 year olds the Oscar.  Is it a true A game if it doesn't get practiced?  I'm skeptical but not a football expert, at all.

I watched parts of the last two OSU games, and they just didn't look that great.  Thanks for commenting though!  We'll see.",2,0,1444615504,1444721613

Most of all, how Murray's life is destroyed in the first 10 or 15 minutes.  They were efficient at setting up the premise.  The whole movie is a bit much, but I'll watch that beginning anytime. :)",2,0,1444589704,1444721613

How does OSU not budge?

Edit:  Ok, I may hear a kindergarten teacher saying ""eyes on your own paper"" or ""hands to yourself"" or something similar.  May OSU be overconfident!!",6,0,1444587654,1444721613
