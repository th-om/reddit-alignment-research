cv4vjs9,0,t1_cv4hy5y,shekky,"Basically PP is operating a couple of legal (and ethical) gray areas. The law says the fetal tissue cannot be exchanged for ""valuable consideration"", and that ""reasonable costs"" associated with storage, shipping, etc can be obtained- but there's no specification as to what those amounts are. (Naturally, because they would be likely to vary). In these videos it appears that PP execs are looking to negotiate for high amounts, which suggests that they are not just looking at their costs and then providing what those amounts for reimbursement. 

The second issue from these videos is that technically physicians are not allowed to alter an abortion technique ""in a way that increases harm to the patient"", but they discuss the ways in which they are willing to change their techniques in order to keep specific parts of the fetus intact, if certain body parts are desired for orders. Again, a gray area for whether that could ""increase harm"" to the patients. 

In the most recent video, an exec talks about independent partners of PP who ""do very well"" with their reimbursement for fetal tissue. She talks of clinics who are not non-profit and cannot rely on donations for funding. Again, this insinuates that money is being made in addition to simply covering costs. None of the videos seem to prove anything concretely illegal, but rather highlight the way that PP  and other abortion clinics seem to be taking advantage of those legal gray areas.
