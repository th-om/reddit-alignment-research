cvwfcrj,1,t3_3oe4p5,AuthorizedWayne,"Well, your rivers/channels aren't how things would actually look.

You have what look like river deltas, with lots of channels and islands at one end of the 'rivers', but the other end of each river is *also* connected to the ocean. Do you want these to be saltwater ocean channels that happen to divide islands that are very close together, or do you want these to be rivers?",1,0,1444611559,1444721250

> A republic (from Latin: res publica) is a form of government or country in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law.

> Democracy, or democratic government, is ""a system of government in which all the people of a state or polity ... are involved in making decisions about its affairs, typically by voting to elect representatives to a parliament or similar assembly,"" as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary. Democracy is further defined as (a:) ""government by the people; especially : rule of the majority (b:) "" a government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodically held free elections.""",2,0,1444611213,1444721250
cvwdumb,0,t1_cvwcps3,AuthorizedWayne,"Overtime is changing not because 3v3 overtime is better than 4v4 overtime, but because it is better to decide a game via overtime than via shootout. 

3v3 sudden death overtime is supposed to be more likely to result in a goal scored than 4v4 sudden death overtime. Under the new system, more games tied at the end of regulation should end during 3v3 overtime (which is hockey, even if it is weird) instead of during a shootout (which isn't hockey).",1,0,1444608711,1444721250

cvqybzm,1,t3_3npln0,AuthorizedWayne,"> making sure the radius of the jammer only affects the interior of the car

This would be incredibly difficult. Any simple transmitter isn't going to have a car-shaped beam. 

To make matters worse, jammers would have an additive effect. In order to jam cell phones, you'll have to broadcast loud noise on [all of these frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_frequencies#United_States_Carrier_Frequency_Use).

Even if you set up your antennas in such a way that I can make a call while standing near one running car with a jammer, there will still be interference there. Put a few more cars nearby (like there usually are on a road), and you have a lot of sources of interference adding their transmitted noise power together. Even if the jamming outside a car is a quarter of what is needed to jam a cell phone, you wouldn't be able to make a call while standing on a sidewalk next to a busy road.",1,0,1444191554,1444721250
