Indeed. Instead of restricting ownership, let's make incentives for safe firearm ownership. Public safety classes.",1,1,1444716702,1444716767
cvxvxho,0,t1_cvxtu8k,The_Actual_Devil,"Would any of the restrictions proposed prevent the ownership of just those that intend to kill people? 

That is, if any of the proposed changes to law were to have been in place last year, would they have prevented just the people who committed mass murders from obtaining firearms, or would it also prevent people who had previously been able to legally purchase firearms from doing so?

>Yes, let's invest invest in autonomous vehicles on most roads.

So we should invest in better ways to prevent tragedies that doesn't involve banning the tools responsible for those tragedies? I agree completely.

>But more to the point, that analogy falls flat because it's entirely impractical to remove consumer vehicles in the USA because of how we've structured the country, but not at all for guns.

Why, exactly, is it impractical? It would be fairly easy to ban 2 ton murder machines from public roads. Far easier than a gun. 

Why should anyone give up a fundamental right to defend themselves to prevent deaths they aren't responsible for when society values convenient travel over the lives of ten fold the number of people killed by guns?

There are nearly as many **known** guns as people in the U.S., short of a magic gun magnet, the cat's out of the bag.

>But to make your analogy flip on itself, if we're going to treat guns like cars, let's make everyone get a license, training, require them to register and pay every year for what they own, and have stricter laws about injury caused by them.

Only to drive on a public road. Owning a car requires no license, registration, or insurance. You are free to own and drive anything you wish on your own property.

If, for example, it was decided that the death toll from passenger vehicles was too high to justify the personal use of cars and revoked that privilege for the entirety of the U.S.

Your attitude reinforces the belief that disarming law abiding citizens is the moral thing to do and adds to the echo chamber of knee jerk reactionaries.

>What about restricting gun ownership to those people in groups that have high risk of suicide?

The only reliable ways of weeding out suicidal people would be self reporting. Which would do nothing to stop them, they would just say that they aren't suicidal. There's no test for suicide, unfortunately.

You could also deny gun rights to people who have attempted suicide. But how far back do you go? Forever? What if someone found their will to live and now wishes to defend it? A teenager who attempted to kill themselves for attention during an emo phase, a decade later their ex is aggressively stalking them and making threats. Fuck their rights, they shouldn't be able to defend themselves and their family because they didn't understand the value of their life before, I guess?



>I personally think your right to defend yourself (with a gun) is a right that might need to be overruled to protect suicidal people, but I appreciate that's a larger question.

The right to defend yourself from harm should be overruled to prevent people who want to die from killing themselves but the privilege of convenient travel trumps the thousands of lives that are lost so people like you don't have to ride the bus?

>>I'd be much happier stopping a violent crime than a victimless suicide.

>A person who commits suicide who might have recovered in future is emphatically a victim.

Who's to say they will recover? Maybe they'll just find a manner of killing themselves that doesn't leave a smoking gun, alcohol, drugs, food, etc. 
Studies that show reduction in suicide in places with less firearms are entirely correlative. Japan has of the most restrictive firearm laws in the world also has one of the highest rates of suicide.

>>And again, removing access to knives and razor blades reduces suicide rates. Removing access to firearms reduces a person's ability to defend themselves from violent crime. Not so with other forms of suicide prevention.

>Except removing someone's access to sharp objects is impossible, as I said, and would be less effective at reducing suicide rates.

Unless someone invents a magic gun magnet, the same is true for firearms. Like it or not, Pandora's box has been opened. And the effectiveness of removing firearms to reduce suicide is not fact, it is a highly specious theory.

Removing passenger vehicles would be ten fold more effective at saving lives than removing firearms, and easier to enforce with the added benefit of not leaving people helpless against violent criminals.

cvwitmg,0,t1_cvwhwz9,The_Actual_Devil,">Well, doesn't mean there isn't a way.  Neither of us (I assume) are experts in this policy area.  Maybe it would require putting restrictions on everyone - I don't know.

If there was a way it would be being trumpeted from the rooftops. If you don't know, then why would you push for restrictions? I don't think prioritizing suicide prevention over defensive gun use is a moral decision.

>When I say cost/benefit, I mean in terms of utility - that is, actual human happiness.  So money isn't involved.

I'd be much happier stopping a violent crime than a victimless suicide.

>You think that restricting people's ability to move around would do less damage to their lives than the percentage likelihood of them committing suicide by car? 

There are a plethora of ways to travel, they're just less convenient. 

> Note that thousands of people aren't intentionally killing themselves every year with cars.

That makes it better?

>Why are you arguing as if the only value of a thing is your ability to defend yourself with it?  Do you not think things have uses beyond that?

Seems to me that you're making the same assumption about firearms.

>>Why does the method matter if the goal is to reduce deaths by suicide?

>I literally just explained why the method matters.  Again, I don't have a policy prescription here.  I'm telling you that removing access to firearms reduces suicide rates.

And again, removing access to knives and razor blades reduces suicide rates. Removing access to firearms reduces a person's ability to defend themselves from violent crime. Not so with other forms of suicide prevention.

cvwhejy,0,t1_cvwff7q,The_Actual_Devil,">First, I haven't actually said that I support removing all guns as a means of suicide prevention.

I don't see any way to remove firearms from people who may commit suicide without removing firearms from people who won't. 

>But it's really a cost-benefit analysis.  I think that in the case of cars, or painkillers (which, to be entirely fair, are already relatively controlled) or knives, the cost of restricting access outweighs the potential benefits.

It seems heartless to me that you value money over the lives of innocent people. Restricting the ownership of passenger vehicles would save thousands of lives at the cost of convenient travel. If you wouldn't give up the ***privilege*** of driving to save ten fold the amount of people killed by guns, why should I give up a ***right*** to protect myself from violent crime? There are thousands of examples of people defending themselves with firearms, while I can't seem to find many examples of the same being done with a car.

>Again, the reason why suicide prevention campaigns focus on guns is because a person trying to commit suicide is vastly more likely to complete the act using a gun as opposed to any other method.  Restricting access to guns would therefore have a much more significant effect on suicide rates than restricting other suicide techniques, and is arguably easier.

Why does the method matter if the goal is to reduce deaths by suicide? If there's no way to differentiate between a gun owner who may commit suicide and one who won't, what meaningful restrictions could be made besides a blanket ban? A blanket ban would cost lives of those who use guns as self defense to save people who wish to take their own lives.",1,0,1444615199,1444716767
