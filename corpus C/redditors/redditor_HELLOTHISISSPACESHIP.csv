cuh8wle,1,t3_3ikiok,HELLOTHISISSPACESHIP,"Political Correctness is a tool for controlling the discussion, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  There's a significant distinction between censorship and simply shouting down racists.  It is healthy for society (well-intentioned people in the aggregate) to steer public discourse in an inclusive direction.  If that sounds Orwellian, well it is, but...

...the other side does it at least as much.  ""Undocumented Workers"" and ""Illegal Immigrants"" are both technically true as labels, and both consciously ignore certain aspects of that classification. Either side has tried to brand this group of people as one or the other, in order to lure your sympathies in a particular direction, yet I fear the later has gotten greater traction with the electorate.  

At the end of the day these people are still people, and should probably be treated as such.  The more derogatory labels you throw in the direction of immigrants, the less people-ey they'll seem to be, and the more the immigrant-friendly community will want to push back.",-5,0,1440662115,1444719178

Left-wing economic populism has traditionally been the Democrats best bet for winning the (heavily overrepresented, and economically below-average) rural regions from where the Republicans have built their current majorities.

cuh8fd7,0,t1_cuh839w,HELLOTHISISSPACESHIP,"In no particular order:

1. Draft a straightforward money out of politics amendment.

2. Call up every sitting Democratic and Independent state legislator in the country, try to get them to campaign in support of said amendment.

3. Recruit the hell out of districts with Republicans or Dems who declined. Find the strongest possible local candidates and introduce them to his massive donor list.

4. Actually, probably create an online clearinghouse for donations, and later social media/phone calls/physical volunteering, for downballot candidates against money in politics.  Cut out the middleman, connect donors of time or money with the small town candidates desparate for both of those.

5. Try to get a conversation with Donald Trump.  He epitomizes the problem, but so far that has allowed him to critique the influence of money in politics more than most in his party, and he has a direct line to the ""fuck-the-establishment"" wing of the GOP.  Either he's in support, and the money out of politics amendment has that much more energy behind it, or he's opposed, and all the coursing Trump-hate on the left gets channelled into this cause.

6. Fund as many exposes as he can about corporate money influencing the way state legislatures vote.

7. Amplify the message of local candidates/activists/legislators fighting against money in politics as loudly and widely as possible.

How's that sound for the beginnings of a strategy?",0,0,1440660260,1444719178

Also, he shouldn't be running for awareness, that's slactivism at its most narcissistic.  Plenty of people are aware of this stuff, and have been for a while.  They've been soundly defeated repeatedly by those with better funding and organization.  He's in a perfect position to have a major impact on that, rather than fleshing out his ""Political Activist"" bulletpoint on his wiki page.",-2,0,1440657966,1444719178
