So one incident is ""extremely common""? ",1,0,1444695088,1444717720
cvxgzhs,0,t1_cvxgips,kubrick66,"Oh sure. But the Feds don't mess around. I think most federal buildings are secure anyway (metal detectors, etc). I was just saying to not try carrying into one of those places as they are some of the few buildings that actually are GFZ in Oregon. ",5,0,1444689833,1444717720

I mean you have to be getting your idea that this is a major problem from somewhere, so there should be tons of incidents out there right?",1,0,1444686929,1444717720

They aren't murderous psychopaths?  

Are you projecting something onto the rest of us with this analysis?",4,0,1444686191,1444717720
cvxei96,0,t1_cvxa0li,kubrick66,"It won't help. At the same time, gun free campus won't help either. Concealed carry isn't some magic thing that turns everyone into Jon McClane that can fight out of any possible scenario. 

Just a few weeks ago, some jaded husband walked into a classroom and blew a professor away, and then walked out and left campus. The gun free zone didn't do a damn thing either. 

The professor from the article doesn't seem to get it through his head, that a ""gun free campus"" won't do a thing to stop a disgruntled student to walk into class or his office and shoot him. ",-1,0,1444685929,1444717720

Mass campus shootings are so rare, that people would mostly be carrying to defend themselves from any lethal threat, not just a mass shooter. 

Normal crimes are a lot more common on a campus than the infinitesimal percentage of actually having a mass shooting situation.  ",34,0,1444685509,1444717720
