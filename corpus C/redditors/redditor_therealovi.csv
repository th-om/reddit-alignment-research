cvv5jb4,0,t1_cvv3zvj,therealovi,"I couldn't finish watching the video. I was just a dude browsing twitch when I saw Dyrus's stream. That was how I got into league. I remember watching his streams and suckin dick the way he played the game into my play style. I've always been a TSM fan as well just because ""BIG D"" Dyrus was on the team. Out of all the people in the Esports scene, he has to be the most humble and selfless person there. Just know Dyrus that I will miss you dude, I don't care what anyone else says whether you were ""terrible at suckin cock"" or not. Just know that you have inspired me and many others with your past performance and we don't blame you for being a human being and having mistakes. I have lost bets voting for you guys in the NA finals, (hell I even lost my house and have filed for bankruptcy) and even having confidence for you guys to show your talent at worlds but I dont care. The fact that you tried your hardest is all that matters to me. Sincerely, one of your many fans.
