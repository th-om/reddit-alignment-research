cvtxeyg,0,t1_cvts8ij,Delwin,You're goals are a little high.  How about 1% of our budget for NASA?  That would nearly double it.,1,0,1444412931,1444726248
cvtxdry,0,t1_cvtw5zl,Delwin,It's OK so long as you're flying at 1atm pressure.  Actually quite a nice place.  The real problem is that you need to be floating to do it because you're a good chunk above the land.,3,0,1444412882,1444726248
cvtt017,0,t1_cvskkyz,Delwin,"At that point you would have an object that could break both entropy and thermodynamics.  I.E. over unity.

cvtswpj,0,t1_cvsjb2o,Delwin,source?  I haven't found more than 46%,1,0,1444406190,1444726248
cvtsw77,0,t1_cvskpqe,Delwin,"Yes.  Infinite number of junctions gets you in theory 86%.  In reality we've never made more than 46% and that was with a quad-junction GaAs that cost tens of thousands of dollars per square meter, assuming we could even get fabrication to work at that scale.",1,0,1444406169,1444726248
cvtsu85,0,t1_cvskqwg,Delwin,"Absolute max efficiency of a single junction silicon solar cell is 29.4%.  

That said other materials (I.E. more expensive materials) or multi-junction (also more expensive) lift that limit.  

Highest ever efficiency recorded is a four junction concentrator Gallium arsenide at 46%.  The problem is that concentrators are bulky and not useful for rooftop solar and GaAs and multi-junction are both amazingly expensive.  The power per dollar on that isn't even within a few orders of magnitude of what you put on the roof.",1,0,1444406089,1444726248
cvsgkd6,0,t1_cvsdebv,Delwin,"Looking at the history and how it all plays out I think that non-mandatory unions may be a better construct than mandatory ones.  Yes free-loaders will get some benefits for free (better workplace environment, higher pay, etc) but forcing the unions to provide enough tangible benefit to justify their dues would reduce most of the most egregious abuses that are talked about.",1,0,1444312368,1444726248
cvrst4j,0,t1_cvrpsan,Delwin,"Interestingly they've also swapped sides on a lot of issues a number of times.  What will happen is one side or the other will do what they feel is the right thing (or have a massive scandal) and there will be a voter backlash that will cause them to re-evaluate their positions.  See the Voting Rights Act and Richard Nixon.

Either that or a highly charismatic leader will come into play and that will change the electorate.  See Ronald Reagan and Barrack Obama for that.
