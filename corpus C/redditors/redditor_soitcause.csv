cvopt0d,0,t1_cvoj63q,soitcause,">Perhaps we are looking at different groups; but what do you define as the MRA movement? Which group do you associate with this movement? The group of people which I am looking at address this issue a lot.

With movements like these it can often be hard to point to a certain group and say ""they're what it means to be XXX,"" but we could use /r/MensRights as our example. They do indeed talk about false accusations, but it's always in the context of the current system being flawed because there's no mechanism to protect people from them. In almost every thread on the subject people repeat that they believe rape is a very serious issue, but that it's important to not screw people over before they've even convicted of a crime. If you look at the way many schools handle sexual assault it's pretty easy to understand why so many people are upset about the way it's currently being handled (on both sides).

>This ignores socialization as a major factor as to why women do not go for the same types of work as men do. I provided some sources in different comments, but the main point is that women are socialized away from wanting to take part in STEM activities and instead are socialized towards activities which favor traditionally feminine attributes, such as teaching or nursing.

It actually isn't that simple. Norway, for example, is routinely acknowledged as one of the most gender equal countries in the world, with a populace that puts a lot of emphasis on negating gender roles. Even so, [more than 80% of Norway's engineers are men](http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/view/a_funny_thing_happened_on_the_way_to_gender_equality_in_norway) and nursing suffers from the opposite gender representation issue. So what we're seeing is that *even in a society that highly values everyone being equal* women are largely *choosing* to not enter certain fields. There's a video in the article I linked (40min, but really interesting!) that goes into this in more detail, but there's a scene where they interview a bunch of nurses and they talk about why they chose nursing. I think the current narrative around careers boasts about STEM as this high status fast track to ""success,"" but many of the women chose nursing because of the human element and the way in which they're able to socialize while working. What we have is an instance in which people have options and are opting away from ""good"" fields in favor of fields that they find personally fulfilling. There shouldn't be anything wrong with that!

>Would give the argument more credibility than it has now, but ultimately no. 

Then don't use cost/availability of abortion as a counterargument to  men being able to opt out of parenthood :P

>As it ignores that people can still hold personal religious beliefs

If someone's religious beliefs don't make it okay to mutilate their child's genitals, they shouldn't make it okay force someone into an 18+ year commitment.

> that the mother already has a greater burden even with child support

Given that she has options to circumvent this (including the sole right to choose what happens to her body), why should we give her the freedom to demand someone else give her money?

>and that such a plan would completely take women out of the equation in terms of deciding whether she gets to keep the baby.

It would do no such thing. A woman would have the exact same rights she has now - she would just have to be financially secure in her own right. Do you not think it's strange to say that a woman's decision to have/not have a baby should be based on whether or not another person has the ability/volition to pay for it?

>Its fair to assume that the person (if we don't assume the traditional roles) who has the greater responsibility in taking care of that child (pregnancy and child birth), should have a greater say in whether or not they keep the child.

Which will always be the woman because she's the one that gets pregnant. But the reason we say that it's a woman's choice isn't because she has more responsibility - it's because forcing someone to do something for 9 months violates their bodily autonomy. Who ""takes care"" of the baby has nothing to do with being pregnant (stay at home dads are a thing!). In that same vein, *no one is saying women shouldn't be able to raise kids on their own*, just that a man shouldn't be *forced* to pay for a child they didn't want.

>its the child who needs it

If this were the actual reason then giving your child up for adoption would be illegal because you're just giving away your responsibility to pay for the child.

>Its pretty unethical to force a mother to have an abortion/put her child up for adoption just because she doesn't want to live in poverty trying to take care of the child.
.
>Its pretty unethical to force a **father** to **have a child**when **he doesn't want to live in poverty** trying to take care of the child.

That's why this is a contentious issue. I don't think anyone *wants* to leave a child without enough resources to have a good upbringing, but child support is expensive and really limits where you personally can go going forward if you're on the hook for 18 years. I'm a 23 year old student; if I knocked someone up tomorrow and they insisted on raising the kid I'd be fucked because 1) I can't make them get an abortion (which is a good thing, but) 2) I'd have to drop out of school and start working a dismal job just to pay child support. My future would be shot because someone else made a decision about what *they* wanted. That's kinda unfair.",3,0,1444030595,1444719947
cvoieli,1,t3_3nd7hs,soitcause,">Probably the most iconic MRA belief would be their belief that false rape accusations are as important of an issue than rape itself. 

This is not an MRA view.

>The MRA belief that the pay gap is far smaller than described (the 78 cents to one dollar stat) is exceedingly disingenuous.

MRAs' views are mostly founded in methodological individualism (like first wave feminism), whereas current 3rd/4th wave feminism is very much based in methodological collectivism. This means that whereas current feminists care a lot about group outcomes, MRAs tend to care more about individual liberties. Basically it's an issue of equality of opportunity versus equality of outcome. MRAs acknowledge that there are large gender gaps in many fields, but believe that because women have opportunities and are highly incentivized (through grants, scholarships, social programs etc) to enter those fields, the fact that they are largely underrepresented is kinda on them.

>This argument ignores the fact that abortions are exceedingly difficult to get in certain parts of the United States.

If abortions were free and available evrywhere would you be okay with the idea of men being able to opt out of fatherhood?

>This argument also ignores that man played a part in creating this child

Women always play a part in getting pregnant. Does that mean abortions shouldn't be legal?

> the fact that this would guarantee that the women involved and the child being raised would be much poorer and consequently, much worse off

This goes back to the point about opportunity. If a woman cannot afford to care for a child and the father notifies her that he is unwilling to care for it, why is the woman entitled to the man's support? She has the option of abortion, as well as adoption, as well as various social services depending on her income. In the same way it'd be fucked up to make an unwilling woman carry a child to term, it's fucked up to make an unwilling man pay for a child he didn't want for 18 years.
