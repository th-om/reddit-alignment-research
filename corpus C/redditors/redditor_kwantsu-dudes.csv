cvx88lx,0,t1_cvx7650,kwantsu-dudes,"> Citing a sterile couple doesn't help your argument because it doesn't describe an entire *class* of relationships. Elderly people *as a class* are allowed to marry, despite the general inability for them *as a class* to produce offspring. 

Restrictions on contracts offered by the state are not restricted to *class*.  They can use what ever they want as long as there is a *percieved ""reasonable*"" reason to do so. That's how the law is written. If someone wants to percieve that being gay is a ""reasonable"" reason to stop them from getting married, the law has their back.

> This is literally my point: there's no logical argument for opposing same-sex marriage that isn't motivated by hate. You haven't provided one, so I don't really see how your comment is relevant. 

How about this view. The government adopted marriage contracts to motivate couples to come together, live together, and procreate. If you can prove to me that this view is flat out false, I'll agree with you. Since I believe that's a possible reason why marriage was adopted by the government, I think it's reasonable to make the laws restricting who can get married based on the view. (Again, I don't believe this, I'm just defending your accusation that there is no ""reasonable"" reason except hate).

> at least recognize the logical consistency of the opposition to consanguine marriages.

There is no logically consistency. In no way should marriage be tied to procreation. You believing there is only helps defend the ""reasonable"" views I provided above. Either marriage deals with procreation or it doesn't. If it does we can ban consanguine marriage and also have a reasonable reason to ban gay marriage. If it doesn't, (which I propose is the *actual* logical view), than gays as well as blood related couples should be able to marry. We have SEPARATE LAWS making it illegal to have sex with a blood related person. To restrict marriage simply because of the ""known possibility"" is completely idiotic and goes against what many of our other laws protect.

Or if you still want to be defensive on the ""hate"" debate, it only shows the views of wanting to ban consaguine marriage is based *solely on hate* also. In which case I'll agree with your point.",1,0,1444676947,1444721747
cvx5v7h,0,t1_cvwyy3m,kwantsu-dudes,"Yes there is. Marriage is a contract offered by the state. ""Contracts"" can and HAVE certain provisions. We *currently* have laws that restrict two consenting adults from getting marriage. Blood related marriages are illegal in most states. Why? Because of harmful effects on potential kids? So we are apparently tying reproduction to marriage (which I think is stupid). So why can we not restrict gays from getting married because they can not reproduce?

Oh, but you say that what about the other straight couples that are sterile and can't reproduce and are allowed to marry? Well what about the blood related couple that is sterile? They still aren't allowed to marry.

So if you want to have views on this, realize all our laws are fucked up and DEEPLY guided more by morals (how people feel at the time) than anything concrete in legality or equality.

By the way, I support marriage for all. But if you are going to support the removal of one restriction and be against ""hate"", but then show that same hate towards other people who are restricted, your whole argument is trash.

cvuktid,0,t1_cvugj7n,kwantsu-dudes,"First off, you aren't addressing the point. Its either living or not. It's either killing one life or two. The government protects lives by giving punishment to those that violate the *rights of that person*. If it's not a human life with given rights, then nothing is being infringed. Double homicide for a pregnant women is an idiotic law if you percieve that human rights are given at birth. It's that simple.

Secondly, this is such a stupid point that gets *repeated a lot* around here. It's only a possible point if abortion isn't allowed in cases of rape. And considering the majority of people (including the majority of republicans) are fine with rape exemptions, the point is stupid. This is because in cases of rape there was no say. But if you consciously make the decision to have sex, you are accepting the consequences of that decision. And yes, pregnancy is a possible outcome of sex. And it is in this decision that you are signing off your right to not ""host another person inside their body"". ... Plus it's such a stupid argument to begin with. ""Hosting another person in their body"" is **how we generate life**. People are not held to some great authority of giving up their body. They are participating in an act of nature. Its how you came to be. Its how your parents came to be. Etc.. Its not anything like being required to give up your kidney.

Okay. I see your point now. And I agree. 

They certainly are selling a product. Which for any product advertisement, usually informs you a bit on the product, but does spend more time on how you will feel with the product. Emotional appeal.

Pedophilia is, according to a majority of doctors and current records, a mental disorder. My point, as well as it seems yours, *is that it shouldn't be*. You can't be condescending to me when you misinterpret my belief to begin with. *Dumbass*

> and that was your support for calling gays mentally ill.

Again, thanks for assigning a belief to me. In no way did I ever show support of that idea. 

> Pedophiles are persecuted for the harm they cause others, not for their views.

Pedophiles have an attraction to prepubescent children. That's it. I think you are thinking of child molestors. A *common* misconception, but a ridiculous one. It would be like me associating homosexuality to rape. It's idiotic.

I'm sorry, but your blatant misinterpretation of my beliefs (as well as your misguided views on people of different sexual orientations) are truly irritating.

You are the problem. You champion gays for being comfortable in their own sexual attraction, but at the same time chastise another for their own sexual attraction while pretending *you* are the great one fighting for equality. SMH",1,0,1444431301,1444721747

I'm not seeing your point here. Care to elaborate? I was comparing Homosexuality to Pedophilia as they both deal with sexual attraction and pedophilia is still regarded as a mental disorder where homosexuality is not.

> Shall we use the existence of Islamophobia to call Muslims mentally ill? 

? What? No.... That's exactly why I'm mentioning how the **actual** definition of a mental disorder is stupid as it relys on one's fitting in with society. It ignores the scenario where the majority could be the ""mentally ill"" ones. So it basically comes down to calling certain people mentally ill if we as a society deem them ""outcasts"". Its not a well defined line at all. Which is my problem with it. We will call people mentally ill until the point where we believe we are actually being offensive to that group and recant that description. ...Which I find pathetic.",1,0,1444428735,1444721747
