cvmt8hg,0,t1_cvmqlvd,alcoholic_father,Iran and Cuba are on his side and he doesn't consider them the enemy like he does american citizens who believe in the second amendment.  He was willing to compromise with them and give them most of what they wanted but he won't budge once from his insistence on gun confiscation.,1,0,1443887669,1444721341
cvl9622,1,t3_3n36rm,alcoholic_father,"Why is anyone surprised that this administration would do this?  They did it with the IRS to embarass and harass the tea party, they put critics like Dinesh D Sousa in jail, and they will use the secret service to attack opponents.  Obama is the most corrupt president in American history.  ",1,0,1443751683,1444721341
cvjsshi,0,t1_cvjomnf,alcoholic_father,But she was involved in the death of an government official.  Are you denying that Ambassador Stevens was killed?,-42,0,1443649532,1444721341
cvfz6gt,1,t3_3mjns9,alcoholic_father,"Why should a president have experience being poor?  We don't want people to be poor and should make every effort to discourage people from being poor.  Being poor is associated with having bad values and decision making, and that would be terrible for a leader.  We want a leader who knows what it is like to be successful, not weak.  Experiencing life as something bad is not a good thing.  You wouldn't want a president to live as an islamic terrorist for a week would you?  ",3,0,1443376775,1444721341
cvfyrjd,1,t3_3mkq5t,alcoholic_father,"I support Ted Cruz because he is serious about his principles and won't back down.  He will fight for the constitution and to protect America.  I think that if you support America being strong and successful and you believe in the constitution, you can't go wrong with most of the republicans running.  Just don't vote for Kasich please.  He is not a conservative.  He is an Obamabot in elephant clothing.",-2,0,1443376158,1444721341
cvfxi7v,1,t3_3mj5bt,alcoholic_father,"Because it is a monopoly that alters the market and therefore results in less efficient environmental protection.  The environment would be better protected if the market was able to function properly.  The EPA needs to justify its existence and increased budget by worsening environmental conditions, whereas corporations have an actual interest in protecting the environment.  The EPA does way more environmental harm than good.",-2,0,1443374197,1444721341
cve7lmk,1,t3_3mdovu,alcoholic_father,"He did not stand up to President Obama.  He could have stood up for conservative principles but in almost every case he would not stand up.  The will of the people is there to repeal Obamacare, block the iran deal, and to investigate Obama and Holder and he caved everytime.  We did not elect republicans to control the house so they could do Obama's bidding, and he has stood in conservatives way always.",-5,0,1443217401,1444721341

cvdyxbx,0,t1_cvdtrph,alcoholic_father,Just because it might be difficult is no reason to murder your baby.   I'd rather the kids have a difficult life than be murdered in cold blood.  It's selfishness and callousness.  That's what separates conservatives from liberals.  Liberals would murder their own baby just for convenience.  ,1,0,1443203056,1444721341
