cvxw3sf,0,t1_cvxvylw,shinyskarmory,"New body would probably work, it would make him physically strong enough to actually incap people during time stop. I'm still worried because time stop is a really really silly ability, but because of the actual mechanics of Rolo's time stop I guess it could be alright. ",1,0,1444716982,1444723335
cvxw0pf,0,t1_cvxvurv,shinyskarmory,"The question isn't whether The Thing can be harmed by physical attacks (as due to conservation of momentum/energy basically anything can be harmed or blasted away if the physical attack has sufficient force behind it). The question is whether anyone can safely attack it in melee without being assimilated. 

I guess my key questions are: 

* How long does someone have to be engulfed in Thing before they are incapped? Can it just surge over you like a tidal wave and assimilate you, or does it have to digest you for a while (during which you could presumably escape if you remained conscious)? 

* How much of the Thing has to be destroyed to call it an incap? Do we have atomize it to the sub-cellular level, or can we just destroy all visible chunks? What's the smallest chunk of the Thing that still counts as 'able to fight' for the purpose of this Scramble?

* What's the size of the smallest chunk of the Thing that can successfully perform an assimilation, relative to the normal size of the Thing? And how quickly can a chunk that size do it?",1,0,1444716703,1444723335
cvxvtu4,0,t1_cvxvk0m,shinyskarmory,"I really don't think so. Lelouch has next to no physical feats while Batman and Cap are 100% physical feats. Batman can hold his breath for 7 minutes, so even if Lelouch ""stops time"" he can't actually stop time for long enough to finish off Batman without killing himself. 

You could solve that issue by giving him a gun, but if you give him a gun then he 10/10s anyone who can't survive a headshot in time stop and we're back to square one. 

Also, if you decide to replace, there's no obligation to use the character I suggested, grab anyone you want who fits into the tier and use them. ",1,0,1444716116,1444723335
cvxvkkw,0,t1_cvxvb2i,shinyskarmory,"Hmm... He seems pretty powerful but has clear, exploitable weaknesses. The question is whether Batman or Cap could figure out his weaknesses before being assimilated...

I don't want to say Thing is too powerful, but I think it has other issues. I think Thing will have matchups against a lot of teams (any team that doesn't have fire or electricity) where it just 10/10 solos the team by itself. For that reason, I'd recommend changing him, although I think he fits within the tier. He/it just doesn't seem like it would create fun battles because of how swingy he is.",1,0,1444715355,1444723335

I'd like to challenge Lelouch vi Brittania. Unrestricted, he's hilariously broken (not overpowered, but game breaking) because he either 10/10s or 0/10s every character in the game. With your restrictions, I just can't see him beating Batman or Captain America, even with time stop and mind reading. Just because he'll be able to know what attack Batman is planning next doesn't mean that he'll be able to stop it or do anything about it. That's one of the few fights in this list that I honestly think is 0/10. 

I would honestly recommend removing and replacing him, as he's just too swingy. If you're looking for another manipulative bastard character, may I recommend [Fire Emblem spoilers](/s 'Sephiran (wiki: http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Sephiran)') if you don't have another idea of your own? He can at least cast damaging magic on his opponents and has enhanced durability. ",2,0,1444714847,1444723335

A few pointers:

* Pokemon typings are usually based on an actual elemental affinity and not stats (endurance is measured independently of type). As such, I don't think Steel type is appropriate for Lady Deadpool; Normal or Fighting type is probably more accurate, but if it's not a big deal to anyone else, it's not a big deal to me. 

* Other then that, Lady Deadpool, Ganta Igarashi, and Scott Pilgrim all look fine, from what I can see, though I would appreciate someone else looking at Ganta in particular because he's pretty close to the line of what I'd consider acceptable. 

* The Thing, on the other hand, is tricky. The link in your post doesn't go to a respect thread, it goes to a link to a movie, and given how all of my searches for your Thing get swallowed up by the Fantastic Four Thing, I'd really like it if you'd give me some feats so I can gauge its power level.

cvxung3,0,t1_cvxtf0k,shinyskarmory,"I'll argue Misaka first since I don't feel that she's too powerful at all. Yes, she has very impressive esper feats, but her physical abilities are totally unenhanced. As I mentioned in my signup post, she has the strength and (running) of a normal middle school girl, and would easily be overwhelmed by Batman or Captain America if they managed to get into melee range against her ([and believe me,](http://imgur.com/a/UDHI0) [they can get in range on her.](http://imgur.com/a/9z9sR#1)). Think that Misaka can just poke him with the voltage of a thousand cattle prods once he gets in? [Think again.](http://imgur.com/a/BOZx0#0) The tier is defined as ""people who can beat Batman/Cap 1-9/10, and since there's a clear, easy to imagine scenario where Misaka loses, I think it's hard to say she's not in the tier. 

As for Saber of Red (Mordred), you're right that Servant feats are generally incredible, and tbh I was a little worried about putting her in, too. However, unless I'm underestimating her strength again, I don't think her feats (excepting those like Clarent Blood Arthur and Servant mundane attack immunity, which I already locked out in my signup post) are all that out of line with those of Batman or Cap. [Batman is a bullet timer](http://imgur.com/I08YoH6) and [can throw around 600 pound bad guys](http://imgur.com/N557bqd), while Cap [gets launched through buildings](http://imgur.com/a/8MEGW#0) [without a scratch](http://puu.sh/iMoVu/5f5de04297.jpg). 

In other words, it's not that Misaka and Mordred are too strong, it's that Batman and Captain America are stronger, faster, and tougher then you think. 

If other people and/or /u/mrcelophane still think they're too powerful after examining the limitations in my original post or looking at the Cap/Batman feats in more detail, then I'm happy to provide an alternate suggestion for either or both. I have an idea for Mordred already that will be almost equivalent to her but is just a character with a lower power level, while I might need until tomorrow for Misaka if you still want to replace her after seeing the feats I posted.",1,0,1444712840,1444723335
cvwxvd6,0,t1_cvwvnqu,shinyskarmory,"All of the characters I posted are on Captain America's level 90% of the time, but have one-time or situational bonuses that would make them broken. 

Consider Sadao Maou as an example. His human form feats are somewhat impressive but not fantastic, and his magic is situational, but still useful. But, on the other hand, he has a super form he can trigger when people around him are terrified or afraid that is clearly high street/low neighborhood tier. It doesn't make sense to say ""this character is too powerful for this tier"" when the 5-10% of the time he's too powerful for the tier is so situational that it might as well be irrelevant 90% of the time.

Or take Saber of Red. Her feats aren't really all that outstanding for Servants (and IIRC I saw at least one other servant in the competition) but the problem for this competition comes from the fact that in universe Servants are *immune* to mundane (non magical) weaponry. While I could have left this rule intact, that would have guaranteed that she beats everyone but the special attackers and some trainers 1v1, which is kind of silly. The medieval armor thing is just to clarify that her armor, other than perfectly concealing her identity, has no special powers and isn't any stronger than period armor.

It comes down to character diversity in the end. If, in the end, they end up being at the appropriate power level, and the restrictions are simple and easy to understand, then I don't see the problem with it. And basically all of these restrictions except for the one on Saber of Red's mundane damage immunity effectively amount to ""you can't use their incredibly situational super move/form because that would break the game"".",3,0,1444660998,1444723335

Physical Attacker: **Saber of Red, Fate/Apocrypha** ([respect thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/3apvc8/respect_saber_of_red_fateapocrypha/)) as a **Steel** type. 

While she is an (anti) hero of Arturian legend, for the most part her equipment itself is nonmagical. Her armor is standard knight's armor of the period, whose only enchantments are those that hide her identity; it shares all the vulnerabilities and drawbacks of medieval armor. Her sword Clarent is a normal sword except for its wave motion gun activation, which she doesn't have enough mana to use (see below).

Limitations:

* *No immunity to mundane weaponry*. Servants normally possess immunity to nonmagical weaponry that is not wielded by another Servant, but that would be rather silly in a competition like this. 

* *Does not have sufficient mana to use her Noble Phantasm Clarent Blood Arthur.* She may still wield Clarent as a normal sword, but it does not possess its active ability.

Special Attacker: **Misaka Mikoto, the Railgun/the Ace of Tokiwadai/the Electric Princess/Biribiri** ([WIP respect thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/3drt4r/respect_mikoto_misaka_index_franchise/)) as an **Electric** type. 

Misaka's primary power is the control of the flow of electricity nearby her, which allows her to by extension gain some magnetism-based powers as well (including her signature technique, the Railgun). She has used her primary electric powers to zap nearby enemies into unconsciousness, hack nearby electronics with close contact and extreme concentration (she can't fight effectively while hacking), and get her stalkery friend Kuroko off of her. Her magnetism based powers are weaker but are still important to consider; her main use of them is to draw iron particles out of the ground around her, forming them into a manipulable mass called Iron Sand; however, it takes her time to draw out the necessary amount of iron, leaving her vulnerable while doing so. 

Limitations:

* *May not activate her Level 6 form*, for obvious balance reasons. It's a temporary state of near-metropolitan level power that's only achieved in one arc of her storyline for a short time using the aid of an external device. 

* If she's still too powerful, *disallow her from using Railgun.* Railgun is a powerful attack that uses magnetism to accelerate a coin to incredible speeds, effectively vaporizing it and functioning as a wave motion beam like attack. I don't think she's overpowered, but if others do then disabling Railgun is a possible nerf.

EDIT: Her electricity feats may make her appear a little too powerful for Batman/Cap tier, but both of them could easily defeat her in a single blow or less if they managed to close the gap. For all of her speed and electricity/magnetism feats, she's still a middle school girl and doesn't have the strength or durability feats to go toe to toe with Batman or Cap. They should destroy her if they close the gap and enter melee range.

The Monster: **Gary's Scizor, (Pokemon anime)** ([gary's respect thread, scroll down for Scizor](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/3imt2c/respect_gary_oak_pokemon_anime/)) as a **Bug** type.

Limitations:

* **May not enter demon form.** That means human/intelligence/minor magic feats only. His demon form can only be achieved in the presence of terrified humans, and is somewhere between street and metropolitan level which is clearly too high for this competition. Since almost all of his time is spent in human form anyways, it shouldn't make a difference.

* **May not call upon his demon army for assistance**, which should go without saying. ",4,0,1444623723,1444723335
