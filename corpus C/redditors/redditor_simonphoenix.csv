Wrong, ethnocentric, and wrong.

Ireland began the transition to Catholicism in the 5th century. The Irish aren't/weren't Catholic just for the sake of rebelling against the English. The English HATED Ireland's Catholicism. Many English fueled their Protestant faith with anti-Irish nationalism...is not something that I would typically write but it's probably closer to the truth than your statement.

I wish I could say that I'm shocked by what you wrote but unfortunately centuries of British propaganda have destroyed the memory of an amazing people.

While realistic, I think that expectation is bullshit. If you give the COURTESY of 2 weeks notice then that courtesy should be extended back to you. It's simply submission otherwise.

So how did the landlords fit in? Were the tiny plots part of a larger piece of property or are we describing separate scenarios that exacerbated the situation in their own way?

The severity of the famine and how it was handled seems to be largely forgotten in America. How is anyone suppose to understand the conflicts between Ireland and Northern Ireland without that context? It's changed the way that I look at ethnic conflicts worldwide. There's always a story. It's not just violence for the sake of violence.

I've taken an interest in investigating English oppression of Celtic cultures overall. It's startling how much predujice I read about today. Not just the general disdain for Celtic peoples but outright misinformation being spread.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/cornish_nation_01.shtml

>For centuries, the Cornish tongue had been gradually retreating to the west as the common people of eastern Cornwall steadily abandoned it in favour of English

Willingly? While the Prayer Book Rebellion is mentioned immediately afterwards, this sentence seems to downplay the fact that Celtic people were ""gradually"" pushed off of their lands.

BBC's History of Ireland is no better. They delved into genetic genealogy, another interest of mine, and claimed that a large portion of the Welsh population shared DNA typically associated with Ireland. They then went on to say something to effect of, ""Well, um, you see it appears that Ireland invaded England at one point so maybe we should all just get along."" What? Ignoring the fact that it would make sense that a Celtic people would share DNA with another Celtic people that were only separated by a body of water (which I would argue would make them that much closer), you can't just say let bygones be bygones when you're the one left holding the goodie bag.

*breath* I don't hate the English and I don't want more violence unless it's absolutely necessary. I hate misinformation. I truly want to learn as much as I can during my time on this planet. People who spread lies make that goal harder. Though, seeing how the British spread misinformation has helped me better identify misinformation in my own country. I just wish I didn't have to deal with it at all.
