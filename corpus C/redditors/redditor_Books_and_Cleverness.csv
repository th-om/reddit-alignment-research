cvxugaa,1,t3_3oiw2c,Books_and_Cleverness,"I can't speak for all reddit but I can certainly point to three major issues on which Hillary was very wrong.  IMHO these are not small, fringe issues.  These are not the kinds of things you can afford to be wrong about if you're the President of the United States of America.

1.) Authorizing use of force in Iraq.

2.) Supporting marriage as ""between a man and a woman.""

3.) Supporting the War on Drugs, mass incarceration, etc.

FWIW, your list is pretty blatantly partisan.  ""Clinton helped restore Americaâ€™s leadership..."" I mean, what?  Sure, if you think that, that's all well and good, but it's a completely an opinion and a judgment call, not an accomplishment you can assume others will agree on.

If you think America needed to be more involved in Syria early on to prevent the horrors that have happened since, Hillary Clinton did no such thing---she did the opposite.  I don't happen to want to be involved in any more wars over there, but I'm just saying your list is full of things you personally think are good, and in some cases things that never truly happened, even though I would have liked them to, e.g. the ""Pivot to Asia.""",1,1,1444712340,1444728750
cvxbhz9,0,t1_cvx5v90,Books_and_Cleverness,">45% of the tax on how much of the taxable income?

[Around 20%](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/jan/30/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-top-1-percent-earn-more-national-inc/), at least according to PolitiFact.

I'm not saying it's unfair, I'm just saying closing ""loopholes"" for taxing the rich isn't going to solve our budget problems.  The federal government's budget is like $3 trillion and the deficit was around $750 billion in 2013.  Pretty sure the top 1% earns roughly $2 trillion total.  Do the math.  Your tax rate on the wealthy would have to go from 36% to like 65% to close the deficit for a single year, and that is assuming those top 1% don't just move their money and their business elsewhere, which they would be insane not to do.",1,0,1444681594,1444728750

This is definitely true but I can't imagine a 1%-er making, say, $500K per year is using roads, bridges, firefighters, schools, etc., *45 times more* than the average man.  We aren't going to close the budget deficit by closing loopholes alone.

>Even small businesses gain more from a road being constructed and maintained in front of their property than the average person driving on that road.

So the small business gains more from *that particular road,* but less from most of the other roads.  I don't see how this is different than a homeowner or any other person, who benefits disproportionately from the roads he needs to make his living.  Further, the customers of the small business also benefit disproportionately from that road, as do the other businesses that sell to that small business, and so on.

I'm not sure you've shown that small businesses gain more from roads *in general.*  You've only pointed to *one particular road* (or series of roads) from which that business benefits disproportionately.",0,0,1444676957,1444728750
