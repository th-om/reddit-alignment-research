cvxqjxi,0,t1_cvxqftl,Tazzure,Yes I suppose Rengar and Ekko are similar in that respect but Rengar isn't as versatile in the other respects that Ekko is. ,3,0,1444704951,1444726326

cvxoihh,0,t1_cvxob38,Tazzure,You do. You take AS runes because they are still more efficient than AD. You can take AD if you want but your laning will be even worse. One of Blue Ez's biggest strengths as a kiting AD caster has actually always been his ability to still auto well and fairly quickly with the build. Makes him much more versatile. ,2,0,1444701740,1444726326
cvxnctu,0,t1_cvxn96o,Tazzure,"It's looking like 

Top: Solo? 

Jung: him

Mid: Goldenglue

ADC: LOD/Keith

Supp:?? 

Top and supp could easily be imports or they could just be waiting to see what happens post Worlds. Either way Meteos and Goldenglue can be a lot of fun. ",2,0,1444699953,1444726326
cvxn0sj,0,t1_cvxmcnx,Tazzure,"I think he's hard to play around at all elos. Until you play a bunch of games against him his Ult and W are hard to always have in mind, and his burst windows are always present post 6 because of that. He plays so differently than other assassins and is great as a beefy mage in the jungle. I think Runeglaive Ekko is like a top soloQ pick if you spam him and learn his ins and outs and master abusing those windows and W placement. ",1,0,1444699447,1444726326
cvxlt6q,0,t1_cvxkjt0,Tazzure,"Sad I went from maining Eve to Ekko, I don't have too much longer before his W has no stun, his Q doesn't come back, and his ult costs 250 mana.",16,0,1444697598,1444726326
