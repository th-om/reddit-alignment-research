cvxvvlt,1,t3_3oiw2c,TonyDiGerolamo,"1.  Clinton, as Secretary of State, accused our Pakistani allies of harboring Osama Bin Laden in public.  That's not how America's top diplomat should act toward an ally, whether they were lying or not.

2.  Sanctions are an act of war.

3.  That's one, but she was part of team.

4.  Which turned out to be a complete sham.  The Pakistanis were sitting on him.

5.  Giving her credit for making peace with Gaza?  Seriously?  Have you seen that open air prison?  Not much of an accomplishment considering every administration since LBJ has been dealing with it.  And it's not much of a ""war"" more like a slaughter.

6.  Except Iraq is still a basketcase, spiraling further down and into the hands of ISIS, as is Afghanistan.  And we won't actually leave, just drawn down the troops to maintain permanent military bases.  That's not really an end, more of a cool down until the next crisis for the Policemen of the World.

6.  Starting the next war with China?  What exactly will that do for us other than cost more lives and treasure?  Assuming the Chinese don't immediately flood the market with dollars and bankrupt us.

7.  The massacres in Libya continue and the country is even worse than Iraq.  For this mess alone, she should withdraw her candidacy.

8.  Economic statecraft?  Is that anything like World of Warcraft?  Because they both sound like fantasy.

9.  How?  By requesting the State Department have it's own army or when she ordered department employees to try and steal the credit card numbers of diplomats at the U.N. as per the WikiLeaks cables?

10.  How?  By showing she can lie just as well as a male politician?  

As much as I can't stand the economic policies of Bernie Sanders, at least he's not an unrepentant warmonger like Clinton.",1,1,1444716264,1444726868

cvxo8eu,0,t1_cvxh5yf,TonyDiGerolamo,"Sounds to me like you've already drawn a conclusion before examining the evidence and you're just trying to twist the article to support what you believe.  That soldiers have commanders does not excuse war crimes, regardless of the soldier's country of command.

If you have evidence of your theory, then post it.  ",1,0,1444701289,1444726868
