cvvm72n,1,t3_3o9fl1,Sion4000,Fender Guitars. They offer some of the best quality in almost every price range they offer. The Mexican made Standard series is widely considered the absolute best value in a guitar. Their American models (especially the American Vintage and Custom Shop) are some of the best guitars ever made and they usually charge less than some of the other top end guitar manufacturers. Especially that one that starts with a G... But seriously I'd say the guitars the Custom Shop is putting out now are every bit as good as the guitars they made in the 50's. Imo this owes to the woods used Fender style guitars. With the exception of Brazillian rosewood (which wasn't used in all years anyway) all the woods used in Fender guitars are readily available non endangered species. Because the wood used on vintage guitars is readily available just as it was there's no decline in quality due to having to use inferior cuts of wood due to a decline in availability. In fact a lot of modern reissues now use better one piece bodies exclusively when the originals would have often settled for a two piece.,3,0,1444547332,1444724692
cvvlzdx,0,t1_cvv8st2,Sion4000,They are incredible. Up until age 16 or so I'd buy a new $50 pair of headphones every 6 months or so and they'd break without fail. Finally dropped $350 on some HD 650's and they've lasted to this day. I'm 22 now. 6 years and still going! I would have spent over $600 on shitty headphones at my old rate. Not to mention the sound quality is just fantastic. Whether your playing games or listening to music they provide the best audio experience I've ever heard. The bass response is absolutely unreal and I still remember being able to precisely locate things like drops of blood dripping from the ceiling and rats scurrying in F.E.A.R. (Great game with some of the best sound design of any game.),1,0,1444546569,1444724692
