When you have to find a way to get to 'yes', and the customer is possibly mentally handicapped, you have fun getting to 'yes' in the most disarming yet humiliating manner possible. Showing someone how to use their own software is a fun way to show people you're better at their job than they are. Resetting someone's password for the 4th time in a day with a smile on your face is also a great way to simultaneously humiliate and service the customer. ",1,0,1444673016,1444716302

> In theory, women would be less likely to suffer abuse at the hands of pimps, less likely to be involved in human trafficking, and more likely to earn a decent wage.

> And yet, the system hasn't worked – it's made things worse.

> A prostitute in Amsterdam, a notoriously expensive city, will pay up to one hundred euro a night for the rent of a window.

>  She also has to pay a pimp, and pay taxes if she registers – though only 5% of prostitutes have actually registered for tax, perhaps for fear of the social stigma that comes with publicly announcing yourself as a prostitute.

> Just in order to take some home for herself she'll have to have sex with ten to fifteen people per day. The vocal union for the sex workers, De Rode Draad, went bankrupt and closed down in 2009. In addition to this, 13 sex workers have been murdered in De Wallen since 1990.

> After twenty years of legalised prostitution, the council ended up cutting down the Red Light district's brothels from 482 to 243 after bouts of criminal activity.

Different industries behave differently. This is simple economics. Prostitutes, cigars, racecars, and apples aren't all widgets with identical factors for seasonality of production, elasticity of demand, or skill involved in manufacture and distribution.",2,0,1444544031,1444716302
cvvl5bs,0,t1_cvv33dp,GetZePopcorn,"> What about a rigorous licensing process? Make it fairly expensive to pay for the cost of auditing the brothels, have at least cursory background checks to make sure trafficking hasn't occurred, and good health practices.

Germany already has that. It did NOTHING to stop sex trafficking. It probably just made the prostitutes poorer.",1,0,1444543743,1444716302
cvvl4i5,0,t1_cvuzlq3,GetZePopcorn,"No. It didn't prevent it in Germany or the Netherlands. Say what you want about the Germans...but they regulate very, very well.

Prior to legalization, the entire industry was subject to legal surveillance. As a result of the newfound legality, there's very few ways in which one can detect sex slavery - unless the slaves who are kept without passports and intentionally kept dependent on their ""owners"" can muster up the time and courage to come forward and report.",1,0,1444543674,1444716302

Bad: paternalism, purity, morality of sex-shaming, inequality of male/female sexuality.

Good: where prostitution has been legalized in countries which allow immigration (pretty much all of them except Australia), rates of sex trafficking skyrocket. Sex trafficking is slavery.",1,0,1444543181,1444716302
