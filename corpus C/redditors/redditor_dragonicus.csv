Their strategy was to align all resources behind Bush as the presumptive nominee, pull in the next-most-popular also-ran as VP, and shut the primary process down ASAP so they could focus on party unity, which they failed to do in both 2008 (where Romney and Huckabee stayed until late in the race) and 2012 (a full roster of challengers to Romney's frontrunner status throughout Primary season).

Trump is spoiling the plan by making their electable candidates look timid and forcing them way too far the right on immigration which pretty much guarantees a loss in the general election. He's costing them time and resources as long as he stays in the race, and each day he stays in they get one step closer to losing the White House.",1,0,1443049419,1444724844

cv27eui,0,t1_cv22hk4,dragonicus,">a lot of the war drama is expressed to you via the in game radio dialogue and you actually take part in it?

This is a different animal. I would call it a cutscene that cleverly dovetails with the gameplay. Think of any game where you hear 'watch out, to your left!' and then something explodes on the left side of the screen. You have control of the player character in those sequences, but you aren't actually influencing anything (unless you fail to dodge the explosion I guess). Are you still 'playing' in any real sense, or just watching the scene through the player character's eyes?

I'm also familiar with games that provide feedback on your actions, like 'shoot that exploding barrel!' *BANG* *BANG* **BOOM** '...nice shot, kid!' The player has more agency in these sequences, but the feedback (audio/visual) has to be extremely well done to match the cinematic quality of a well-thought-out cutscene, in my opinion.

I think you also need to distinguish between what is a dramatic experience for you as the player (defeating a tough boss) and what is a dramatic experience in the context of the game itself, for the characters in the story. In the latter the drama comes from feeling empathy for the characters, which can be amped up with the use of music, dialogue, camera angles, etc. that are typically part of any good cutscene. Player-drama is a more solitary experience, in that you feel good about what you accomplished, but the fact that YOU accomplished something (as opposed to your character) is meaningless (or means something different) in the context of the gameworld. The other characters in the story don't know that it took you 12 tries to beat the last level, and they don't care.

So I would say I agree with you that if player-drama is your thing then keeping control and having agency is going to create the most intense experience. If story-drama is your thing then the cutscene is still the best method, in my opinion. The greatest games are the ones that manage to blend these elements together (think BioShock) and try to maximize both.",1,0,1442315134,1444724844
cv1mik4,0,t1_cv18fvh,dragonicus,"I would counter and say that games which do let you keep control do so at the cost of any drama or heightened excitement that a cutscene can provide. Consider any Bethesda game, where you finally come face-to-face with an important character and at the climactic moment of their defeat they just go ragdoll and flop to the floor. I prefer more of the dramatic elements, even if it means being a spectator for a few moments instead of a player.",3,0,1442267449,1444724844
cv115p6,1,t3_3kvqjw,dragonicus,I don't understand the complaint. Video games have been doing this (taking the player out of the action at key moments) for literally decades. I think you've answered your own question - the game designer/director obviously felt that this is how the story needed to be told.,4,0,1442230520,1444724844

That there is any 'debate' at all over whether a county clerk needs to follow the law as prescribed by the Supreme Court is merely political gamesmanship.
