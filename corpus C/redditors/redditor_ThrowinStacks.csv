1) I want to live longer. 

Asking me to eat meat is like asking a non-smoker to smoke.

 >   Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses.

Remember, don't fight each other, fight the problem. The problem is not her intention, but her understanding. Instead of an ultimatum, tell her how you feel. Share the information with her, and ask her to watch Cowspiracy with you. Don't make her think that it's an ultimatum before she has all of the information you have, that will only provoke a negative response. If she refuses to listen or watch then decide your next step, because that shows very little concern for your feelings. If she does listen and watch the movie and still hasn't changed her mind, at least she will probably be more considerate and aware of her actions. Don't sacrifice a great relationship because change doesn't happen immediately. See how her attitude towards you and veganism develops. If it becomes worse, then I would leave.
