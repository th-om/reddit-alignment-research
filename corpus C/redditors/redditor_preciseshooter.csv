You have a lot of proposals for things that need to be done, and you promise to fight for them - can you prove that you will be successful in implementing it? What is your job history? What are your skills? Have you managed large complex organization before?

Can you tell us about the instances in your career where data disagreed with your instincts and what you did?",2,0,1444682962,1444716262

cvvzngj,0,t1_cvvx8ka,preciseshooter,"FFL dealer here. China makes guns. General the guns they make fall into two types - clones of Soviet guns (T53 are equivalent of M44, T56 are equivalent of SKS, they also copied Tokarev, Makarov - very rare). Norinco - the state armaments company - was also making a 1911 which is super popular with target shooters in the US because it was inexpensive and easy to accurize.

That said, Norinco also made a few shotguns recently (ultra 87) which developed a reputation for exploding while being shot.",16,0,1444585771,1444716262
cvvemdd,0,t1_cvvbq1n,preciseshooter,"Let me give you an example where all this magazine thing leads. In NY they decided that 10rd magazines are also nor ""necessary"", so you had, within a period of time, to sell them out of state.

Now say you have a fully matching, including the magazines, highly collectable Artillery Luger pistol, made in 1917. Guess what, now these magazines, serialized to the gun, can no longer be with the gun. So your $5000 pistol is now more like a $2500 pistol.

Now I would understand this these laws actually saved lives, but there just isn't any proof that they do. So people are asked to part with the equipment they truly enjoy to satisfy an inflamed imagination of some politician, who concocted the law and sold it to he clueless electorate, but have no effect other than showing that the politician ""cares"".",6,0,1444529705,1444716262
