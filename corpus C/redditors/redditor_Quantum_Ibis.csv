It doesn't change the fact that after *tens of thousands of years* humanity finally met up with itself again, and that time deserves to be recognized.  History is replete with territorial conflict and disease, and so while you cannot excuse or trivialize what happened, you also cannot completely dismiss the profound nature of what occurred and how it has shaped the world since. 


And it is understandably called the Age of Exploration (or Discovery), just as the term is Space Age as opposed to some reference to the Cold War which motivated it.",1,1,1444721387,1444722627
cvxw6gj,0,t1_cvxuabz,Quantum_Ibis,"I don't know that he was responsible for millions of deaths--I would have to read the scholarship on that, if it exists.   However there's no doubt that he was an awful person whose actions are only partially attenuated by the era in which he lived.  So, don't have a holiday in his name, great, which is why I suggested replacing it with *Explorer's Day*.",1,0,1444717222,1444722627
cvxvuj6,0,t1_cvxun8b,Quantum_Ibis,"Well yes, that's implicit in the statement of them being indigenous or native.  The 'discovery' that is being referenced is the knowledge of both Old and New Worlds, not either one of them alone.  That's what significantly changed the course of human history, and that is largely what is/was meant by Columbus Day.",1,0,1444716174,1444722627
cvxtzd4,0,t1_cvxt6a3,Quantum_Ibis,"The people living in the Americas were ignorant of the Old World, and vice versa.  The Vikings were the first to discover that there was another major landmass, as Columbus independently did centuries later.  These were indeed discoveries--some of the most notable in history.   


""You can't discover a continent that's already inhabited"" completely misses the significance of humans not only meeting eachother after such a long period of divergence, but also of humans finally seeing the broad scope of how our planet truly is.",4,0,1444711261,1444722627
cvxsh05,0,t1_cvxruty,Quantum_Ibis,"It has never been about venerating genocide (and I suspect you know that), but humans discovering eachother after tens of thousands of years of ignorance.  There's nothing more tragic than the disease and conflict visited on the Native Americans, completely marginalizing them.  In my opinion there should be a day to remember and recognize Native Americans, but that shouldn't mean we can't also recognize the fortitude it first took to cross the Atlantic.",1,0,1444708198,1444722627
cvxrfqr,0,t1_cvxr79d,Quantum_Ibis,If so that strikes me as a really gratuitous reaction to Columbus.  You can dislike and even abhor the person without going out of your way to specifically name a state/national holiday to spite him.,-3,0,1444706395,1444722627
cvxqsuw,0,t1_cvxqpw2,Quantum_Ibis,"Which is part of the reason why if you want a day to celebrate Native Americans it shouldn't replace Columbus Day, it should have its own.",15,0,1444705355,1444722627
cvxqhrd,0,t1_cvxqcjc,Quantum_Ibis,"I don't know why they choose to cite 'Indigenous Peoples' over 'Native Americans', it does sound clunky (and is less descriptive), but yes it's clearly a PC reaction to Columbus and Europeans.",-3,0,1444704858,1444722627
cvxoz8m,1,t3_3oie7q,Quantum_Ibis,"If it should be renamed as Columbus isn't exactly someone to venerate according to our modern sensibilities, it should have a name to fit the same purpose:  the discovery and thus uniting of both major landmasses.  That's a profoundly important time in human history:  why not a name like ""Explorer's Day""?  


""Indigenous Peoples Day"" is fine, but it's an entirely different subject.  Let it have its own day.",62,0,1444702484,1444722627
cvxosex,0,t1_cvxntbe,Quantum_Ibis,"Humans branched off into two major directions.  For tens of thousands of years, they were separated as they spread out onto the continents--until Europeans sailed to the Americas.  It was the first time that either side had *discovered* that the other existed, so yes, that's a discovery.


Of course, Columbus wasn't the first to discover the Americas, as we have strong evidence that the Vikings had centuries earlier.",20,0,1444702180,1444722627
