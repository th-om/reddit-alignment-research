The night of the 2012 federal elections after it was called for Obama I heard a Fox news commentator saying something like ""Next time we need a real conservative candidate, even further to the right! That is the only way to win."", so I don't think that lesson sank in very well for some.

Elections are decided by moderates. This is a good thing.

Your argument is ""because we don't see it doesn't mean it isn't there"" has some validity at face value, but not in this case (hence my flying crocodile...). My contention on your argument is that there is sufficient factual evidence to disclaim your argument (statistics, love them or become 1 sigma).

Please read [this](http://www.statslife.org.uk/significance/politics/2288-how-trustworthy-are-electronic-voting-systems-in-the-us) and tell me you aren't outraged that we are not pursuing a full investigation. On the flip side, [here](http://pvpost.com/2015/08/05/first-election-fraud-cases-coming-next-month-kobach-tells-nejc-conservatives-41487) is the what Kansas is doing instead.

The best example I can think of is going hunting and hearing the bushes rustle and antlers moving, then spot a mouse and pursue it instead. By my best numbers it looks like Kansas is spending about $200,000 a person (last years value) to not find voter fraud, while also spending about money to ignore election fraud.",1,0,1444353923,1444717740

cvs2fgx,0,t1_cvrlfbl,Weaselbane,"Absolutely, 100% wrong (in my opinion). 

I am in favor of decriminalizing a drug that

   a) Does not or has a very low risk of habituation. If it has a moderate or high risk of making it extremely difficult to become physically addictive, then it has is a danger to our society. We want people to be free, not slaves to a pharmaceutical company.
  b) Has a low health risk when used in moderation. If it has an injury or mortality risk increase after 20 years of moderate use, outlaw it.

cvs1mrt,1,t3_3nv0tc,Weaselbane,"NO, non-violent drug users should not be released from prison.

They should be moved to a rehab section set aside in the prison for appropriate treatment. Then released.


NO. We should not release others for download copyrighted movies and music, or vandalizing, or especially cheat on taxes. These are crimes against others, not just a crime against oneself.

YES. We should decriminalize non or low habituating drugs that do not have harmful side effects in moderation.",0,0,1444270270,1444717740
cvs1d8x,0,t1_cvrn2lo,Weaselbane,"But we have a mountain of data that links the number of people driving drunk with automobile related injuries and fatalities to others. It is a high enough correlation, and enough people were injured or killed, that as a society we decided to make the enforcement and penalties of drunk driving a higher priority for our justice system.
