That style makes for very, very good for GOP talking points.  

I'm not saying Hillary cannot provide a decent spar.  I'm arguing that Gowdy doesn't need to think fast on his feet as opposed to your statement that he cannot do so.

cvt6qhm,0,t1_cvsw8dm,thundercleese,"> You're making the mistake of conflating his ability to read a speech prepared in advance with an ability to effectively attack Hillary.  The two are completely different, and while he's good at sounding outraged, he's not so good at thinking quickly on his feet, from what I've seen.

The first link was to an effective well rehearsed speech under the guise of a press conference.

As for watching videos one through five in the dog-and-pony shows of the second link, I question if your assertion that he's not good at thinking on his feet is even relevant.   

From the short clips in those five videos, I'd suggest he navigates to never putting himself in a situation of having to think fast on his feet.

He sets up the line of questioning to ask a couple of questions in quick succession about the past statements of others and then asks a direct yes or no question. The respondents answer doesn't matter. What sticks with the audience is the first couple of inflammatory questions.

Now, you said this is your friend, and that he is making repayments in good faith.  You helped him out; good on you.  Is there a reason you cannot forgive the remainder of the debt?
