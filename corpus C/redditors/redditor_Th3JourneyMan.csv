cvx1w5t,0,t1_cvx06ie,Th3JourneyMan,"I'm just putting the analysis of McCallum together with what I know of Jimmer.

Ray can't play defense, despite his hustle factor, and doesn't have any real offensive weapons.

Jimmer can't play defense, but he could shoot the lights out at one point. We'll see if he can knock the rust off his game-time mentality quickly enough to show that off.",0,0,1444667641,1444731458
cvx1rp5,0,t1_cvwzxrs,Th3JourneyMan,"I honestly didn't know who he was before we signed him. I am admittedly excited by the potential in this pick and puzzled by the shade that gets thrown his way by people on this sub. 

Signing Ray shows the team is interested in a replacement for CoJo, and its clear Jimmer's skills lineup with that position better than any other. So, it's a worthy comparison.

I actually think it's more dubious than people think that Rasual gets signed. We're already in luxury cap space, and the Spurs historically like to play with 14 on the permanent roster. We have 16 people with some amount of guaranteed money. ",2,0,1444667447,1444731458

Vietnam on the other hand definitely got worse because of us, as opposed to in spite of. The core point in this is simple: desperate people will take whatever course they can to get out of a bad situation, even if that course doesn't necessarily make a whole lot of sense. Think of it as a greener pasture mentality.

Anyway, first you have to envision the messages of the communist vs the West supported Saigon regime. Communism tells people that they have been wronged and that they can get justice and prosperity by taking stuff from the wealthy. That's a really tempting message. Free market/liberty politics didn't have anywhere near as compelling a narrative, especially when you consider [South Vietnam's politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam#Politics). The punchline is that none of the leaders the supposedly free south had were anything other than dictators and thugs. Communism is no different, but they have a populist narrative that is motivated by the corruption of an older generation of cronies and dictators.

So, instead of making is clear that we were not going to put up with corruption, we just went along and supported whichever tyrannical flavor of the month had just seized power. This made is practically impossible for victory over communism to happen, because nobody wanted the alternative.

Secondly, American troops committed widespread atrocities in Vietnam. If a foreign enemy were in our homeland, murdering entire communities, bombing indiscriminately, and assassinating our political leaders, what would be our reaction? Resistance. With Vietnam, it's the same story, different demographic.

Put together, we created a situation where victory was absolutely impossible, because everybody either hated us directly or hated our cronies leading the South. So, we may as well have not intervened at all, at least militarily. We would have saved billions and billions in war time costs, not to mention tens of thousands of American lives  and millions of Vietnamese.",2,0,1444580314,1444731458
cvvuzp3,0,t1_cvvtgpb,Th3JourneyMan,"That's understandable.

However, you should consider the testimony offered by OP. Before conflict started in Syria, its people were becoming more prosperous, more free, and more peaceful. We have funded the rebels in Syria. Without us, it would probably be even more peaceful, prosperous, and free than when we started intervening.

Also, I'm not sure where you got the information about Syria being unable to secure their chemical stockpiles, but the rebels did not get their Sarin from a local source.

From the WhoWhatWhy article:
>According to Barakat, the Russians confirmed that the Sarin had originally come from the chemical stockpiles of Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi, who had been supplied by the old Soviet Union. Extremists in Libya shipped the Sarin chemical precursors to Turkey, where they were then smuggled across the border into Syria, according to Barakat. Assad officials were so confident that they could prove the rebels had used the poison chemicals, they allowed UN inspectors into Syria to investigate, but only after months of delay.

An interesting bit. One popular theory as to why Ambassador Stevens was allowed to die when local resources were not dispatched to support the consulate is that he was involved in running guns from Libya through Turkey to Syrian rebels. There are significant sources confirming that guns were being run. So, Sarin gas coming from Gaddafi's stockpiles is not that far fetched at all.",2,0,1444577546,1444731458

Finally, [here is a solid analysis of the events surrounding the nerve gas attack.](http://whowhatwhy.org/2014/12/01/really-used-chemical-weapons-syria/)

In short and at best, the claim that the Syrian government used chemical weapons is highly disputed. In reality, none of the known facts about the attacks point towards Syrian military involvement. ",4,0,1444573067,1444731458
