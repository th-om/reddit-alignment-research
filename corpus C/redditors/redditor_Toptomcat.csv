cvx57ad,0,t1_cvx3wvc,Toptomcat,"3:43 and 3:47: that kind of classical karate *uke* against a straight punch is a bad idea. For it to work reliably you need to be considerably faster than the other fellow, and it gets your hands out of place to defend against further shots.

3:59: It's *hard* to combine a clinch and a strike like that 'chop'. The clinch knee and osoto gari are fine.

4:28: See 3:43. The osoto gari and stomp are fine.

4:40: He starts waaaay out at kicking range and does this huge step-through to land a very short elbow. Maybe works as a sucker punch, poor otherwise. The follow-up punch is fine.

4:45: Another karate-type block in response to a punch. That clothesline is a poor throw. The follow-up punch is fine.

4:55: This isn't even a karate-style block any more, he literally just  grabbed his *uke*'s outstretched hand. Sidesteps are fine but no human being will leave their punch out for you to do that to it.

4:58: That's a technically sound mae geri, but a front-leg snap front kick is not going to be doubling someone over like that, so the follow-up twist-down throw is unrealistic. And bad in its own right, incidentally.

5:10: That kind of counterpunch is a technically sound one, and the seoi otoshi that follows it is OK, but they'd be pretty unlikely to occur immediately one after the other like that. More of uke leaving his punching arm out to be grabbed.

5:19: Another karate-style block. The kubi nage that follows is OK but the entry isn't terribly realistic. Follow-up punch is fune.

5:51: The 'use his hair against him' idea is good, as is the imprecation to refrain from 'fighting fair', but the specific hair grab is technically bad because it leaves you open for uke to punch you in the face.

6:04: Good groin kick.

6:14: Front-kicking a guy as he steps in is fine, but again uke leaves his hand out there to be grabbed and wristlocked. It's *very hard* to pluck someone's hand out of the air like that in practice. The step-over thing is a...weird...follow-up to that lock. I'm not sure if it would function or not, but it's definitely unnecessary: from that position you ought to be able to break the limb without doing it.

6:24: I won't judge him for this one since he says it's just for fun.

6:58: Another defense that isn't even a karate block, it's just plucking the limb out of midair. The osoto gari that follows is subtly wrong: he should've transferred the sleeve grip to the other hand rather than just let go of it.

7:03: Okay, for *that* kind of stupid fuckin' haymaker punch I'll give him a pass on picking the arm out of the air. It's just about the only kind of attack for which that's a plausible defense. The backfist and palm strike to the stomach are arm punches, the knee's not bad, and the strike he does to the middle of his opponent's back is worthless. It's particularly noticable in this combination that his *uke* does one punch and then stands there motionless while he does a swift combination of half-a-dozen things.

7:14: Same punch defense, and another flurry of bad strikes with a good clinch knee.

And so on and so forth. Flashes of functional stuff in a sea of mediocrity and bad ideas.",10,0,1444672564,1444721182
cvx3ijq,0,t1_cvx1wiz,Toptomcat,"These are amazing close-up shots, but I'd be kind of curious to see the setup they used to get them. How are they adding ferrofluid and dye to this system?",9,0,1444670114,1444721182
cvx2mpq,1,t3_3ogj0w,Toptomcat,"The speech: this guy has mastered the art of saying very little, at great length, with a smile.

The demo: some of it (the punch defenses, the standing locks, the 'groundwork', many of the throws) was pretty bad. Some of it (the sweeps, the front kicks) was pretty good. The rest (most of the strikes) was mediocre. He's good at making an bad technique look great with the use of a kiai, a bit of explosiveness, and a good partner.",9,0,1444668786,1444721182

cvwhyf1,0,t1_cvwhk5e,Toptomcat,"Barring some kind of unprecedented development, I think it's inevitable that *someone* will fill the niche that taekwondo's filling right now. There is an enormous amount of demand out there for a vaguely Asian-seeming form of light exercise that serves as a way to park your kids for an hour or two for a few days a week and markets itself as a way to learn how to fight while not putting its students through the necessary physical rigors. Trying to rid the world of Taekwondo McDojos is doomed to be a futile exercise.

That doesn't mean there can't be good taekwondo out there. Strive to make your little corner of the TKD world a place where people are learning something with which they can actually *fight*. Or leave, and start learning something that calls itself something else. There's nothing sacred about 'taekwondo', or any individual martial art. I don't think of myself as a 'taekwondo guy' or a 'nak muay' or an 'MMA guy'. I think of myself as someone who's interested in learning the most efficient possible way to render someone incapable of continuing to fight without the use of tools. There's nothing inherently noble or desirable about being a 'pure' practitioner of any particular style, except in the sense that it's sometimes useful to be a dedicated specialist when you happen to face a problem in your area of specialty. Are you a boxer, and in a fight where you need to punch and not get punched? Great! Are you a judoka, and in a fight where you need to kick and not get kicked? Sucks to be you.",6,0,1444616162,1444721183
