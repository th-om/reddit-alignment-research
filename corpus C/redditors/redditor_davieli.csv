cv3fk8s,0,t1_cv3ebai,davieli,"The single most frustrating thing is losing a puck under your sled. I'm not a goalie and I run into this all the time. It helps when your teammates call out where the puck is!

As for pads, yes you need normal goalie pads. The more padded legs, and padded chest. You can just ask whoever you get your equipment from that you want normal goalie pads. You want as much extra padding as you can, and it should be similar to normal hockey goalie pads. 

The only real difference is the stick, sled and maybe glove (It'll have an extra pick on it.)",1,0,1442409225,1444728202
cv2fdc2,1,t3_3l1s0n,davieli,"I think most Sanders voters realize he won't be able to accomplish everything, but it's a start. He's a politician with his head in the right direction. He's the only one saying what needs to be said about the right things.

He isn't promising the world, he's promising to do his best for those who keep getting left behind. His personal HISTORY tells me he will do this, and to the best of his ability.

That's why I'll vote for him, not because he's super human but because he cares and he will try.",5,0,1442332020,1444728202
