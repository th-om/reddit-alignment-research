cvptvas,0,t1_cvo78nq,antichristina,"I'm sorry, but that's awfully naive. A nice-sounding statement of belief in Enlightenment ideals in your constitution does not change the natural way in which power is *de facto* exerted in a state (by the government on the people) and cannot stop a sovereign entity from encumbering the population with the sorts of things sovereign entities usually do: taxation, laws, and military service. Only something stronger, read: more threatening than a state can force another state, and a superpower at that, to give up these fundamental prerogatives of the state. In which case the state loses its sovereignty and the new entity will probably find it advantageous to tax you itself.

Power rests not in words, but in institutions and in the armies backing them. The Constitution is observed to the degree that nobody can make a strong case that it is *not* observed, but that does not extend to *de facto* popular power. You have a republic, you have electoral bread-and-circuses for more seasons than is normal, you have lobbying, you can call your governor or senator or whoever, and you're treated moderately well by the government. That's what you bargained for with that constitution. The ghosts of the founding fathers won't be there to protect you from a government exercising its sovereignty on you.",1,0,1444110755,1444719118

cvo4kr1,0,t1_cvo31dx,antichristina,"States always exploit the population for their own economic benefit. In medieval Europe extractionary income (taxes) used to be the reason why European nobles could live lavishly without contributing in any way â€“ the tax burden was entirely on the poor. If you live under a state, you're a subject, plain and simple; once the money is out of your hands, your sovereign has the right/might to dispose of it however it sees fit, including spending it on charity. It's not just, and it's not supposed to be just. The government is the miner and, guess who's the mine! you are. The fact that the government has, in recent years, chosen to spend its extorted income on the poor is, if anything, laudable, although arguably an ineffective bleeding-heart measure. You know, it is in full right to just divide the money amongst its powerful. Three hundred poor people feed on what could have been someone's Gucci handbag. It's not the best thing it could have done with that sum, but fuck if it isn't charitable.

Look closer to see what the injustice to be corrected here is.",3,0,1443989171,1444719118
