> Rising rates and 
magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidification, increase the risk 
of severe, pervasive and in some cases irreversible detrimental impacts.

> ...

> A large fraction of species faces increased extinction risk due to climate change during and beyond the 21st century, especially as climate change interacts with other stressors. Most plant species cannot naturally shift their geographical ranges sufficiently fast to keep up with current and high projected rates of climate change in most landscapes; most small mammals and freshwater molluscs will not be able to keep up at the rates projected under RCP4.5 and above in flat landscapes in this century. Future risk is indicated to be high by the observation that natural global climate change at rates lower than current anthropogenic climate change caused significant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years.

> ...

> Marine organisms will face progressively lower oxygen levels and high rates and magnitudes of ocean acidification, with associated risks exacerbated by rising ocean temperature extremes. Coral reefs and polar ecosystems are highly vulnerable. Coastal systems and low-lying areas are at risk from sea level rise, which will continue for centuries even if the global mean temperature is stabilized.

> ...

> Climate change is projected to undermine food security. Due to projected climate change by the mid-21st century and beyond, global marine species redistribution and marine biodiversity reduction in sensitive regions will challenge the sustained provision of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem services. For wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production for local temperature increases of 2°C or more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may benefit. Global temperature increases of ~4°C or more above late 20th century levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose large risks to food security globally. Climate change is projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions, intensifying competition for water among sectors.

If you want to talk about these issues without coming off as a complete idiot, then you need to take the time to actually read and understand the basics. We are talking about a *high probability* of an ecosystem disruption and extinction *much* faster and more intense than the most extreme events for which we have evidence of in Earth's history.",0,0,1444681901,1444716583

Of course, because you're a) nicely domesticated and b) you've never thought through the consequences of truly resisting your government. You pay up long before large men with batons came to your house to put you in handcuffs. And they'd never need to use a gun on you because you'd never dream of trying to obtain a gun to resist government control in the first place.

> I'm perfectly happy with that.

Well that's what domesticated model citizens do, they internalise government control to the point where not only do they largely self-police, they actually defend the monopolist governments that take their money.",1,0,1444679036,1444716583

2) Regardless, seriously? Your average constable maybe doesn't carry a firearm, of course we're talking about someone who's combat trained and probably carrying at the very least a baton and mace, and will exert violence against you if you resist them. And if they want to they can carry firearms, of course if they have any real worry about being able to exert force on you there's be armed offender units with full combat gear, ranged sniper support and submachine guns. Oh and you know there's also the military. They have some guns I believe.

3) Britain and Britain's well-behaved colonies often do have police forces that don't commonly carry weapons. The reason they don't need to is that they have strict controls on firearm possession by non-state agents and docile populations who submit to this power disparity.",1,0,1444672494,1444716583

Add in class anger and it will always get watered down (rebates to allegedly help the poor for example).

cvwwghk,0,t1_cvwt7pd,jazzmoses,"Here's how it works:

1) Public hears a news story and decides big companies are scary and evil.
2) Public demands politicians Do Something.
3) Politicians create laws so they can prove to the public they've fought the evil companies and win votes.
4) Companies hire lawyers to work out how to get around the laws and maximise profits. Importantly: there are important incentives and scaling effects. A company making 100s of millions of pounds has a high incentive to exploit the legislation to the fullest extent possible, and can afford a lot of legal firepower to make that happen. Basically, larger companies, inherently more efficient than smaller companies due to more specialisation of labour, can afford more bang for their buck for with the same proportionate expenditure.
5) The laws become a competitive barrier which regressively impacts smaller firms. Small companies pay vastly more proportional to their size and struggle to compete.
6) Repeat steps 1-6.

This example extends to all sorts of legislation, including legislation specifically aimed to fight ""uncompetitive"" markets, anti-cartel legislation, supposedly abusive behaviour of companies, really any time the state steps in to ""bring order"" to the free market. It's a pernicious cycle. ",1,0,1444658266,1444716583
