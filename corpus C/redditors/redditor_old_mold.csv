Unfortunately, the mod-added animals aren't affected by my ""tame animal"" spell (from Druid Essentials).  I've just been using a [bat file](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120630141951AAVh1R5) to make them join my army",1,0,1444687795,1444725958
cvxfl9c,0,t1_cvx8d6v,old_mold,the answer to your question is yes.  He is being super unreasonable.  The fact that this bothers him so much also speaks to a certain degree of ego and insecurity on his part but thats besides the point.  Asking you to change a tattoo with such significance to you as a person is beyond unreasonable,17,0,1444687621,1444725958

cvxcfki,0,t1_cvxbvaq,old_mold,"> Why would he lie if he doesn't fear Tyrion?

Because the truth would be ""I'm having you murdered tomorrow in front of the whole city.  Dont shoot me though, that would be shitty (wink)""

 If the truth was that Tyrion would be executed, then Tywin absolutely could not tell the truth in that situation.  To do so would have been suicide",25,0,1444682906,1444725958

cvx8w9e,1,t3_3oh2lz,old_mold,"I second this question.  I've had success with going into the launcher and turning shadow detail to low and grass fade down to about 5 or 6. I also have antialiasing and ambient occlusion off.  

I'd love if someone knew some ENB settings tweak or .ini tweak to increase fps as well ",1,0,1444677896,1444725958
