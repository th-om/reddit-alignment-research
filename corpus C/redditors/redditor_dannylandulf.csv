There are very few protections for intellectual property at this point...you really may not understand just how *new* software rights are compared to other industries which have had decades to form.

Further, in the case I outlined above there *would* be a penalty...monetary or otherwise. Laws like the new trade deal are being made to make it easier for such laws and penalties to be formalized.

> But it is not illegal.

A breech of contract is, indeed, illegal. I agree that making it a criminal instead of civil may not be the best course of action...but I do, again, think some harsh steps need to be taken against a culture so set on justifying stealing.",1,0,1444537045,1444717926
cvvhncy,0,t1_cvvgn54,dannylandulf,"Think of it this way...

Let's say you are in the market to buy a new car.

You found the car you want, and have two options of where to buy it...from the dealer or from a wholesale lot.

The dealer's offers to lower his price because it comes with an extended warranty and service package. By buying it from the dealer, you are entering into a contract to also buy the warranty. If you didn't, the dealer would be losing money for no reason.

What you are proposing is the same, but with hardware makers and software companies. The only difference is there hasn't been, up to this point, legal ramifications to skipping out on the deal that got you the discount in the tech world. The current trade agreement is a first (and in my opinion needed) step to fixing that.",1,0,1444535534,1444717926
cvvg0dc,0,t1_cvve7oo,dannylandulf,"The hardware isn't magically cheaper because they feel like giving you a discount. The software companies pay real money, as a result you are offered a discounted rate on the hardware.

They can't force you to use the software...because you are not *forced* to buy the subsidized version. I know this is hard for a lot of people on reddit to get, but considering how quick the average tech user has become to steal or cheat to pay as little as possible...I'm okay with some protections going into place.",1,0,1444532362,1444717926
cvv6s12,0,t1_cvv5gp2,dannylandulf,"There most definitely is. The above example is trying to take advantage of those subsidized prices for the equipment.

I never have understood the current mood in tech that wants so hard to justify stealing or manipulation behaviors then calls any legal push back 'the end of the tech world'.",1,0,1444514927,1444717926

Looking at your post history you seem to have some serious issues regarding sex, and reddit isn't and shouldn't be your resource for working through such issues.
