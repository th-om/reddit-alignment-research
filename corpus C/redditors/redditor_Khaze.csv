cvxi6te,0,t1_cvxi1y3,Khaze,"I suppose I generally agree with you too.  But I definitely know that teachers and districts don't want to ""deal with shit.""

I am SURE kids genuinely struggle with it.  But there's also pressure to get a diagnosis for a problem child in general than to try and accommodate them.

But I agree the bottom line is schools not delivering the product they should with the flexibility they should.  I got lucky making it through (and in grad school now), by arrogance that forced me to not give up as much as anything else.  I struggled a lot.",1,0,1444691792,1444722563

cvwpdu6,0,t1_cvwnqfw,Khaze,"This is true.  ADD people have trouble switching tasks because STOPPING focusing on something can be hard.  It seems contradictory, but it's all the clusterfuck that is ADD, which is actually difficult to deal with for people who have it.  That makes it unfortunate it's so casually diagnosed, just as a way for school districts and parents to shift blame on problem children.",5,0,1444633166,1444722563
