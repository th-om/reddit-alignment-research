cvx8ixw,1,t3_3oge4d,Sebatron2,"I voted yesterday in the advance polls for the Greens, mainly because the Green candidate seemed better than the NDP one. The promise that I don't like is their support of MMP. Other disagreements I have with them are more to do with what I have stances on but they haven't stated a stance on yet.",2,0,1444677358,1444728162
cvt3gl2,0,t1_cvsztvn,Sebatron2,"1) Straight up allocating seats proportionally to the national vote isn't the only way to do proportional representation (and that way doesn't have any significant support). There are ways to combine proportional representation and local representation. Examples include [mixed-member proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation), [single transferable vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote), and simply allocating seats proportionally within regions (like [how Sweden does it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Sweden#Constituencies)).

2)A) What are you basing the whole ""Canadians dislikes leaders who get less than 40%"" thing on?

2)B) You can limit the number of parties under proportional representation via thresholds. And single transferable vote is decent at semi-marginalizing fringe parties.

3) Single transferable vote is a way to do elections proportionally and ensure that all MPs have significant local support.

The seat on the High Lords given to the Inquisition is usually occupied by the closest Inquisitor, who mainly acts as a messenger for the Inquisition. And the Inquisition doesn't really have a set command structure. Any hierarchy there is based on reputation and influence, rather than titles/ranks.",11,0,1444080083,1444728162
