Kind of. Usually they just get dumped in the main classrooms with everyone else, maybe with a bit of extra language education for a small part of the day.

What about Guatemalan kids with parents who don't? As I'm sure you expected, I'm a little more worried about them than Asians.",1,0,1444574379,1444721914

The only area you find people making this argument is prostitution, but once you look a little more closely at the data they're basing these arguments on, it becomes clear that it's a purely political argument, not a scientific one. Which should have been mostly obvious in the first place given how the economics of the argument makes no sense whatsoever.",10,0,1444512808,1444721914

>  Children of immigrants catch up quite quick and are not the disruption to you or your kids life you think they are.

I'll admit I'm not familiar with the research in this field, so I was just speaking based on what teacher friends have told me - like if you have 30 kids in class and 10 of them don't speak English, it's a lot harder than if you have 30 normal kids. They end up spending a disproportionate amount of time teaching the basics to the kids who don't speak English.

A quick Google Scholar search didn't turn up anything though. Do you have any references?
