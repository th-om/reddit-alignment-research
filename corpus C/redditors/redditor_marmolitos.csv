cvg2y9e,0,t1_cvftva4,marmolitos,"Comparing nuclear to other power sources on a basis of fatality count doesn't make sense.  This is because the probability curves for disaster are markedly different for nuclear than for other energy types.  Nuclear would be characterized by a power law curve with a much greater variance for horrific disaster, but not necessarily more dangerous or perhaps even safer with regard to lower death incidents.  Other energy types would be characterized by a bell curve with a more constrained variance to how lethal they can become, but perhaps more dangerous or having more frequent small-scale incidents.  To put it simply, it'd be like taking the well-calculable odds of losses in casino gaming and using them to gauge the inherent danger of financial or economic system, perhaps bearish in the run up to collapse or potential collapse.",1,0,1443382325,1444728948

I am not waxing utopic here.  This is basic economic history.  Yes you can find nominal claims of land ownership by the king down through his lords.

They are two different types of phenomena with two vastly differing probability curves.
