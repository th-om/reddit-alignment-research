I suppose the president could probably order bans on the selling of guns to be ignored but in order to penalize abortions, congress would have to pass a law criminalizing performing or receiving abortions.",8,0,1441720708,1444731598
cut8cyg,0,t1_cut86cn,Wyartip,"A Gensokyojin would say that their treatment of Gotenjin was acceptable and agreed to beforehand.  They would say there was an agreement that allowed New Detriot to use Goten resources as Goten had used New Detroit resources in constructing their city.  Is there no Mt. Augustan law that could possibly considered objectionable?  Even if there is not one, with the vast powers granted to the Lord Mayor, one could be enacted at any moment, or perhaps the majority of Mt. Augustans could create a law that was very objectionable to a minority.  Should they not have the same thing that was granted to Goten?",4,0,1441607262,1444731598

Augusta, which would have clearly violated Mt. Augusta's Criminal Code 500.01a and then 500.01b if it had been the other way around.  Surely it is strange that MA allowed them to join their state and protected them from being arrested when what they did was illegal had they been Mt. Augustan.  Goten has since been ceded from Gensokyo, but Mt. Augusta should change their laws if they believe their actions prior to the treaty were acceptable.",5,0,1441605414,1444731598

In fact, Mt. Augusta's mayor is even stronger that he wanted, with the Lord Mayor of MA having even more power than the Prime Minister under GTAIVisbest's New Augusta constitution, with the position's ability to freely modify or create Mt. Augustan law so long that it doesn't contradict the MA's bill of rights and the Liberalization of Autrocracy Act, compared to NA's PM being restricted to only creating laws that ""[do] not limit the power of the people to propose and approve laws... and [do] not change the fundamental structure of this government.""",3,0,1441603489,1444731598
