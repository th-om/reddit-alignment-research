cvx452f,1,t3_3oebhx,Brettster,"Let me go against the grain a little here. I think you should own and play guitar as much as you want, HOWEVER I kinda agree only in the sense that I think electric guitar sorta sounds boring on its own. It really belongs in a band or with some sort of backing, imo. You're not REALLY getting life out of that thing without a band, and you're not really feeling the magic of most electric guitar music without the subtle communication and chemistry of playing with others. It's up to taste, but I do think playing an electric yourself is just ""practice"", and the ""real thing"" is playing it in a band. It's kinda like practicing baseball religiously but never actually joining a team. You really OUGHT to, for yourself, even if it's just a hobby.",0,0,1444671038,1444718864
cvx3ucs,0,t1_cvwztol,Brettster,"I understand why some people consider it ""murder"" (I don't) or are at least uneasy about it. But I do truly also believe a huge subconscious motivational factor on the right boils down to opposition to women having recreational sex. They want bad consequences to happen to women who dare to have sex, they want abstinence to be the only remaining option. This motivation is ties together their seemingly contradictory stances behind everything from Plan B, HPV shots, contraception, sex ed, etc. It's all about preserving those ""consequences"" that they think nature is morally doling out to sluts.",-1,0,1444670601,1444718864
