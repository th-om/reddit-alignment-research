It's also interesting to see just how skeptical he was about ""secular stagnation"" in this article, compared to his current views.

This part rang a bit false to me, then I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/3oemer/blowing_the_whistle_on_the_uc_berkeley/cvwtb1e) from someone claiming to have TA'ed under him:

> He's also a bit of a dick to his GSIs: everyone at Berkeley, from fields medalists to lecturers, help grade the midterms for your large lecture but he REFUSES. Just goes home and lets the grad students figure all that out. To make things worse, his midterms are terrible and take twice as long to grade as everyone else's.

Ha ha! I guess leaving all the grading to the TAs means allowing them to ""exercise their talent and creativity"".",6,0,1444662039,1444727308
cvwpv2m,1,t3_3of723,atomic_rabbit,"> And Mr. Litanâ€™s defense that people should judge the content of his work and not its funding is also invalid. This is O.K. for a peer-reviewed journal, but not for Congress. Lawmakers hold expert hearings because they lack the expertise to evaluate certain technical subjects. They rely on the integrity of the process.

This is an unreasonable standard. This author is basically arguing that Congress should never receive testimony from experts that are funded by organizations with a stake in the outcome. By the same  token, testimony from experts with financial ties to NGOs like the WWF or MSF should be similarly excluded. But that's just silly. Congressional hearings don't consist of politicians uncritically accepting testimony from experts. These hearings are frequently adversarial; experts can be, and are in fact, challenged on the basis of who's funding their work. And senators have plenty of research staff and outside connections, with which to challenge testimony with facts and figures of their own.

Frankly, the author seems to be going out of his way to make excuses for Elizabeth Warren's bullying and the Brookings Institution's pussilanimous reaction.",2,0,1444634897,1444727308
cvvkrxc,0,t1_cvvk473,atomic_rabbit,"Yes, the Attorney General possesses prosecutorial discretion and thus in principle anyone who ""controls"" the AG can become effectively immune to federal criminal prosecution (though civil suits can still be filed). This is not special to Malaysia; the concept of prosecutorial discretion is quite standard internationally. However, in most countries there is a strong expectation that the AG is to be politically independent and should exercise prosecutorial discretion without political influence. In the US, for instance, the Department of Justice under the AG can and does go after political office holders.",1,0,1444542600,1444727308

cvunh5n,0,t1_cvuhd4z,atomic_rabbit,"Proof checking software doesn't really help with research on the mathematical frontiers. The problem is that they address the wrong bottleneck: for a human, the hard part of verifying a proof is usually figuring out the central concepts and how they are being put together, and not with following a long series of logical steps. Unfortunately, the former is what you need to be able to formalize the proof in the first place, which means that typing out the formal proof is as much effort as (actually much more effort than) just working it out normally.",7,0,1444469592,1444727308
cvun8lh,1,t3_3o70nr,atomic_rabbit,"Could you be more specific about what research topics you're dismissing as useless? Because, without more details, your over-broad complaint fails on several levels:

* It's rather common for non-experts to dismiss research topics as ""useless"" because they don't understand it.

* Funding for applications-based research already vastly outweighs fundamental research. Research grants aren't just distributed like candy; they are awarded competitively, and technological or societal benefits are weighted very strongly in selecting winners. University professors commonly spend half their time writing proposals to justify the research they are pursuing.

* At a basic level, however, there is an argument to be made that government funded research should not be *too* directly useful. Private corporations are already motivated to fund directly-applied research, so those project don't need as much aid from the government. On the other hand, government aid is crucial for ""long shot"" research programs that could provide unimagined benefits but have no immediate or certain payback. (And there are many examples of such research topics in the history of science; general relativity, for instance, was once believed to be utterly irrelevant to human experience, but half a century after it was invented, it turned out to be crucial for correct time-keeping in GPS satellites.)",25,0,1444468400,1444727308
