Yes, [the Repugnant Conclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere_addition_paradox), which certainly strikes me as wrong. This is probably the main reason why I said I'm agnostic on this issue. Unfortunately though, there's no satisfactory alternative in population ethics, and a good case can be made that the main reason the Repugnant Conclusion feels wrong is just [scope neglect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect). So I do feel that total utilitarianism provides a rational and secular basis for opposing (most) abortion, which is what OP was asking for.

> Utilitarian arguments notoriously lack a good meta-ethical foundation: What creates this moral obligation to promote utility?

There are states of the world that are better than other states of the world, and some actions lead to better states than others. Does there have to be any deeper sense of ""obligation"" than that?

> I believe most contemporary utilitarians follow R.M. Hare in trying to create a utilitarian foundation on top of Kantian foundations.

Can you elaborate on what you mean by this? This wasn't my impression of Hare. I thought his thing with Kantian ethics is he thought if you drag them out to their logical extension, they end up recommending the same behavior that preference utilitarianism does.

> A Kantian-Utilitarian hybrid position would call for maximizing rational preference satisfaction and fetuses would factor into that moral calculation only in so far as the creation of more people either pleased or displeased (rational) adults.

Would you make this same claim for the moral worth of a temporarily unconscious adult, who at the moment has no preferences?",1,0,1444669646,1444724013
cvwy564,1,t3_3of7i5,blah_kesto,"I'm agnostic on abortion, but I do think there's a very good secular pro-life argument that is missing here.

**Moral claim 1: Utility matters**. This is the well-being of conscious creatures, or the desirability of a state of consciousness. Of all claims about moral truths, this is the only one that's fairly easy to defend from a secular viewpoint. Because for something to ""matter"", it must matter *to* someone, and utility is by definition the measure of how much a being's current state of existence matters to them. It's good to have more utility, and it's bad to have less utility.

Why and when is it bad to kill someone? **Moral claim 2: a death, and therefore a killing, is bad to the extent that it reduces utility**. How do you determine the extent that a death reduces a person's utility? It depends on how long the person killed would have lived otherwise, and what their quality of life would have been. If you find a person who will live a life only of torture which is not worth living, then in that case killing them quickly is justified, because the rest of their life would have had net negative utility. Or if you had to choose between killing 2 people: a 20 year old who would live a long life or a 102-year-old who wouldn't live much longer anyway, even though they would enjoy their remaining life, it'd be worse to kill the 20 year old because that would be removing many more years of enjoyable life.

So, by extension of this logic, killing a fetus is bad when doing so reduces the total utility that would occur otherwise. And by these terms, killing a fetus is, on average, *very* bad. They are likely to have a life worth living, and by killing them you are removing more years of enjoyable life than if you killed a 20 year old.

Is it unreasonable for a person to hold these moral claims? Or does this conclusion that, in most cases, abortion is bad, not follow from those claims?",2,0,1444661484,1444724013
