cvqyx57,1,t3_3nlbwx,tomzilla,"So far everyone here, as far as I can tell, has been in support of legalizing prostitution.

I am curious to see a response to an argument against it. Here is how I  imagine some conservatives might view  prostitution. I think aside from the idea that it would become more safe and the government could monitor and regulate the industry, there is a feeling that when you make something legal you are legitimizing it in the eyes of society. Is it the message to send to children, and society more broadly, that society has condoned this behavior and allows it to occur. 

I think I may have created a straw man here because we can quickly think of examples such as cigarettes or promiscuous sex that fall into the same category. Can anyone construct a better argument to get a plurality of opinion in this thread?",2,0,1444192914,1444716680
cvpt8hy,0,t1_cvpt2qe,tomzilla,I get that it happened in Argentina (after the government defaulted on its debt I assume) but that seems like a highly speculative statement. My understanding of a 401k is that it is covers tax burden and not allowing the government to arbitrarily seize private assets  based on how bad the economy is.,2,0,1444108948,1444716680
