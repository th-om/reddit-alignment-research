cvjox3y,1,t3_3mypbn,dfgsdfg2,"Establishment going after Howard Dean in 04 for his scream. The sad thing is, if he had handled it like Donald Trump and fought back, perhaps even embraced it, it wouldn't have been so damaging. It was a trivial thing. Dean's problem was the way he responded. When you get attacked for something so trivial, you don't apologize, you double down, and counter attack. You make the attack look like a hit job by an unfair opponent, especially when its ridiculous attacks on something like a scream or personality quirk. True, this wasn't the only thing that contributed to his failure in the 04 primary, but the media really went on the attack mode for the establishment in this case. 

Compare and contrast that with trump: The media is constantly attacking him. Things that would have sunk other candidates have done nothing to trump, because not only are many of the attacks were just bs designed to take him down, but he handled them by embracing them, and thereby amplifying them, to the point where any of the attacks looked ridiculous to the average voter watching and had no effect.
