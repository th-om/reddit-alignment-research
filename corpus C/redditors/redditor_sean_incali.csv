cvxxizg,1,t3_3oh4tx,sean_incali,"Yes it's overkill. let's say you did have some contamination of pathogenic bacteria on the surface of your meat, then by touchign it with your utensil, and now washing it, and retouching it while turning it over, you do run a risk of leaving fresh germs on the surface that was on the pan. 

but the side that was cooked will be seared hot, and the germs on the raw side will be getting seared dead. 

So the chance you will contract some food borne illness from pathogenic bacteria from using the same utensil to poick up the raw meat, is vanishingly small. 

Even if it you got it, your tummy's low pH of around 2 will kill most of the germs. 

Then you only need to worry about acid resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria which are rare.

>Useful for structure (and function in an alive organism!). I'm not talking about useful for eating... we're talking about the structure of proteins as it leads to the integrity of the meat.

usefulness of whole folded proteins is a myth propagated by a lot of naturopaths which is absolutely unfounded. You were using the same rhetoric. 

>No. It's not simplifying it too much. I'm not trying to get people to pass a class in structural biology. I'm trying to introduce some simple topics and language so that non-science people can get an idea of what is going on here. You seem to be under the impression that we are talking to biology students rather than cooking students.

Nonscience people DO understand hydrolysis of collagen into gelatin. You'd be surprised at how much science non science people can understand

>I'm a biologist. I store proteins at -20C (freezer temperature) regularly, but I won't take it out of freezer unless I'm using it all. Maybe one extra freeze/thaw cycle is ok. That goes for antibodies, collagen/fibronectin, trypsin, and serum like FBS or human serum. All proteins aren't freeze/thawed but once or twice. Also, I've never heard of any lab storing proteins in liquid nitrogen. Maybe a -70/-80C freezer, but liquid nitrogen is WAY over kill. We store cells that we want to regrow later at those temperatures, and they are frozen with specific chemicals (such as DMSO) to prevent some of this from happening.

It's pretty routine to store purified proteins in liquid nitrogen where available. Some people prefer it to -80C freezers.

>Cells are 3 dimensional. Any tear in the membrane, save those which might tear the cell completely in two (which it's not doing here), you are creating pores that the cell cannot recover from. Just think about that for a second.


Pores are multiprotein channel like structures used for transport. 

You mean you make a hole, not a pore. Are you sure you're a biologist? Maybe a student?",-3,0,1444714958,1444722474

>The structure of meat is primarily made up of proteins with some fat in the mix, not very many carbohydrates (we're talking about structure, but that's true from a macromolecule stance in nutrition as well!).

Proteins are not only useful when they're folded properly. 

All proteins are denatured in the stomach where the pH is around 2. At the pH, acid hydrolysis of peptide bonds occurs, And it HAS to ccur since unless the proteins are hydrolyzed, your body has no mechanism to uptake them. ALL proteins are taken up as single amino acids by amino acid transporters against the concentration gradient at the expenditure of ATP in our small intestine. 

>Proteins are only useful when they are folded correctly. They are only folded correctly at the proper temperature. Too high or too low will unravel them. Cooking is a great way to unfold, or even degrade (tear apart) proteins, which is why meat can become more tender with slow cooking. However, in cooking we control just how much we unravel those proteins.

And the temperature does affect the folding of the proteins, but that's NOT what determines the folding of the proteins. Hydrophobicity does. As a matter of fact, dilution folding is a mechanism used by structural biologist to make proteins to solve their structures. 

And cooking does affect the proteins' structures, but that's simplifying it too much. The slow cooking methods hydrolyze one specific type of proteins called collagen which are usually found in abundance around muscles that move a lot. once the collagen that form around the muscle fibers are hydrolyzed, the fibers tend to separate from themselves. This is why meat falls apart. 

>Freezing it once will mess with the protein's folding, yes, but not a great deal. This is because there's a lot less movement at frozen temperatures so it doesn't give the protein much freedom to unfold dramatically. If you thaw it, you take these proteins that have lost their folding, and then you put them in a place to try to refold (by putting them at a normal temperature again. This allows time to keep folding incorrectly, as without the right conditions (there are only present when the meat is alive), it's never going to fold correctly. The more you freeze and thaw something, the worse this gets. That's why we generally have a rule in the lab for proteins to only freeze-thaw once, maybe twice if you are lucky.


Freezing does nothing for the proteins, but muscles structures at the level of cells. Water crystals will form at the path of least resistance which means it will puncture the cells and muscle fibers every which way the water sees fit. 

freezing and thawing affect the meat at that cellular and tissue levels, not at the level of protein molecules. That's why repeated freezing and thawing affect the meat quality. 

As a matter of fact, biologist store proteins at below freezing temp for indefinitely almost. And in liquid nitrogen indefinitely. 

>But that's not all! Also, freezing and thawing effects the fat within the cell membranes. When water freezes, it becomes less dense (it expands). So if you have a cell membrane, and it has some water flowing in and out of it, when you freeze that, the water expands, and opens up a hole in the membrane. When you do that enough times, you open up pores within the cell membrane which makes the cell essentially collapse on itself and release all of it's contents. In the lab we freeze and thaw cells over and over again until we can burst them open this way to get all of the good stuff inside.


You just tear the membrane, not open up pores in them. Cells do have pores and junctions though. 

>That ruins the structure on cellular level, and the protein stuff I was talking about before ruins it on a macromolecular level. So basically, freezing and thawing should be limited to one time only for meat. I'd also recommend not trying to freeze after you've added some time of tenderizer, be it acid like lemon juice, or some enzyme like in pineapple. It's also interesting to note that this isn't necessarily true for raw plants. They have a structure heavily built on carbohydrates (like indigestible fiber) and their cells are made with a cell wall that allows a little more leeway in the way of water movement. Just worth mentioning, though again, I wouldn't freeze thaw them that many times, as even if you maintain some structure, you'll probably lose some flavor, but who knows! I haven't done that experiment!

The enzyme you're referring to is bromelain which is a protease which actually denature some of the collagen which is why it makes the meat tender. 

And there is no such thing as ruining the meat on the molecular level by repeatedly freezing and thawing. It all happens at the cellular and tissue levels. 

And raw vegetables do far worse when frozen and thawed save perhaps some seeds, and those in heavy casings like peas and corn and things similar. The reason is because the vegetables have high water content which leaks once frozen and thawed. 

You have an atrocious understanding of cooking and food chemistry.
