cvxu4w9,0,t1_cvxd9oh,swAg_amemnon,"> Everything Kanye has put out post-Yeezus besides Wolves and his Smuckers verse have been average at the very best

Not only is this true, but I think his Smuckers verse was pretty average by Kanye standards. It fucking kills me to admit this. I think he's scared to release SWISH because he's afraid of his inevitable decline.

cvxta46,1,t3_3oj7ff,swAg_amemnon,"What is your favorite Drake project/what do you look for in a Drake project? To me, Take Care was the first time Drake really showed his full potential as an artist. He flexes all kinds of different styles on here, and some of my favorite drake songs are on here (Headlines, Marvin's Room, We'll Be Fine, UGK, Over My Dead Body). NWTS arguably does the same thing, but to me that album was a little too ""out there"" for a Drake project.",0,0,1444709785,1444732158
cvxt2sv,0,t1_cvxsgkk,swAg_amemnon,"For the most part, I agree with you. I don't think Sanders would be effective in the white house, just like Obama wasn't. But that pretty much just proves that presidents don't really have that much power. 

But what am I supposed to do if I believe that income inequality and climate change are the most important issues we face? I fail to see why voting for more mainstream candidates translates to my views being heard. Clinton can position herself to the left of Obama as much as she wants but her record says otherwise. I honestly don't know what to do other than vote for the candidate who best reflects my own views and has a record to back it up. ",1,0,1444709363,1444732158
