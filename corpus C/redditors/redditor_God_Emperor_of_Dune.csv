cvtwgjw,1,t3_3o4efs,God_Emperor_of_Dune,There are definitely a few concerns in this in regards to the internet and medication. However this does also lower tariffs and gives workers in developing countries more rights and better environmental protections. So overall I'd say there are things that can be improved but it doesn't seem as bad as the scary horror stories we've been hearing would make us believe. Am I in the wrong here? Would love to get insight from others.,2,0,1444411512,1444719126

cvrci1b,0,t1_cvrbckq,God_Emperor_of_Dune,"Yes and I'm not taking anything away from that. However, when I as a consumer learned about Amazon's working conditions, I chose not to do shopping there anymore. That is how a free market operates. We don't need a government to force these things. I think you're misunderstanding me too. I am for raising the minimum wage because on their own companies have not adjusted minimum wages to match the federal poverty line. However, if we as consumers cared enough we could put plenty of pressure on companies to raise their wages. But we'd rather pass simple legislation to force those companies to do that, regardless if they can afford it. The only reason I'm for more government at this point is because it's our only tool to fight back against corporations and greed. However, its such a hard fight because of how deeply entrenched corporations are into our government. When you expand government you also expand the opportunity to influence that government with money and favors. ",1,0,1444231666,1444719126
cvrajl0,0,t1_cvr9ttz,God_Emperor_of_Dune,"Definitely. Environmental regulation is necessary in my opinion but I would even play devil's advocate with labor laws. Our labor laws are obviously good, but why do we need a government regulating these things? Everyone in the United States has unprecedented access to information. Any company abusing workers would be exposed to the public quickly. On top of that, there's nothing stopping any private organization from starting up and creating workplace standards and auditing workplaces to meet those standards. People would naturally not work at non-certified workplaces. Regulation and government can be good when used effectively, efficiently, and with maximum informed input from the voting population. The problem is that historically government is naturally inefficient and ineffective. I believe we are seeing a shift in the younger informed populace that they want a government where everyone is more directly involved and that is a good thing. But we need to be careful and learn from our past. We all hate the cable companies but we need to remember how they got so big in the first place, and why they have stayed that big. We can't cling to government every time we need a problem solved. On the other hand, we need to completely overhaul govt and use it in the most effective ways we can: public health, education, infrastructure, and a tool to help those who need it. It should not be used as a tool by the populace to force regulation into a market that can always correct itself if given enough time.",0,0,1444228574,1444719126
cvr9owc,0,t1_cvr8v9z,God_Emperor_of_Dune,"The biggest threat to a monopoly is easy entry into the market and competition. Rules and regulations are just another hurdle to enter the market. I agree with you the problem is corruption and money buying our government. But that will always happen regardless if there is a law against it or not. One way its out in the open the other way its all behind closed doors. Placing rules on a market fix the problems temporarily, but in the end allow monopolies to exist in the first place.
