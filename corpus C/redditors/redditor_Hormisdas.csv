cvxpdia,0,t1_cvxp4nd,Hormisdas,"Ehh, I guess to just to reiterate and have it in my own comment to point at. In his comment, it was more like ""I get mad like this, so I understand why they get mad like that."" Whereas in my comment, I meant more ""There's no sense in being mad like that, just like there's no sense getting mad like this.""",1,1,1444703079,1444724246
cvx6yzp,0,t1_cvwzxeg,Hormisdas,">But on matters like gay marriage, I look at them with disgust at how they could possibly think they're remotely in the right to think about their fellow human beings that way. It pisses me off.

It is because you get pissed off at these beliefs that we can't have a nice, calm discussion about these matters.

I agree with you on your comparison. Nonetheless, treating those who are opposed to gay marriage ""with disgust"" because you think we think about our fellow human beings in ""that way"" is the same as being disgusted with people who are pro-choice because I think they support the murder of children. They both rely on false assumptions, assumptions that, no doubt, the other party would never concede and does not believe. Let's both, however, try to be better than that and not just become angry at the other side.

I simply ask that, instead of looking at stereotypes and radicals of those who hold a differing opinion from yours, you approach it with more fairness. There are reasons for people's beliefs; you may not agree with them, that's fine. But it's better for all of us if we can come to understand each other and not simply become angry that someone else doesn't agree.",4,0,1444675109,1444724246
