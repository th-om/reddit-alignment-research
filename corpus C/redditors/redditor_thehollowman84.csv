cvxs3i5,0,t1_cvxo5c0,thehollowman84,"There isn't one, Cosplay is a portmanteau made by the Japanese of Costume Play. People cosplaying are in costume, but not everyone in costume is cosplaying. 

That said specificity is usually the goal of cosplay and defines it.  If you're dressed as a Nurse you're in costume, if you're the Nurse from Silent Hill you're cosplaying.",10,0,1444707540,1444722237

Bad people run the banks. Crazy pathetic people get really mad about dumb shit and don't care about hurting people.",7,0,1444692136,1444722237
cvx5dxx,1,t3_3og3cg,thehollowman84,"Pick a ""story structure"" that you like.  It can be anything really, the  three act structure, it can be Syd Field, it can be Dan Harmon's story circle, whatever you've read about structure that's your base.

Then watch the movie and try to connect parts of the movie with parts of your favourite structure.  You'll start to see how structure works in action not just in theory.  You'll also start to see how it doesn't work and how subverting those structures can yield results.  Or failures. 

This'll give you an idea of how movies are structured which gives you an advantage.  Almost every movie you love is well structured. 

You'll start to understand that every scene has a function and a purpose. Work out what that purpose is, for every scene. 

Another thing I like to do, and I got this from John August I think? I don't remember, but you read a script/watch a  movie and try to break it down into a beat sheet.  Then using that beat sheet try and rewrite the movie. See what comes out.",1,0,1444672829,1444722237

cvx2v35,1,t3_3ogkll,thehollowman84,"Because it's constructed to be that way, it's volatile by design.  Both Democrats and Republicans make gains from the abortion ""debate"".  Almost every other developed nation has settled the issue years ago.  Most just don't talk about it anymore. 

In the US it is used to whip up the religious right and progressives. being pro choice or pro life is a core piece of both sides political identities. 

Just look how the Republicans are using it recently with the planned parenthood thing.  Just look at how much female support the Democrats have, they skew that way because of the abortion ""debate"". 

Human beings are easily manipulated, it's why advertising makes so much money and it fuels so much of our society - because it's extremely effective. By tying politics to something emotional both parties can ensure that their respective bases remain focused on the issue, and don't start asking difficult questions about why they are poor. 

It's a toxic issue because it maintains the status quo. ",-1,0,1444669140,1444722237
