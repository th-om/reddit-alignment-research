The proof that such a ""predictor"" is even possible is lacking; in fact virtually everything known about modern physics should make you think otherwise. In summary, the conclusion you ought to draw from your thought experiment is that the ""predictor"" is not really a thing.",1,0,1444452566,1444719435
cvnuai8,1,t3_3ng4o7,grothendieckchic,"Some Republican support comes from people who are going to support whoever panders to their fundamentalist christian worldview.

The rest tend to be people who essentially believe things like taxes are a kind of theft. They may believe in voluntary charity, but not in ""state mandated"" charity. This is also the explanation of the ""mystery"" of poor white republicans ""voting against their own interests"": they genuinely believe help from the state is something shameful and immoral.",0,0,1443973487,1444719435

Taking measures to protect yourself does not entail shaking in your boots 24/7...regardless of whether or not those measures are effective or even a good idea at all. There is a similar analogy you can make with condoms: some girls will be offended if you have condoms, because obviously you must have ""expected them to put out"" when really they were ""just in case"".",0,0,1443817644,1444719435

cvgzxkb,0,t1_cvfs4gk,grothendieckchic,"""We can't do X"" was your own interpretation of ""hard wired"", not a claim I ever came close to making. I already gave examples (psychopaths, mentally disabled) where the standard hard wiring seems to be absent, and so is ""falsified"". The closest thing to the sort of counterexample you are looking for would be someone who kills themselves for no particular reason, which I'm sure has happened.

No one is trying to claim what you are accusing them of. And the fact that some behaviors seem to be hard wired is hardly ""unscientific"". We are animals. Many animals behaviors are entirely instinctual and though we may seem to have greater agency it is delusional to believe, for instance, that you eat, sleep, avoid pain and seek pleasure all due to your totally spontaneous ""agency"".

Speaking of science, I'm guessing you still haven't tried the stove experiment.

cvf7du6,0,t1_cvf661q,grothendieckchic,"I agree that we have some degree of ""agency"" that allows us to overcome dumb hardwiring in favor of some long time goal, though I still think that in most cases, including self-immolation, this act which is dumb in the short term is meant to have a long term effect that ultimately is desired due to our hardwiring. A parent might ""sacrifice their life"" for instance, to save that of their child's. It's not hard to see that the underlying motivation is the same that would usually make them desire to preserve their life.",3,0,1443305288,1444719435
cvf5qr9,0,t1_cvf4zmd,grothendieckchic,"Suicide might seem like a counterexample to evolutionary hardwiring, but there are a few things to consider: 

The first is that suicide can be understood as a sort of evolutionary short circuiting: we are hard wired to escape pain, and if life itself becomes painful enough, we find a way to escape that, too.

The second is that the number of people who find life too painful to live cannot be too high (or else we wouldn't even be here). There are always extreme cases. In the same way, a few psychopaths and mentally retarded people are not a disproof that, in general, we are hard wired to have a certain amount of empathy and intelligence.

If you still have doubts about your hard wiring, try touching a burning hot stove sometime and see what happens.",2,0,1443302059,1444719435
