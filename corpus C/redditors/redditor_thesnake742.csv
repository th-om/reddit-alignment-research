cvx30ch,1,t3_3ogzb9,thesnake742,"This was taken on the Venable-Comanche Loop on 10/12. Be wary, multiple sources online put this loop at 12 miles, some a little more, but it is absolutely a 16 mile loop. A lot of elevation gain makes this a tough hike, but man was it rewarding!

cvg6e60,0,t1_cvesd1y,thesnake742,"This exactly! The weed is cool and all. But I have friends here, and some of the best hiking and mountaineering in the world is here. Supposed to be one of the best places to start a career and I just got my degree. Going where there are a lot of other people my age helps too. Get out of here with that weed talk. Although it's hard to convince people that because I'm a trimmer now. It wasn't the plan I swear.",1,0,1443387399,1444730076
