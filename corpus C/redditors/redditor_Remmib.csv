cvudd83,0,t1_cvud5ua,Remmib,"I wouldn't use the word 'hate' in regards to my feelings for Trump. I think that is better reserved for people like Hillary, Cruz, Carson, Fiorina, and other GOP glue-sniffers.

But I do dislike him, for the most part, because he is wrong about a lot of different issues and as a result has incompetent policies. There are a few redeeming things about him, in terms of calling out money and corruption in politics as well as the desire to get rid of trade agreements that are terrible for the American middle-class.

But he is all talk and no walk. There is no substance behind anything he says. ""I'm gunna be the best,"" doesn't cut it when it comes to laying out a comprehensive policy plan.

Un/misinformed people will vote for him.",8,0,1444439592,1444719090

I think O'Malley should throw his support behind Bernie and just attack the shit out of Hillary.",48,0,1444405539,1444719090

cvti9sk,0,t1_cvt8zey,Remmib,"> didn't give me a ton of confidence that he really spends a lot of time studying up on this

I don't think that is a fair statement at all.

In 2002, he was smart enough to see the consequences of a war in Iraq and predicted ISIS.
