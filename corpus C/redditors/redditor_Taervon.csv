cvsg1ym,0,t1_cvs83vi,Taervon,"Correct. This is why in other games like League of Legends, the EU, NA, and Asian servers will all have DRASTICALLY different metas, and it's why importing a strategy from another meta doesn't usually work.

Sometimes, like during ATLC when the Korean Mech Shaman list was seeing a lot of play, it does work. Most of the time, however, it falls flat.",1,0,1444311414,1444720661
cvsfpqw,0,t1_cvsevd2,Taervon,"Winrate is a bad metric for determining game balance. Sometimes it's valuable, most of the time it's incredibly misleading. Something can be utterly busted as fuck and still not have a 55% winrate. Any veteran of League of Legends, Dota 2, even MtG could tell you this.

Some of the most broken things in those games didn't break a 55% winrate, while others had 60%+ winrates in the same meta! Even recently, in dota 2 Necrolyte (Necrophos, whatever) had a 58% winrate (IIRC he had the best winrates in the entire game.) Surely he's broken then, and needs to be nerfed. Surely he's the meta, surely he's the strongest character!

Nope. Other characters were MUCH more busted. The tinker/FV meta was anti-fun as fuck, but just going off of winrates you'd never know that Tinker/FV were complete cancer. The meta after that, the Troll/Axe meta, still had Necro with an absurdly high winrate, while Troll/Axe hovered at 50% or so. I, an Axe main myself, only had about a 52% winrate with him even though he was utterly broken as fuck. The meta after that, the HO HO HA HA meta, where Sniper was god tier, still had other heroes with higher winrates than Sniper. 

TL;DR winrates mean absolutely nothing when it comes to game balance. Most of the time, what has the highest winrate isn't the strongest thing in the meta.

Also, a side note: if we're just judging winrate, Hybrid Hunter is the best deck in the game. Think about that: The deck with the best winrate isn't even in the top 3 decks.",0,0,1444310756,1444720661
cvsfb9y,0,t1_cvsd9h1,Taervon,"Which just makes it worse. Bo5 conquest with no bans and 3 decks only means that Patron and Patron Counters are literally all that's playable (outside of SEA, anyway.) My post from last week of 'druid patron handlock ResidentSleeper' refers to this, because it's what the meta is right now.

The current tournament format exacerbates the problem patron represents, it's a perfect environment for a deck like Patron.

Conquest is a good idea, but it needs more variety and it DESPERATELY needs bans. Without bans, the tournament scene will ALWAYS degenerate into 'broken deck #1 and broken deck#1's counters'. ",2,0,1444309956,1444720661
cvsf24v,0,t1_cvsb2w2,Taervon,"Yup, I would agree that the best nerf to Patron would be a new tournament format.

Ideally it would be bo7, 5 decks, 1 ban, conquest.",1,0,1444309417,1444720661
cvsf08l,0,t1_cvsdnhd,Taervon,"This exactly. It's like old Kassadin before Riot gutted him: He was utter garbage in Yolo Queue, but was ungodly broken as fuck in higher levels of play.

Instead of sticking their heads so far up their asses they could see out of their throats, Riot nerfed that fucker. I don't agree with a lot of things Riot does, but sometimes the nerf bat needs to come out.",0,0,1444309304,1444720661
