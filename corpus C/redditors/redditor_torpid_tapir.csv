I never mentioned that when I pull the battery and then start the system update android graphic comes up, then falls over saying there was a read error or something similar.   Then all the booting over stuff",1,0,1444581030,1444721854

If you try and save the world ""one equation/poem/quarter note /statue at a time you're gonna be burnt out in no time.

You're not their only hope.  They will see 5-8 other teachers that day usually.  You're really a small slice of their day time wise.  Make that slice count, but no one remembers or is affected by *every* piece of pie in their life.",2,0,1444547455,1444721854

Very often kids in this environment don't have many positive responsibilities.   They need praise and confirmation as all kids do, and usually they don't have many places to get it.

I have students assigned as door greeters, door openers (during class we lock our doors, so when there is a page from the office this student is the designated door knock respondent ), extra paper/pencil custodians, dismissal sentinels  (ensure their row has trash picked up, chairs arranged for dismissal) etc.  

They help with class room management  and make your life easier plus they are held accountable.   ""When everyone is accountable, no one is accountable"" line of thought.

Plus it can be a rotating responsible so kids get to be valued and respected and RECOGNIZED AND PRAISED in private and public ways.",3,0,1444546689,1444721854

I'm at a super title I school now.  While I don't hear them specifically talk about giving respect vs getting it (their all early MS) they behave as such.  I teach music so I have to get them to do weird things in front of their peers to eventually be successful  (buzz mouthpieces, flapping lips, sizzle, articulations speak, play sounds that sound vile because they're beginner...) and trust that it's safe.  I have daily conversations with them about ""this is a safe place"", ""when we laugh or giggle at things a lot of the time it's a defense mechanism"", ""learning can be frustrating and embarrassing.   When you were learning to walk you fell over all the time before you could go get your toy or when you were learning to talk you got super frustrated not being able to say 'I'm hungry, not wet!'"", ""x pop musician can't play the gig if the drummer and bassist are too proud to just swallow it and play"", ""sometimes playing the game is the only way to get paid"" type of stuff.  Be honest, and consistent.  You may be the only thing in their life that is.

Most important thing I've learned though is while you keep the conversation open with kids - don't beat yourself up at all if you're not their savior.  They have 5-8 other teachers per day they see just that year.  

Kids are like cats, sometimes they choose you and not the other way around.

That way all the music, geology, math, and other classes are non-objectionable but the religious class (an actual violation of law as opposed to moral, but not legal violations if tax funded) would be objectionable as it uses a facility paid in part or whole with tax payer money but the use of the classroom/instructor is paid by private money?

Is it that significant of an offset?  Meaning is the offset like a dollar for dollar value or more a cents on the dollar value?

Are there other organizations that receive state or federal funding that could receive this same logic of criticism?",1,0,1443584750,1444721854
