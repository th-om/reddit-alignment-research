cvxtt0e,0,t1_cvxsnu8,Commodore_Obvious,"It's definitely possible (I'd give it a probability of 100%) that racists hide behind non-racist reasonings that justify results they want for racist reasons.  But personally I don't care what any one person wants or intends.  I care about creating results that objectively benefit the most people in society.  If racists want something for racist reasons, but what they want would objectively benefit the most people in society for reasons beyond their ability to comprehend, I'm perfectly ok with seeing that result occur.

I want government solutions that involve restrictions on individual freedom to require a 65-70% supermajority in both houses of Congress.  That's because I only want simple problems being solved by a blunt tool like the government, and viable solutions to simple problems can easily meet that requirement.  The problem with requiring only a simple majority (or even a simple majority in the House and 60% of the Senate) is that it gives the government a mandate to attempt to solve complex problems that it really has no business attempting.

In my view, the CRA isn't that egregious of an intrusion on property rights, but it is an intrusion that attempts to solve the very complex problem of racism in the US, which even has a different dynamic compared to racism in other parts of the world.  When it comes to solving the complex problem of racism in the US, the government is Donnie from The Big Lebowsky; it's out of its element.  

When I think about how I react to being forced to do things I don't want to do, I can easily see how the CRA could have resulted in greater deterioration in race relations.  If that is true, then maybe things like Ferguson wouldn't be happening in 2014 if there were no CRA.  Maybe the US in 2015 would be a more harmonious place if the CRA never happened and that greater deterioration in race relations never occurred.  Clearly a lot of white people didn't need the CRA to view racism as a bad thing, because the CRA needed a decent amount of white support to become law.

I think there are a lot of government solutions that narrowly become law, and the reason they only have a narrow majority is that they are attempting to solve complex problems.  I think the US would be a better place for everyone if the government were more limited to only attempting solutions for simpler problems that it actually has a fighting chance of improving.  That's the main reason why I consider myself a libertarian.",1,0,1444710881,1444729573
cvxrqxm,0,t1_cvxr3qb,Commodore_Obvious,"Personally I don't mind the CRA, but I think an argument can be made that the CRA made race relations deteriorate worse than they would have in its absence.  How do you react when you are forced to do something you don't want to do?  Do you get over it more quickly or does being forced feed your resentment of whatever you are being forced to do?

The issue is absolutely not as cut and dry as ""opposition of CRA = racism.""  At the heart of libertarian philosophy is the notion that the government is too blunt or ""one-size-fits-all"" of a solution to solve the very complex problems that it attempts to solve, and that approaching complex problems in such a fashion is likely to exacerbate those problems, or cause new problems.  Some problems are very simple and a viable solution is apparent to 80% or more observers.  But with complex problems, the solution is not so readily apparent.  ",3,0,1444706951,1444729573
cvxn1ko,0,t1_cvweljl,Commodore_Obvious,"BrilloBalls has been around a while, and I'd say he knows libertarianism about as well as Sarah Palin knows progressivism.  He's a shameless partisan that is out to smear rather than inform.  If there is one broad group he hates more than libertarians, it is southerners (because that's what smart people do, generalize broad swaths of the population).  He created a subreddit a while back called /r/northernaggression, although not sure if it is still active (apparently he is starting back up with it).

> In any event, a big core of the Rand Paul voting contingent, and why Rand and Ron Paul are most at home in the South and keep getting caught doing racist things and hiring racist people, is that they are the inheritors of the paleolibertarian movement.  At its core is neo-confederacy and southern white nationalism. 

Does that even need a counter-argument, or can we agree that is absurd on its face?  He's basically saying racism is inherent to the movement that promotes liberty from government overreach, as if that can't exist without racism.  

I mean, if I want to learn what any group actually stands for, I'll either ask them directly or read what insiders have actually written.  I'm not going to Glenn Beck to learn about progressive ideals.",9,0,1444699478,1444729573
