>Clinton helped restore America’s leadership and standing in the world during a time of global challenges and changes.

No, she didn't. That statement really means nothing. What are you referring to? She accomplished very little other than minding the store as Secretary of State. John Kerry has been much more impressive in that role. Frankly I wish he was running again instead of her. 

>She built and maintained a coalition to enact the toughest sanctions in Iran’s history.

This should impress Republicans, less so democrats. I'd be interested to know what she specifically did that was essential here. 

>Played an integral role in the New START Treaty with Russia.

That's fine, but again, no signature actions here. Seems like this was a normative thing that she happened to be present for. 

> Supported the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice.

The U.S. Military and CIA thanks her for her support for her support...

> Helped avert war in Gaza by negotiating a ceasefire between Israelis and Palestinians.

And then there was a war in Gaza.

> Played a role in bringing one war to an end and planning for the end of another.

Is this seriously not a backhanded compliment?

> Secretary Clinton was critical in America’s “pivot to Asia” strategy.

How? Really? How was she critical, other than simply *being* the secretary of state at the time? The ""pivot"", while a good idea, was more branding than substance anyway.

> She worked to build the coalition to oust Qadhafi and stop massacres in Libya.

Again, just because she was in the role of Sec of State. If you don't do it well, it's not a good thing. Libya was a middling misadventure at best. 

> Engaged in economic statecraft.

WTF is this a Linkedin profile?

>Brought the State Department into the 21st Century.

I really doubt you even had an example in mind when you typed this.

> Secretary Clinton elevated the cause of women’s rights to new heights.

New Heights! Wow! That doesn't sound contrived in the slightest!

Ugh, why can't Hillary's team / supporters say anything that doesn't sound like total bullshit? Do you people have no bullshit detectors? Seriously?",1,1,1444717165,1444720095

cvx4ane,1,t3_3of7i5,thatnameagain,"I'm not sure why you are having trouble understanding those arguments, they're pretty straightforward. Seems like you are just fishing for logical inconsistencies. I'm not anti-abortion, but I can understand what the arguments against it are about. You seem resistant to the fact that most opposition to abortion is not actually based on religious rationale, but on the belief that it is a form of murder. Once you accept that, the disagreements make more sense. 

>Sooo ... let me get this straight. You are peachy with me removing a fetus when removal = death ... but have a problem with me removing it when I can remove it without killing it? .... How does that make sense?

There's really no self-evident absurdity to that assertion - quite the opposite. Some people draw the line at viability outside the womb because at that point you can potentially rationalize that the fetus is not part of the woman's body, because it is not completely dependent on it anymore. This is the difference between ending a life, and ending a potential life for many people. 

As for Romanian orphans etc etc, you are assuming that if you can compare the actual social ills of more unwanted and neglected children with the perceived social ills of permitting abortion to exist, then you will disarm that argument. But it's really an apples-to-oranges thing, and the people who believe abortion sets a bad example have clearly made their own moral judgement that that's worse than the negative social outcomes of more neglected children. I agree with you on this so I'm not going to defend that point, but it should be apparent that this is the reason why they hold that belief. 

For example, I think it's likely that people who hold this belief would bring up increased dependence on welfare/government programs as a bad thing they see dovetailing with a society that is permissive on abortion. That association or even negative connotation isn't something you or I would agree with them on, but since they are coming from a different end of the political spectrum, they are going to see problems where you don't. You say that society hasn't gotten more immoral due to abortion, but I'm sure they have plenty of examples of things today they consider immoral that they correlate with it.
