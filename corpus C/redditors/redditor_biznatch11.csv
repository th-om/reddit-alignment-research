That car was going significantly faster than the truck it was passing and there was no safe space for that car to move to the right.  In a situation like that I'd move to the right once I'd passed the truck and there was a safe gap in the right lane.

>the guy shouldn't have parked in the side of the highway

Because you know why they are parked there?  Maybe they have a flat tire or any other emergency.

>semi should have at least been going the speed limit. 

It looks like it's going about 100km/h which is probably the speed limit, and it may have slowed down because it was passing a car parked on the shoulder.",6,0,1444705291,1444721887

What does that even mean?  Fetal development is a continual process, there's no fixed point where ""all the structures necessary to survive"" have been developed.  For example a lot of important lung development occurs in the third trimester so should abortions be allowed up until 6 or 7 months of development?  The only reason a baby born at 6 or 7 months has a chance of surviving is because of modern medical treatment which is not available everywhere, and even then it's not guaranteed that they will survive.  So we still have the problem if survival being dependent on available medical facilities and even with those facilities you can only give a percent chance of survival and any cutoff for legal abortion will be an arbitrary decisions.",1,0,1444535757,1444721887
cvvh2ho,0,t1_cvvgr21,biznatch11,"Ok but what I'm saying is that ""old enough to survive independently"" isn't a fixed point.  Not only would it be different from one location to the next (depending on available medical facilities) but it's likely to keep changing as younger and younger fetuses become viable due to better medical technology.  Also there's no point at which the fetus is guaranteed to survive, at different points in development it has a different chance of surviving (eg. according to Wikipedia currently a fetus in the US has a 50% chance of survival at around 24 weeks).  Using ""old enough to survive independently"" as the indicator for whether an abortion is legal or not is therefore problematic.",2,0,1444534443,1444721887
