cvt70l4,0,t1_cvt0v6g,nickb64,">Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical. If you have no doubt of your premises or your power, and want a certain result with all your heart, you naturally express your wishes in law, and sweep away all opposition. To allow opposition by speech seems to indicate that you think the speech impotent, as when a man says that he has squared the circle, or that you do not care wholeheartedly for the result, or that you doubt either your power or your premises.

>we should not shieldourselves from the reality that we are shedding human blood. If we, as a society, cannot stomach the splatter from an execution carried out by firing squad, then we shouldn’t becarrying out executions at all.

At the same time, I think we've seen enough cases where innocent people have been sentenced to death that it makes sense to be skeptical of continuing the practice at all. Along with the fact that it's more expensive than life imprisonment, I think there is a compelling argument that we should get rid of the death penalty altogether.",1,0,1443558788,1444717724
