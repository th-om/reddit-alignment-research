cvukthx,0,t1_cvukdak,Oedium,"Considering that's a pretty clear callback to John 14 where Christ speaks of the spirit of truth as an incorporeal grace that dwells within you, and the devotion of Father to Logos and their spirit long meant different roles in revelation (as well as that being an unusual translation) I'm not sure how that presents a significant problem. It is talking about the gift of prophecy, and works like Revelation are Christian prophecy, but the idea of a prophet wiping away past canon and saying Christ was radically different from every record and student's image of him would've been at least as alien to John the Evangelist as the most heretical modern takfir would've been to Umar. I don't want that to sound brash, but there really is no room or mechanism in reading the New Testement for thinking Jesus or his closest devotees expected or thought they might need someone to reestablish their religion. One can reject the gospels wholesale of course, but I don't see a path for ""kind of"" accepting some tangential brush with the divine in reading the earliest christian witnesses without getting more problems than you solve, textually and theologically.

cvuk7qc,0,t1_cvujymq,Oedium,"There explicitly isn't an end to technical prophets in the sense of holy people predicting things that will come true, as that quote from Galatians makes clear however there is an end to revelation, christians claim there will be no new introduced holy text, nothing is being hidden by God and as long as his church remains on earth (which is said will remain until the last judgement) the full truth is there, unlike with the time before Christ's church. So if Muhammad hadn't strayed too far from Christian tradition, he mightve been regarded as a valid prophet by some Oriental orthodox, but by introducing a new holy text and saying truth of revelation was lost after Jesus, he breaks the biblical seal in the same way the ahmadis do.

cvuj5ab,0,t1_cvuflw1,Oedium,"> The Bible didn't say that about Jesus

The bible (I'm thinking of Acts 11 and Ephesians 4) certainly implies prophecy in the literal sense will be an existent aspect of the church even after Christ, but other parts like the letter to the Hebrews and especially Jesus' Parable of the Talents make it clear this is different from the heaven-infused prophets Islam extols, as Jesus is the fullness of revelation itself, the line of jewish Prophets and mandated Judges and revealers is ceased.  Galatians 1:8 unequivocably rules out someone who listens to the early christian followers accepting the Quran as valid revelation:

>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God's curse!
