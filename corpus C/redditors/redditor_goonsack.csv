You might find this interesting. 

Judge Katherine Forrest [was recommended by Senator Charles Schumer](http://www.mainjustice.com/2011/01/31/schumer-recommends-two-with-doj-ties-to-sit-on-manhattan-federal-court/) for nomination to the Federal District Court of Southern New York. This was January 2011.

[Obama then nominated her](http://www.law360.com/articles/243342/obama-nominates-6-for-federal-judgeships) based on Schumer's recommendation. This happened in May 2011.

Schumer again went to bat for her during her confirmation hearing in the summer of 2011. This is his [statement](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-112shrg76350/html/CHRG-112shrg76350.htm) in support of her confirmation:

>Senator Schumer: Katherine Forrest is also young, but an extraordinary, 
accomplished lawyer whose practice has been particularly well-
suited to the needs of litigants in the Southern District. Born 
in New York City, she received her B.A. from Wesleyan, a law 
degree from New York University Law School, spent the majority 
of her career in private practice at the prestigious top-line 
firm, filled with very intelligent, all-around nice guys and 
gals, of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where she was on the National 
A List of Practitioners.

>She was named one of American Lawyer's Top 50 Litigators 
under 45; currently serves as Deputy Attorney General in the 
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, where I know 
she is very well-regarded and has served with great 
distinction. I look forward to Ms. Forrest's transition from 
one position of service to our country to the next, and thank 
both of these nominees for putting themselves forward to join 
the Southern District of New York, the bench there.

In this same hearing, Forrest admits that she does not have a firm grasp of technology:

>Senator Franken: Ms. Forrest, I know you've done a significant amount of  work protecting intellectual property, specifically copyrighted 
work. Can you tell me about the challenges of this kind of 
work, and specifically, how do you keep up with technology to 
keep copyrighted works protected?

>Ms. Forrest. Thank you for the question, Senator. I have 
done a number of cases in the Internet space in particular 
related to copyrighted work, as well as I sort of sub-specialty 
in the choreography area.

>In terms of the technology, the world is changing very, 
very quickly in the digital environment. There were cases when 
I was early on in my career as a partner which had one kind of 
technology, **the MP3.com technology, where I essentially had to 
be tutored by individuals who were knowledgeable in that**. Those 
technologies changed. They grew over time to peer-to-peer file-
sharing technology. I most recently did the Lime Wire case, 
which was a peer-to-peer file-sharing technology. To keep 
abreast of technology I think is something that is a bit of a 
challenge.

>**However, I do not have a technology background.** It is 
something which judges can understand and can learn. Certainly 
as a practitioner, I was able to do so by speaking with people 
who were knowledgeable in the field. There is an awful lot of 
information that is available to people right now in the 
technology area that assisted me with my cases, and if I were 
confirmed as a District Court judge I would intend to bring 
that digital experience to the bench, and also to keep abreast 
of the technologies as they continue to develop. No doubt they 
will; it's a very changing, fast-paced environment.

and admits she has meager experience with criminal law:

>Senator Grassley. OK. And my last question will go to Ms. 
Forrest. Again, this question deals with lack of experience, 
but in this case in the area of criminal law. **According to your 
questionnaire, 98 percent of your career has been in civil 
practice.** If confirmed, how will you prepare yourself to handle 
a variety of criminal issues that a District judge confronts? 
**What assurance can you provide future litigants that your 
judgment is sound and well-informed and fair when it comes to 
criminal law?**

>Ms. Forrest. Thank you for the question, Senator. **It is 
true that the majority of my practice was 20-plus years doing 
complex civil litigation.** However, I have been a Deputy 
Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the 
Department of Justice for now **8 months. During that time I run 
criminal and civil operations.**

>As the person in charge of criminal operations, I oversee a 
docket of over 100 cases where I'm responsible for all aspects 
of the investigation of the matters that come before the 
Division. I deal with plea agreements, I deal with sentencing 
guideline issues. So **I have begun the process of educating 
myself**. I do understand very seriously that there is more to be 
learned. That is always the case when you are entering into new 
areas of the law. My work ethic is such that I have no doubt 
that I will be able to acquire the skills necessary to be able 
to oversee all aspects of the criminal matters that come before 
me.


Now here's the really interesting part. Just days before Forrest's confirmation hearing, Chuck Schumer [very publicly called for Silk Road to be shut down](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Schumer-Calls-on-Feds-to-Shut-Down-Online-Drug-Marketplace-123187958.html).

Fast forward to October 2013, Ross Ulbricht is arrested and charged with being the Dread Pirate Roberts. And whose courtroom does this case end up in? Katherine Forrest's, naturally.

One would think that it might present a huge conflict of interest, having a judge preside over a case in which a powerful US Senator, who is *this very same judge's political patron*, vocally and publicly called for federal agencies to go after the Silk Road. 

And this is to say nothing of Forrest's own insufficient qualifications for presiding over such a case, which she admitted to in her confirmation hearing.

I believe Ross Ulbricht got railroaded by a political machine. I was not surprised in the least to hear that Forrest gave him the maximum sentence available. But I do consider it a miscarriage of justice.
