cvs75lq,0,t1_cvs4fjb,lefferts,How much does the Gillette power cost you and how often do you replace it? I've had success with headblade what's why I ask. ,1,0,1444281743,1444727558
cvs74of,0,t1_cvs1ese,lefferts,I've been using headblade for years and really like it. Which Gillette razor do you use for your head? How much to you pay for it? And how long does it last considering you shave everyday. ,2,0,1444281674,1444727558
cvs732u,0,t1_cvs50ut,lefferts,"I switched to a DE razor a few months back. I've been using a sampler pack but honestly every brand seems the same. Do you like Astra? Can you link me to where you're getting them for five to ten cents per blade? Do you honestly use a new blade for every shave? For everyone else, how often should the baker be changed? Also, I've always wondered, can I flip the blade over to the other side?",1,0,1444281557,1444727558
