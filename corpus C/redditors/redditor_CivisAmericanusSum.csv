cvsr2pp,1,t3_3nyul1,CivisAmericanusSum,I believe Malcom X once credited learning debate in prison with helping him turn his life around.  Debate is a way to settle disagreements that doesn't involve your fists.  I don't see any downside with teaching prisoners how to articulate their views and use words in a way that can avoid violence.,3,0,1444328281,1444719910

cvigu7g,1,t3_3mv339,CivisAmericanusSum,I think the dichotomy is a false one.  The purpose of a republic is not solely to represent everybody's views but to prevent one person or party from completely dominating society.
