You can go get a federated XMPP account with DuckDuckGo today, grab one of the extremely few apps that support Jingle, and make video calls with it. Literally nobody is developing working Jingle clients because, one, nobody is using an XMPP account anywhere, and two, because XMPP is a mess and a half to implement.",3,0,1444711000,1444728528

That, and this is not 1970. You do not need a waged position to make money anymore, and I would absolutely say having a teenager work a part time waged position is detrimental to their education by eating up so much of their time when they could be doing anything from mowing lawns to fixing fences to Amazon's Mechanical Turk to opening an Etsy shop instead with hours that can match their schooling workload.",1,1,1444679588,1444728528
cvx9zz2,0,t1_cvx4eh3,Xanny,"He probably means an objective measure of what the majority of people want to see companies profiting by. IE, Exxon and Apple are ""unfair"" because they hoard money and have a huge market valuation from having nothing to spend their profit on, because they have no market forces pressuring them to grow or expand or diversify, especially if the controllers of the corporate bank account (ie, shareholders, CEx reps, higher business managers, the accountants) have uncertainty in the market outweighing profit opportunities.

Some people would consider that concentration of wealth as being distortionary to growth elsewhere, since its basically people buying stuff from a company who pockets the profit and does not effectively recycle that revenue back through the economy at a comparable monetary velocity. It slows down the market if enough businesses do that, and when the go-to behavior in a market is to buy your competition and hoard your profit, it impedes overall growth.

At that, I agree with economists that corporate taxes are bad and imposing one now would be treating  symptom rather than a problem which is the corruption of the state at the regulatory and trust-busting level that breaks the free market so those who control vast sums of wealth in equity like Exxon, Walmart, and Apple can use the violence of the state as their tool of growth rather than through market competition.

But taxing the companies more would just drive them to relocate elsewhere while continuing to buy politicians at all levels of government.",1,1,1444679470,1444728528

The same would happen to free public in state universities like Sanders is advocating - they could not spend erroneously if they are on a fixed income from the fed.

That in and of itself can and would lead to a whole host of other problems, mostly the same issues found in current day public primary schools (underfunding, staff cuts, poor access to student resources, etc). Those kind of issues would not manifest overnight (since you would just in the year you pass free tuition just change the check from the students pocketbook to the feds) but in the long run the way the Dept. of Education funds state primary schools through horrible monsters like NCLB would manifest in a federal free state university program.

Basically what I am saying is you can absolutely expect costs to be controlled under a federal state university program. The problem is that program would then have all the issues of federally controlled institutions, like primary schools and veterans services.",1,1,1444679102,1444728528

I wouldn't make the requirements absurd - making the vet minimum like 60 would be enough to force fresh 50s to get *some* other gear before they can make the mistake queuing when undergeared, but it also means if you are good enough to do it the ilevel stat isn't going to just hold you back.

The only nuances are technical, and if they opened up the AH up to more modding you could mod the problems out.

> terrible nameplates/fonts and so on

There are actually a lot of fonts in the game files I found with optiplates. Yea, saying ""get addons"" is not *great*, but they do exist to make the nameplates / UI a truckload better, and I'd rather see resources invested in fixing the major bugs (account wide resources, pvp xp, my scanbot taking 5 years to update research progress, the rune revamp) than to tweak the UI when working fixes do exist.",2,0,1444588518,1444728528
