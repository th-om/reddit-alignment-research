cvuc252,1,t3_3o539q,Disheveled_Politico,"I'm a transplant to Jersey, but I grew up in Colorado and spent a couple years in Montana. Food is honestly a big one. Denver has good Mexican food, but beyond that it's pretty mediocre compared to NJ. 

I think the people here have bigger egos, but that they are more genuine. I dislike more people here when I meet them than average, but I also REALLY like more people here when I meet them on average. 

The lack of open space. In Montana you can get on the highway and see mountain ranges that are miles away. You can see the horizon in all directions. It's magnificent and breathtaking. Here, the trees, buildings, lack of elevation changes make everything feel really cramped. 

A lot of people out west identify with their state or even region in a bigger way than here where I see a lot of reference to your town or the continual North vs. Central. Vs. South Jersey. It makes sense considering how many people are in NJ compared to western states. 

Did I mention the food? You've ruined me for pizza anywhere else. 

I really like it here, it's my second time here and even though my job keeps me moving a lot and I probably won't be here much longer, I always stick up for NJ when people act sorrowfully for my having lived here. Like those in my adopted state, I tell 'em to go fuck themselves. ",26,0,1444436992,1444730740

cvk9zjm,0,t1_cvjlp4j,Disheveled_Politico,"I'm a dyed in the wool progressive and a ""Catholic"" who despised Benedict's largess and corruption and really appreciates Francis. 

No one, especially the pope, is going to fall entirely into one political camp. Hell, I work in Democratic politics and I'm pro-gun and have a very complex relationship with abortion (being pro-choice is my litmus test to support a candidate, but I still think it's a horrible option, it's just not my place to judge.) 

Progressives love him, rightfully so, for meeting with the poor, the downtrodden, those who have made poor choices. His meeting with someone who is standing up for her religious views, misguided as you or I may see them, shouldn't surprise or upset anyone. 

He isn't our standard-barer. If anything, it shows that using the opinions of a religious leader to justify your secular public policy is a bad idea, something that Catholic Republicans are learning for the first time. ",2,0,1443683530,1444730740

You said that Dixiecrats threw in the towel after the 1972 election. As everything I've said above proves, that is simply incorrect. Mary Pryor, Mary Landrieu, Zell Miller, Ernest Hollings, all of them were conservative Democrats who won well into the 90s and 2000s. ",1,0,1443031805,1444730740

Alabama: 1997
South Carolina: 2005
Georgia: 2005
