If you follow that logic, who the hell cares what any one thinks about any subject? I'm not saying he was THE authority on the Constitution but his opinion was pretty valuable and deserves consideration. ",1,0,1444219296,1444718952

cvqwfgr,0,t1_cvqvxm6,sodemo1864,No. Neither one of the issues mentioned in my previous comment matter to me at all. I was just explaining my opinion that Trump will say whatever aligns himself with his voter base. His voter base being conservatives who blame establishment Republicans for the current state of affairs. Jeb Bush is an actual politician and is smarter than Trump. He wouldn't say anything that would distance himself too far from establishment Republicans. ,6,0,1444187619,1444718952
cvqv28g,0,t1_cvquh4f,sodemo1864,"I agree with you there. That's why I referred to myself as a dumb ass. I knew the law and I intentionally broke it. Then, I suffered the consequences and got my life together. But, just IMHO, I believe that the emotional appeal is most effective when used within the context of personal responsibility, which I hope I've done. Many use that emotional appeal but also blame the laws and don't hold themselves accountable. ",6,0,1444185116,1444718952
cvqu7h8,0,t1_cvqtuph,sodemo1864,"Agreed 100%. The system is truly broken and I have first hand experience with it. Got a simple possession charge when I was a dumb ass freshman in college and, not only were my student loans withdrawn, but I was kicked out of my dorm and the added court costs and probation expenses. I take full responsibility for my actions but it was a first offense for a small amount of weed and it took me two years to get back in school. ",7,0,1444183599,1444718952
