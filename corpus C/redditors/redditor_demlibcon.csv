cvu13mv,0,t1_cvu0hxg,demlibcon,"I would not have a problem giving my name if I had already announced. At this point, we are still in discussions with a Liberty PAC and mulling the commitment needed to run a campaign focused on winning and doing something that really has not been tried yet. I am open to any questions you may have. ",1,0,1444418417,1444726908
cvtygq6,1,t3_3lh64n,demlibcon,"An idea I have flirted with for some time. And it seems it may actually be something I ultimately test. I find it more appealing on a local/state level than a national one. I see you getting more traction there. Take a state like Texas for instance, where a moderate Democrat can end up sounding like a libertarian in some respects. 

I was approached by people within the Democratic party, after I ran as a Libertarian, in a district I have lived most of my life, that has not seen an opposing candidate since 2010. We did surprisingly well for a Libertarian, finishing with the highest voting percentage in the county for a third party candidate. Our platform was not traditionally Libertarian in many respects with regards to education funding, mental health funding, housing, health insurance, etc. We fashioned ourselves as Classical Liberals in the newer tradition of what is referred to as ""Bleeding Heart Libertarians"" or the ""Arizona School""--one of the philosophers wrote a book that largely informed our political philosophy, ""Free Market Fairness"" by Prof. John Tomasi.

ctrnnar,0,t1_ctovlg4,demlibcon,"That's normally true. However, there is a tradition that rest in the more classical liberal strain of libertarianism, that has come to, in more recent times, philosophically argued for a more robust defense and implementation of social justice themes via Rawlsian conception of social justice.

ctn2kzb,0,t1_ctn1j9v,demlibcon,"Good book on the subject is, ""Twilight of the Texas Democrats"" and ""Red State"", very good books that tell the history. Good stuff.",1,0,1438366954,1444726908
ctn2dmg,0,t1_ctn1j9v,demlibcon,"Initially, yes. But as time went on a lot of those who might have been more like moderate Democrats of the Rockefeller Republican variety were eventually squeezed out. The party modernized before there was sufficient voters to offset the loss of the old southern Democrats with, yes, untenable positions on social issues. And subsequently, after the first Republican Senator was elected, then Texas AG Hill, lost to Republican Bill Clements, who the Democrats courted to run previously.

And the ""flavor"" I speak of is in regards to Democrats and not Republicans. Democrats here can be more conservative than in a very liberal state. If you are to build coalitions to win in non-urban areas, that is the only way to really do it.",0,0,1438366659,1444726908
ctn1a8z,0,t1_ctmzlny,demlibcon,"Well, the libertarian would be a Democrat. So there is not an advantage over a Democrat per se. What advantage there could be is in being more of a Bill Hobby Democrat versus say like a Cali or New England progressive Democrat. Texas has always had its own flavor. The history of how the Democrats lost their nearly a century plus monopoly over the state has much to do with what a libertarian Democrat would bring back to the party.",1,0,1438365123,1444726908
