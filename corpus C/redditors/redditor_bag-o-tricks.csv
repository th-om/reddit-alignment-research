cvrcvtu,1,t3_3nujxm,bag-o-tricks,"I might suggest that many households don't have the time anymore. There used to be a lot more single-income families, say, forty years ago. I know when I was growing up, my father worked and my mother was very involved in us kids' schools. When she also went to work, she had to drop her involvement with the PTA and other school related activities. Changing demographics of families with children has to have some impact on the number of parents involved with the schools. ",9,0,1444232251,1444719821

cvnxwid,1,t3_3ng9vy,bag-o-tricks,"How about letting actual historians write the books and recommended curriculum for students?

cvmyc3c,0,t1_cvmw02l,bag-o-tricks,"It's sort of like a free market in that better schools draw people to the community. If local communities have poor schools, people won't want to live near them and the local economy would suffer. It would make sense to better the community by having strong public education in the district. One of the barriers to overcome is lack of involvement by local residents in their communities. More involvement equals better understanding and more accountability to school boards and local politicians. I think too many people have thrown up their hands and relinquished control to the bureaucracy instead of fighting for what would really benefit them. Sadly, what we have now is fairly entrenched.

There are so many barriers to fixing the mess though. Back in the single-income days when mom (or dad) could actually spend time trying to better their school and community, it was easier to do. My sister lives in a very well-off community and their schools are top notch. The area is made up of a lot of single income families (doctors, lawyers...etc) and their schools reflect the involvement of parents. As a school board member, or a local politician, I would hate to have to face the wrath of those parents. ",1,0,1443896446,1444719821
