And I don't care about cars or saw any of the previous movies besides the very first one. If they can keep coming up with fun set pieces, I'll keep watching them.",10,0,1443477519,1444724471

cvddsp0,0,t1_cvda34f,earthxmaker,"A lot of people only pay attention every 4 years during the presidential cycle as well. If you vote for local and state officials who fit your ideals more, some of those people will filter up as time goes along. It's more effective than just expecting a presidential candidate who perfectly represents your beliefs (which will never happen).",1,0,1443151323,1444724471

cvd1dnh,0,t1_cvcxmhl,earthxmaker,"And also it's a problem of a lack of spectrum. Yes, some women could enjoy using a hyper-sexualized representation at times. However it's a problem when that's the overwhelming majority of the depictions of women.",6,0,1443129893,1444724471
cvd0cnb,0,t1_cvcxggi,earthxmaker,"Jewish, Japanese, Black, and Native American caricatures used throughout history aren't real representations of those people either. However they perpetuated social problems and feelings towards those groups. Labeling someone as a fictional being isn't the same as maintaining stereotypes and negative images of groups of people. Though calling people demons, witches, ect, has been used many times in the past as well.",5,0,1443128325,1444724471
cv9mi8h,0,t1_cv9hqvr,earthxmaker,"I love it when fans think they know better than the coaches and staff who watch their players everyday. If they thought he had the talent, they wouldn't just buy him out and cut their losses. Sure, some players turn it around but it's rare. It's like all the people who clamor for Tebow.",12,0,1442880304,1444724471
cv23eja,0,t1_cv235xn,earthxmaker,Because that's Trumps persona. The public view him as larger than life. Other candidates can't get away with the same things he does.,11,0,1442298219,1444724471
cuyv8ue,1,t3_3kncg7,earthxmaker,"I would guess the main problem you'd run into are the cards. A lot of them are borough and KoNY rules specific. Cards add a lot to both games, but I spose you could made due. Other than that I can't think of anything that would be too hard to paste over. ",7,0,1442053624,1444724471
