cvuu8hj,0,t1_cvulsic,LeeWilkesHinckley,"Star Wars was sacred to a lot of people pre '99. The amount of hype for episode 1 was insane. When it finally came out, it was an absolute shitstorm that decimated all of the good things the original trilogy had built, and Jar Jar represents that more than any other element of the movie.",0,0,1444491658,1444719170

cvti1kz,0,t1_cvtf1bo,LeeWilkesHinckley,"I completely disagree with you. I've known a few people with wartime PTSD and they're reactions were based on triggering events tied to their experience in the war. Bubbles' reactions are simply in response to things she doesn't like people saying to her. If Jeph is trying to use PTSD as an excuse for Bubbles nearly killing Faye because she didn't like her party very much, I'm going to be extremely disappointed",11,0,1444378785,1444719170

cvr54nx,1,t3_3nsm8e,LeeWilkesHinckley,FWIW my in-laws are Central American and they despise Rubio. Anecdotal I know but I don't get the sense that they or their family and friends would shift right. Too much loyalty to the democrats for their positions on immigration and workers rights.,4,0,1444215939,1444719170
