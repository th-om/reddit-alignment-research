cvq621g,0,t1_cvq1g0q,Humanatee69,"I agree with you. Lakes are swimmable but the big ones take forever to be comfortably warm. Kingston is pretty far south and as I said, my friend fell in the lake while kayaking and we had to go through hypothermia prevention procedure.

Smaller lakes warm up and the prairies are a different climate. In the end I think we as South Ontario residents know better than most of reddit anyway haha.",2,0,1444145807,1444726854
cvq0p2a,0,t1_cvq0990,Humanatee69,"What? Here in Kingston lake Ontario freezes over every winter. People used to drive over the lake freeze to Wolfe Island which is about 7-10 km away depending on where you are on the coast.

That said, can confirm lakes are cold as fuck even when its warm out. I think the lake is warm enough to swim in like 1 month a year. I fell in during June and hypothermia was a real concern.",6,0,1444135988,1444726854
cvbzg6o,0,t1_cvbwa76,Humanatee69,"Ter Stegen? He'll definitely be better eventually but MtS is not nearly is reliable between the sticks as Handanovic. Bravo is definitely good, but I don't think many people would say he's better.

I feel like you need to watch Inter sometime. Handanovic is right on par with DDG, Lloris and Navas for me. The man is unbeatable at times. Best penalty saver in the world, excellent command of the box and world class reflexes. 

I wish Inter would get their shit together so Samir can show off his talents in the Champions League. Im not trying to say Handanovic is the best in the world or anything, but to say he is clearly out of the top 10 is simply false.

In short, people aren't happy. Abe's approval rating is absolutely plummeting and Japanese people are outside protesting it. At points yesterday the protesting crowd was as large as 30,000 people.

The largest push for this bill is coming from Shinzo Abe and the United States. The Japanese people overwhelmingly oppose it.",1,0,1442805196,1444726854
cv8n6hd,1,t3_3lir1j,Humanatee69,"People seem to misunderstand the bill being passed by Japan. This is from the Japanese constitution:

>...the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. (Article 9)

What is being passed is a reinterpretation of how Japan can protect its own land, which is what their military is permitted to do. The bill looks to enable Japan to go overseas if it is necessary to protect its own country. Attacking or invading other countries or joining unrelated conflicts is still forbidden.

On top of this, over 2/3 of Japanese people aggressively oppose this. I was skyping my father in Tokyo yesterday and could hear the protesters despite the fact that he lives quite a few blocks away from the DIET Building. 

All this to say, I could see Abe weaseling this bill all the way through, but don't expect it to lead to war in East Asia. There will be tons of posturing from China and the Koreas regarding this move, but armed conflict is still very unlikely. It is sad to see a core component of the Japanese constitution reinterpreted against the will of the people, but this is a far cry from the reemergence of a warmongering Japan.

**EDIT**: [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=396&v=9GL6E8ETkbE) is a pretty informative video on the matter that was posted earlier today on reddit.",1,0,1442804241,1444726854
cv61a7u,1,t3_3l90vb,Humanatee69,"You need to consider where Trump is getting his support from. His base isn't one that cares about policy or experience, they simply sympathize with him as an anti establishment candidate.
Therefore things that would end other campaigns actually enhance his. 

What do his supporters want? An entertaining, anti-establishment candidate who speaks candidly. That is exactly what he did and his supporters will be invigorated by it.

Anybody who has studied any politics at all knows Trump would be an absolutely abysmal presidential choice and that has been clear since he started running. However his 'gaffes' are actually resonating with a sizeable group of people and if he buckled up and started acting like a 'politician' now he'd likely lose support quickly.
