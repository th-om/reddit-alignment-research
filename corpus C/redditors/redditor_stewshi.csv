They didn't even consult state law enforcement they just passed a law that dosent work. Of they had listened to anyone at all they wouldn't have come up with the steaming pile of dog shit that lost them the state congress and they barely maintained a one seat majority in the state senate. 

You can look all over Texas where some of the most relaxed gun laws in the nation and the have some of the lowest gun crime rates in the nation. Guns don't create crime they are a tool used either by the good or the bad.",1,1,1444714501,1444717810
cvxuz1i,0,t1_cvxuv5w,stewshi,In colorado thwy tried to help craft the law and thwy were shut out by the Democrat majority. Due to their refusal to listen three of them lost recall elections. They tried to help with the National ubc law after sandy hook they refused to compromise. Also most of us feel like these laws aren't to protect us but to hinder our rights based off of what people do illegally ,1,1,1444713671,1444717810
cvxutnd,0,t1_cvxuj6h,stewshi,But this is why pro gun people are so unwilling to compromise. If your willing to pass a shitty law that makes me a criminal because I let someone handle my rifle or take a few shots off of it then why should we budge in our positions. Op wonders why his friend is obstinate in his stances and this is why. There is a clear lack of understanding coming from one side and that side is also pushing for laws. I can understand why people fear these tools and I can get behind some of their laws if they were willing to compromise they would get things like ubcs.,1,1,1444713283,1444717810

They tried to ban cosmetic features and gun companies came out with a way to maintain functionality and circumnavigate the regulations. 
One reason alot of people don't want ubcs is because they are so poorly written that handing a firearm to another person without a background check. Alot of people that are pro gun offer the compromise that if they open up the background check system to private citizens. This has been refused and it is a great compromise. It gives anti gun the ubc and it allows pro gun to maintain privacy and avoid the very expensive transfer fees. I live in colorado and it would cost me an extra 35 dollars to sell my private property.

cvxtyjc,0,t1_cvxtr8z,stewshi,I like to look at places like Chicago and d.c strict gun laws high crime. Are their other factors that play into it yes but from Oct 1st to Oct 7th Chicago had 44 people wounded in shootings and 6 murders. How are strict gun laws not curtailing this. I understand their are socioeconomic factors at play but this proves that stricter regulation aren't the panacea that people toute them to be. Oregon has universal back ground checks yet this still happened.,1,1,1444711210,1444717810
cvxtn0g,0,t1_cvxsbyx,stewshi,It can't be proven that a single gun control measure has saved any lives.,1,1,1444710520,1444717810
cvxtm4w,0,t1_cvxsc3s,stewshi,Well if you look at the history of gun control it started with the machine gun ban in 1989. They took away the right to own or manufacture a machine gun and gun owners got nothing in return. Then the assualt weapons ban of the 90s till 2004. That came with a hole host of regulations. They have made it so that supressor need a special licence to own or create short barreled rifles have to be registered and this is only  done through a long process. This creates an artifical demand and makes these things cost a whole bunch. They add regulations to firearms and never take any away. When they pushed for ubc after sandy hook they tried to haggle in a delisting of supressors but the antigun crowd would not compromise or budge. You also have politicians like fienstien that really want a full confiscation.  Or in colorado were they passed a bunch of ineffective laws that accomplished nothing but getting 2 senators recalled and forcing a third to resign. With the large grabs and the rhetoric of the antigun crowd it has made gun owners very uncompromising.,1,1,1444710472,1444717810
cvxs856,1,t3_3ojhq9,stewshi,Alot of gun owners feel like that they always get the short end of every deal when ever they increase regulation on firearms. So most of us have developed a zero tolerance position towards any new regulation.,1,1,1444707762,1444717810
