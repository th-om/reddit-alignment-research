cvwu1ue,0,t1_cvwp88x,jedify,Haha glad to know at least someone appreciates it.  I've come to realize that perhaps the reason people cling to this one in the face of personal experience and common sense is they're trying to convince themselves that alcohol isn't really *that* bad for you? ,1,0,1444652174,1444724512
cvwjw25,0,t1_cvwde3e,jedify,"Ok, forget about french fries. The sodium contribution from msg is very minor compared to salt in regular food. In fact, it can reduce overall salt use. Salt is often used as a quick way to add flavor to food that needs it. Msg adds savory flavor, and can reduce dependence on salt in cooking. If anyone is that sensitive, they probably can't eat most non-msg restaurant food. ",1,0,1444619647,1444724512

>Dehydration, the source of most hangovers too

As you said, dehydration symptoms from trekking disappear when you drink water. Hangovers don't.  Relax, just trying to correct a myth here.  And you can't just quote any old unnamed source that supports you.  There's  plenty of bullshit on the internet. ",1,0,1444612444,1444724512
cvwcs11,0,t1_cvwccan,jedify,"Have you been dehydrated without the use of alcohol? The effects don't last the whole next day.  Dehydration doesn't help, but are you really telling me large amounts of an acute toxin has no bad effects on your body different from a nontoxic diuretic?  Are you really?
