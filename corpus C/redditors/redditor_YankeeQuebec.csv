And the last major shooting, the shooter posed with pictures of him and a .22, and there were reports of the gun being a .22, but the case is locked down extremely tight, but it possibly could have happened with the guns you don't think should be banned.",1,0,1444540652,1444721903

cvvjqj2,0,t1_cvv9xbj,YankeeQuebec,"During the time of our Revolution, private citizens were hired by the government to specifically because they had more, and more powerful weapons than what the government could get.


Actually, back then, private citizens at the time had the most advanced weapons of modern warfare. Single people possessed the single most powerful weapon at the time, capable of barricading entire countries, and bringing their financial markets to their knees.

You can chime on about, ""but but but, it was just a musket"", let me remind you that one of the main reasons the Revolution was won by the Colonies, was because our private citizens literally developed and used the rifle, a weapon many time more powerful and accurate than any musket even of this day. And, the US government specifically recruited citizens with rifles, to have the technological advantage of the largest standing military in the world.",2,0,1444539868,1444721903
cvumdg1,0,t1_cvugxwt,YankeeQuebec,Is his post going to mention the 90-95%% mortality rate that Salmon have faced over the past few decades so that cities like Seattle and Portland can call themselves green? ,2,0,1444464200,1444721903
cvumbac,0,t1_cvu8mnc,YankeeQuebec,"They were exposed to the concentrate, not the dilute form they would experience in the actual river environment. That is a huge difference.

I have no doubts that urban runoff might be the cause of Salmon deaths, but this study is pretty much a bunch of BS that is already known. IE, knowing that runoff fucks fish over, but the way they did the study is only confirming the already confirmed theory that roadway runoff can cause problems for fish in an urban area. And, these problems have been studied as far back as the late 80's and early 90's, and is what pretty much made Oregon and Washington stop using salt on the roads in the winter.

It just seems like this study wanted to find a cause, and did everything in their power to prove their theory right, including not using real world reality.",1,0,1444463929,1444721903
cvu4n98,1,t3_3o3s2c,YankeeQuebec,"[I've read the study](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2451727-spromberg-et-al-in-press-j-appl-ecol.html) But all I see is they exposed the Salmon to 100% run off, and filtered run off, and concluded that filtered run off is better.

Not exactly sure what this study is saying other than if directly exposed to 100% urban roadyway runoff for 2.5 hours, they can die. It's like saying if a human is exposed to 100% car exhaust, they can die in as little as 3 minutes.

I'd like to see if they measured the water quality of the streams/rivers during run off events, the study didn't say the did, because just throwing fish in extremely shitty water in concentrations they will never directly see, is a pretty disingenuous way to come to a conclusion.",6,0,1444423865,1444721903
