If you try to kick the field goal, you have probably a 99% chance or so of making it, and then overtime is essentially a coin flip (probably slightly less than a coin flip, given that they're on the road and the offense has struggled).  I'd peg the chance of taking it to overtime and winning at about 48% or so.
The question then becomes, do you think you have a play with a 48% chance or greater of getting the touchdown there?  At the 1/2 yard line, with one of the better backs in the NFL? I think you do.
Playcalling is a bit suspect (I agree with Gruden there on the QB sneak, saves enough time to potentially still kick the field goal). ",2,0,1444710422,1444727279

Bigger issues is that his defense looks pretty abysmal by the number, he never played in more than 135 games in a season, and only 4 times played in more than 100 games.  ",2,0,1444420028,1444727279
