But she clearly is a bit immature and has plenty to realize about the world. She did leave crying, so perhaps some reflection and growing up will occur throughout this. I'd be patient if I was op. No reason to throw away the friendship, just back off a bit and reiterate your stance as needed. ",17,0,1444320328,1444728996

I blame Sam Altman. He led the funding round that coincides with everything bad. Seems pretty clear there is investor pressure behind many of the missteps. That's Sam. ",6,0,1443856455,1444728996
