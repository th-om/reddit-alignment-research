You can have your liberal utopia and the those of us that don't want to live there can live in the conservative country. You can't come over here though when you run out of money.

cvwcog1,0,t1_cvw8za5,mcthreadski,"That's it exactly. If there wasn't so much to gain by currying favor with the government, corporations would lose interest pretty quickly. The irony is that most people on the left that want to put more power in the hands of government to combat the corporations don't seem to realize that by doings so, they actually make it more likely for corporatists to corrupt the system to gain a competitive advantage.
