You know a 'tomboy' is 'a girl who acts like a stereotypical boy', right?  It's right in the name.  

> a role reversal from the norm

Bullshit.  

I will agree that violence by girls against boys (or women against men) is not taken as seriously as the other way around, as the flip side of a society that sees violence and aggression as 'manly'.  But there's no stereotype saying that girls use violence and harassment to express interest in boys they like.  Rather, it's the other way around - and it's because the tomboy in those movies is 'one of the guys' that she expresses her emotions through 'playful' violence.

That being said, this girl *had to go to the hospital*.  The message here is that a boy *put a girl in the fucking hospital* because he likes her.  I hear the same thing applied to adult (female) victims of domestic violence - ""you couldn't make him that mad if he didn't love you""... this is abuser talk, and it's really telling - and really creepy - that a 4-year-old child is being told that ""men hurt people they love"".",12,0,1444712085,1444731810
cvxmzx9,0,t1_cvwawpx,aescolanus,">Can someone explain why feminists who aren't women of colour should avoid critiquing white feminism?

I agree with what /u/flapyourwings posted, but I think what the article said about 'co-opting' WOC's critiques is a more problematic issue.  White feminists have a huge advantage when it comes to getting their voices heard and disseminating their viewpoints (because of structural racism) so when white feminists talk about 'white feminism', it makes it harder for the non-white feminists - you know, the people who actually know, from personal experience, what they're talking about - to get a word in edgewise.

It gets even more shitty when, as the article says:

>White women us[e] “White Feminism” as a stick with which to beat each other, and not a prompt to consider their own racism[.]

I have no problem with white feminists pointing to non-white feminists and saying 'this is a real problem, read this'.  But white feminists talking for, and over, WOC, is a self-demonstrating example of the problem that needs to be solved.",3,0,1444699414,1444731810

cvra1zp,0,t1_cvr91zg,aescolanus,"> as I understand it, affirmative action is mainly defended by its proponents as a system to correct historic wrongs, which caused setbacks for certain groups within the population.

That's one reason.  AA is also used to correct existing wrongs, for instance, those caused by structural racism.  In the US, [a white man with a felony conviction has a higher chance of getting a job interview than a black man with a clean record and an identical resume](https://csgjusticecenter.org/reentry/posts/researchers-examine-effects-of-a-criminal-record-on-prospects-for-employment/).  It doesn't matter if this is because of historical factors or modern cultural factors - the bias exists, statistically, and affirmative action (all else being equal, hire the non-white person) is an effective way of counteracting that bias.  AA is also used to help bring services to underserviced communities - for example, there are quotas for black doctors, specifically because black doctors are more likely to work in black communities and more likely to be trusted by those communities.  (And black communities *need* more doctors, because [the gap between black and white life expectancies is insane](http://www.businessinsider.com/huge-black-white-gap-in-life-expectancy-in-us-2014-8).)  AA is also used for educational purposes, e.g., creating a more diverse student body so that universities don't turn into white dude/chick circlejerks.  And so forth.  Righting *historical* wrongs is important, but recognizing *existing* problems, and taking steps to solve them, is much more important.

> I am however opposed to simple quota. Mainly because they often actually HURT minorities: if quota are used, they are often viewed as the token woman/black guy/old guy at work, that only got hired for their minority status, rather than their skills. Quota simply are simply a horrible that treats the symptom, not the cause of the problem, as it strives for more equality in outcome rather than opportunity.

I would argue that there are practical uses for quotas, and, more, that the failure to live up to a quota is often a good sign that there's bias in the system (in a city that's 50% Hispanic, if only 10% of your workforce is Hispanic, there's something odd going on).  That being said, the 'quotas make minorities look like tokens' argument is bullshit, because bigoted white people will fucking *always* call people tokens, whether there's an affirmative action system in place or not.  If there's a quota, they'll say 'token'.  If there's no actual quota, they'll say 'token' anyway, and blame 'political correctness'.  If the person hired/promoted is a woman, they'll throw in accusations of sleeping their way to the top.  I mean, hell, affirmative action in its most common form says 'ONLY consider race if the qualifications for two candidates are otherwise EQUAL', and people still say affirmative action means hiring unqualified minorities.  They don't say it because of the quota system.  They say it because they think no non-white can ever do a job as well as a white man.

Which is also, as it happens, a contributing factor in white America's 'ignore it and it'll go away' attitude towards racial inequality.  If you read any discussion of racial inequality as an attack on you personally, of course you'll get defensive and hostile and shut down and believe that talking about race is useless.

Many people *in America* (and in other countries too, I'm sure, but I'm just referencing the current American political situation) reject any legal recognition of racial inequality (including affirmative action) because they believe that an officially color-blind government is the most effective way to eliminate prejudice and achieve racial equality.

The example of Sweden, though, demonstrates that an officially color-blind government does *not* help to achieve racial equality; it just covers up the problem.  It's like putting a band-aid on over a splinter - you might think it's solving the problem, and, for some problems, a band-aid *is* the right solution, but if you want to heal that splinter has to come out.

Also, though it's not really relevant to my point:  if you want 'legalized racial discrimination', look up Scandinavia's treatment of the Sami people.  Or the Jews.",5,0,1444222610,1444731810
