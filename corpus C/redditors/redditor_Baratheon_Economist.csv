>We should have had a large recovery, and didn't.

Sure, but my point is that other factors must be taken into account. Most of the reasoning I see goes ""Mainstream Econ says policy A does negative effect X, government follows A, gets X and everybody is blaming situation Z on that policy"". 

It's not *incorrect* to criticise the Conservative Party on austerity, but people tend to not to consider potential things like magnitude (which, in the case of British austerity relative to other economies, rather muddled) or other potential causes. 

>(do you mean why 1.5 specifically?)

Yes; although my problem more specifically is being linked to a blogpost in which Wren-Lewis explicitly claims he is not doing anything with particular empirical rigor with his post. 

The papers you quoted are also interested by the way. I could throw you a couple of papers on fiscal stimulus from the likes of Eggertson, Romer, etc, but I'll hold out.

See my link somewhere else where the OECD graph in question is present; looking explicitly at fiscal consolidation over the course of 2010-2014 shows the UK has had less austerity than the OECD average and much less than the US. 

>so it's pretty undeniable really.

I never said the link doesn't exist. I said the correlation between fiscal austerity and economic contraction are not particularly tight. ",2,0,1444485316,1444724710

The same is true of many countries who did not perform austerity, who did perform austerity and the same is *not* true for countries which--again--both did and did not perform austerity. Nobody's disputing that we've had a particularly anemic recovery. 

>that and NNDI are even worse. The latter still isn't above the pre-crisis level.

And? This is not *a priori* a result of austerity; most economists are away of stagnant real wages and pay due to depressed *productivity* which I mentioned in my original post. 

>but they pulled back in 2012 when they saw the effects  - a loss of up to 14% of GDP, considering we were/are at the ZLB.

I'm rather disappointed all you could give me is Wren-Lewis's blog, given the amount of sourced claims you made in your post. Wren-Lewis quite flagrantly says he is assuming a multiplier of 1.5 while not providing any evidence--and, as he notes, the OBR assumes a lower multiplier. He identifies this: ""I did a simple exercise""; he's *assuming* some kind of multiplier without significant evidence to prove a point about how austerity *could* be substantially harmful, and there are way too many other variables like monetary offset to make this a particularly rigorous piece.

Not really; you can maintain a constant level of spending and have the budget deficit fall due to rising tax receipts. If the budget deficit was a sufficient proxy for net spending and its alterations (and thus stimulus/austerity), we wouldn't have a need for ""fiscal consolidation"" as a separate measure in the first place.",4,0,1444441245,1444724710

[Not too sure about that](http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2015/04/08/did-austerity-work-in-britain-one-chart-tells-it-all/); austerity in the UK has been rather paltry. Interestingly, discounting Eurozone countries produces an even *looser* correlation; monetary policy, as has been the mainstream view for several decades, is much more important than fiscal policy.

Yes, but as I said, the correlation is not particularly tight. As the UK has demonstrated, it's possible to have relatively low austerity and growth. While the US has demonstrated it's possible to have pretty significant austerity and growth. There is something else behind fiscal policy primarily pulling the strings.
