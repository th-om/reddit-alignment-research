cvw5iz8,0,t1_cvvtql7,OnNom,"Why do you consider it to be a 'reasonable first step' to institute gun bans? You are telling the government to ignore the 2nd Amendment: 'shall not be infringed'. If the government can successfully ignore the 2nd Amendment, they can successfully ignore the 1st and 4th, too. You are advocating for the government to cease observing all constitutional rights.",2,0,1444594656,1444718422

cvsgmsg,1,t3_3ny7ic,OnNom,"Lets say I believe I have justifiably shot someone in self-defense (my state has a stand your ground law). When the police show up, they don't arrest me but do ask what happened. I answer, ""I believed my life was in danger and I defended myself. I will not be answering any further questions until after I talk to a lawyer.""

Does the fact that I answered one question, but refused to answer any followups mean I have waived my 5th Amendment rights for all of the following questions?

cvsfuq7,0,t1_cvrzm9k,OnNom,You say that like US police never kill people. They [murdered a seven year old girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Aiyana_Jones) in her own home which they didn't even have a warrant to enter. No officer was convicted of any crime. ,1,0,1444311032,1444718422
