But the laws were initially set up to control the beer industry and keep it from spawning big companies, if I remember correctly. I'm actually currently doing research for my thesis on craft breweries and self distribution! 

Smaller breweries can definitely make some gains with distributing through bigger players. They also have much to gain from self distribution. It's got to hit a sweet spot.",3,0,1444706478,1444730046

cvp7r3g,0,t1_cvp6mji,barne080,"Right, I understand that farmers save and harvest seeds the following year. Monsanto Canada Inc. vs. Scheimer is the case that most Monsanto opposition cite (not saying you are the opposition, just choosing the most illustrative case). The main point is that Schmeiser knew that the seeds he saved and harvested were not his but Monsanto's. Therefore, he violated Monsanto's patent protection. I think any company would do the exact same thing. ",3,0,1444072103,1444730046
