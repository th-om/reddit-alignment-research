Keep drinking that kool-aid.

Bet you even believe the 97% part too.

If you ask all the astrologers if astrology is true what will they say?

I really dont care what you believe until you and your like start wanting to spend trillions of dollars that will bankrupt countries and cause mass starvation in poorer countries.

But that is the goal isnt it.  Funny how all the man made global warming alarmist are also socialist.  Funny funny funny.

Yes we will disagree.  Especially since scientist are dropping out of this hoax daily.

I find you scary.  You are willing to let millions of people die because of a group of debunked quasi-scientist say so.     Lets take trillions of dollars on something that has not been proven by any scientific method at all.  Only thing you have is computer models.   That's it, and they have been shown to be incorrect and the very scientist who are telling you to be scared have been shown to have monkeyed with the numbers.

>the evidence accumulated through the interpretation of massive amounts of blatant data, 

Does not exist and you have read none of it.  You are taking it on faith that the same people in the news and in politics who lie about everything else are telling you the truth this one an only time.

Lets see.

-More ice than has ever been recorded.

-No warming in 20 years now.

-97 percent myth blown out of the water.

-Scientist caught lying about the numbers to hide that no warming has been happening.

-Global cooling, Global warming, no no no.  Man made global climate change, a convenient  term that really has no meaning at all.


So I will ask you straight up.  Do you think the world should spend trillions of dollars on this right now, even though we know it will cause poor nations to starve and millions to die.   Should we?

I guess we are going to have to agree to disagree.  I want those millions of people to live.



I will give you the last word as it is a waste of time presenting you with data, especially since have such great sources like Al Gore and MSNBC.

Have nice night(This is not sarcasm, i mean it. Have a nice night)

If you think a company making a profit is bad you are stupid.

You also talk about donations.  None of this is donations from the fans. It is donations from the NFL.   The fans are not donating, the NFL is taking part of their profits and donating it.  You are not even adding in the cancer awareness this brings.   You can not even find out how many people learned about this while watching the NFL and actually donated their own money.

The NFL has done nothing wrong and they have not lied about it to anyone.

Stop being stupid and thank them for the millions they have donated from their profits.
