cvvqveb,1,t3_3oaqoo,HoustonTexan,"Whatever quarterback is graded as first round worthy talent in this year's draft. While Savage looked like he improved drastically in the preseason, we just can't bank another season on someone like him with big question marks and not too much upside. If we drafted someone who needs to learn a bit, I would be okay with them sitting the first few games. In the end though, this team has to draft a QB. I think for the first time in a long time you would see people supporting the Texans far less because this fan base is foaming at the mouth for a QB.",2,0,1444567235,1444727413

cvshdt7,1,t3_3nyrqr,HoustonTexan,"I've finished the Spanish/German/French trees. I really enjoyed all of the courses. I'm basically just trying to learn enough to be able to get by. I do not want to be conversational, I just do not want to run into a situation where, let's say, I'm in France and I need to get somewhere and I'm unlucky because nobody speaks English and I need to get to the Louvre. I can get there now because of Duolingo which is exactly what I wanted! The only one I want to be conversational is Spanish. My job is kind of hectic right now, but when things get settled I plan on going to a Spanish learners speaking practice group.

Edit: I should add that I plan on doing Russian when it is released.",6,0,1444313800,1444727413
