cvvyjyi,0,t1_cvvwcds,SirPunchy,"... Crusher? Have you ever played conquest? Or is your plan to walk right past the minion wave that will undoubtedly already be cleared by Sol and dive the tower with autos? 

> she's the first Mage to actually be a functioning ADC

Well, you've obviously never been in Duo lane. Freya is a top 3 ADC. She's still a hyper carry who runs away with the game if played well. 

Finally, if you don't think there's something wrong with her 3 then there's nothing I can say to help you. It's a ludicrously over-bloated ability and I can't believe it made it all the way to the live client. ",1,0,1444584031,1444730704
cvv2pwd,0,t1_cvv27qy,SirPunchy,"A stun that comes with a damage buff isn't a factor early? It's what makes her so dangerous to aggress on in mid lane, where she is an increasingly common pick. And why wouldn't you be linked with someone if you're rotating out of mid, where the jungler spends a huge amount of time in this meta. And the mid and Jungle share as many camps as they can. Regardless of what level kiss is at, it's still stats the other team doesn't have and it only gets better as the game goes on. 

I don't understand how you can try to trivialize Aphro's place in a meta that obviously favors her. High ranked and pro players swear by her, she's done work in the SPL, and we are still here discussing her effectiveness for some reason.",1,0,1444507404,1444730704
cvv26zo,0,t1_cvv1req,SirPunchy,If you're not comparing them as supports the your points are moot. They're entirely different character who are purposed for different things. They are both strong and contribute well to a team. Saying Khepri makes Aprho less valuable is absolutely wrong if you're saying that about her solo or mid lane presence. ,1,0,1444506424,1444730704
cvv1wx5,0,t1_cvv1i4n,SirPunchy,"I'm happy you brought that up again, because I think it's hilarious that you don't realize how wrong that is. A frequent damage buff means you and the linked God have an advantage in a fight where no one has a clear lead, a massive advantage from a lead, and a way to minimize a strength difference if you're behind. The constant movement speed means you can rotate easier and have a generally better map presence than the other team. Not to mention being able to chase and retreat easier with the constant buff. And *all of that* doesn't consider the constant sustain from the MP5 and healing when linked. These things are all available more than Khepri's ult by a huge margin, and relevant at all points in the game.

I don't even like Aphrodite, but you're so wrong it caused me physical discomfort. ",1,0,1444505907,1444730704
cvv1nbg,1,t3_3o8zhq,SirPunchy,"Lol.. Are you really comparing a guardian, who is 100% designed to support, to a Mage in the support role? They aren't really comparable at all. Aphro has been a cheeky and ineffective support for as long as I've been playing. Saying that Khepri made her obsolete as a support is just wrong. Guardians, as a whole made her an obsolete support. And she's far from obsolete in other lanes. She's still a viable solo later, and an excellent mid laner. ",2,0,1444505416,1444730704
cvuwazj,0,t1_cvuqmi5,SirPunchy,"> I don't understand why he's at fault to begin with 

Hahaha, what?! An employee of hi Rez and a face of our community went in a profanity laced, slanderous rant about a random player for no reason. Personal attacks are not the same thing as bad mouthing players you don't like. If you don't understand that, there's nothing we can do to help you, kid. 

DM is a sickness, draining smite's credibility and poisoning the player base with his toxicity. Him and his supporters both should be ashamed by how often these outbursts are in the spotlight of the community. They are not the actions of a mature adult.",3,0,1444495646,1444730704

But seriously, if he wants to be considered a serious contender he should actually put together a better striking/submission game and finish a damn fight. Unimpressive people don't fight for belts.",-3,0,1443944104,1444730704
