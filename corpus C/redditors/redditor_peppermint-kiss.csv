cvx9tea,0,t1_cvwk8d6,peppermint-kiss,"Clothing requires some forethought, but it hasn't been a problem for me.  It's easy to highlight (bodycon, belts) or hide (baggy, layers) corsets as you please.

My style has adjusted so much that it's hard to say what's from corsetry or not!  I actually stopped wearing my corset a few months back as I moved internationally and have been unpacking my life and everything so my style right now is mostly leggings and T-shirts lol.

When I did wear it, I tried to wear it daily, at least five days a week, but I was never super strict about it.  I don't know what a ""corset moment"" is lol.  And I never go out in hot weather anyway lol (straight to the a/c) but I've heard mesh corsets are great for breathability.

Hope these answers help!! :)",1,0,1444679204,1444719014

cvx4eog,0,t1_cvwxo01,peppermint-kiss,"That's an excellent point...as a teenager whose basic needs are all met but who is told what to do by our parents, personal freedom becomes issue number one.  As an adult who has maybe more freedom than we want (What job? What house? What life partner?) but has to work hard to survive, issues like a social safety net and a sense of fairness become paramount.

The issue arises when people blame their boss for being a hardass, for example, when the real reason they're stressed out is that they have a shitty job that can't provide a decent wage.  They feel trapped and oppressed, but lay the blame on close interpersonal levels - or even ingroup/outgroup association - rather than seeing the larger picture of societal and economic imbalances.",6,0,1444671427,1444719014
