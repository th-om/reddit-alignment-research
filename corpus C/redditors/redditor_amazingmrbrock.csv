The conservatives have a long history of tax cuts for the wealthy and trimming various government services to make up the difference. Which along with various conservative social values contributes to the conservative philosophy. 

The parties make up a spectrum from the conservative values of the CPC (conservative party of canada) to the philosophically liberal values of the green party. The greens essentially want more environmental regulations, and increased socialization of the government which would be things like better medical, dental, etc. They intend to pay for these things by increasing taxes on the companies and the wealthy.

This time around the liberal party are kind of in the middle, with the NDP being more philosophically liberal than the liberal party but still being close to the middle, and then the aforementioned green party.

There used to be multiple conservative parties but they merged a few elections back. Which has resulted in a statistical minority of the voting population (~33%) the ability to elect majority government. A majority being a parliament where the winning party can pass whatever they want and the other parties together are unable to stop it.",-3,0,1444602926,1444728860
