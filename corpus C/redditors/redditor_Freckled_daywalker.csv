cvmjzwc,0,t1_cvmjae0,Freckled_daywalker,"Yup. That's it exactly. I don't have the exact studies to link here, I apologize but anything that looks at cost comparison for UK vs Canada is a starting point. There are also a few that look at Tricare (military health insurance) costs for network care (private) vs direct care (government owned) but just be aware they don't always do a good job of factoring in the benefit of using active duty staffing for physicians and nurses. 

Edit: NM, I see what you were asking about when you mentioned cost analysis. I don't have that but one thing to consider is that currently, the private sector commits a significant amount of resources to the billing, reimbursement and collections tasks necessitated by having multiple insurers. Those administrative costs are currently a big part of what is killing the small private practice model, especially in low paying specialists like family practice. Also, with a single payer, the concept of ""networks"" and ""preferred providers"" goes away. Additionally, guy could have a tiered system like Tricare where the base model (Tricare Standard, which is lile a PPO, has higher copays but still a reasonable yearly out of pocket cap) and charge more for the higher end model (Tricare Prime, which has low or no copays, depending on where you go). Tricare Prime is somewhere around $500/yr for family coverage. ",1,0,1443854770,1444720309
cvmj949,0,t1_cvmipk7,Freckled_daywalker,">""Viability"" has nothing to do with personhood. There are people who cannot live without a dialysis machine and other forms of life support - they're still people.

Sure they are but they also don't have a recognized right to be provided that life support no matter what the cost. A person whose life is dependent on an organ transplant doesn't have the right to take it from another person. Yes, we have laws like EMTALA that provide some protections but there's no ""right to life at all costs"". We deny life saving treatments and surgery to patients who can't afford them all the time. 

>There's a difference between passively letting the fetus die as a result of labor induction (a non destructive procedure which is never used) and a D&E where you actively try to kill the fetus by dismembering it. 

So are you equally opposed to the 91% of abortions that occur in the first trimester (since D&E is only used for second trimester pregnancies)? Have you considered the reason we don't perform 2nd trimester abortions via labor induction because it's longer, more painful and riskier than a D&E and the end result would be exactly the same, fetal demise? (Though I'll grant you, there are edge cases at the 23+ week mark). Why add unnecessary risk? If the difference for you is simply passive vs active, then I'd (respectfully) argue that your position is founded in emotion, not logic. 

>And you can still abort a healthy, viable fetus in the US. We have abortions in my state until 28 weeks.

Third trimester abortions are exceedingly rare, and something not even all prochoice people can agree upon. There are situations where I'd argue it's appropriate (gross fetal abnormalities mostly).

cvmfuz4,0,t1_cvmdpu6,Freckled_daywalker,"So then is it reasonable to say that addressing the laws that apply to gun control is a part of the solution? I'm not trying to be snarky, just trying to point out that it's not an all or nothing thing. I completely agree with you that access to mental health care is a huge component that needs to be addressed but there is also potential for sensible gun laws to be effective in reducing these terrible events. Did you know that failures in the background check system also allowed the Charleston Church shooter and the Lafayette Theater shooter to lawfully purchase guns? The first had a record of using illegal substances and the latter was involuntarily committed. Both would have been barred from purchasing weapons, had the system worked the way it's intended to.

cvm7c0q,0,t1_cvm6zuv,Freckled_daywalker,"Maybe slightly fewer but not enough to make PP unnecessary in most places. People who had Medicaid prior to the ACA still have Medicaid and states that took the expansion will have increased Medicaid populations (Usually without increasing their network capacity). States that didn't take the expansion likely have high populations of people in the coverage gap (so they're still uninsured). Additionally, some people who used PP when they didn't have coverage like their provider at PP and want to continue to use them even after they get private coverage. ",1,0,1443824959,1444720309
