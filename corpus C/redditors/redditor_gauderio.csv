They are not happier because they're richer, they're happier because the character (Martin's dad) learned to stand for himself. The fact that they're richer is just a byproduct of that and also a way to quickly show that on the movie.",3,0,1444071306,1444719415
cvnwshg,0,t1_cvnuke4,gauderio,"Well, I hate a lot of the stuff that the democrats do but I just can't vote republican because of their attacks on Planned Parenthood, their position on health care and their overall anti-science behavior. I think that education, health care, military, police should be handled by the government. I think that we need lots of regulation to keep the companies in check - I don't believe they would self regulate, there are many examples where this doesn't happen. I'm also in favor of gun control. I really don't want another conservative judge in the supreme court because of these issues. I think that the Benghazi issue is actually bad for the republicans because they just can't let it go. Embassies are attacked all the time. Can you imagine if 9/11 happened under a democrat president? We would still be investigating it.

I hate that I will have to vote on Hillary. This is because of the ""first past the post"" system we have here. But because of the issues above I cannot see myself voting for a republican ever.

I hate that the democrats are in bed with many powerful groups as well. I think that all government programs should be audited all the time to make them more efficient and less corrupt. I think that teachers should be evaluated. I think that we should have a strong military.

By the way, I used to watch Bill Maher, John Stewart, but I also liked to watch Bill O'Reily and Fox News. I even listened to Michael Savage before, during and after 9/11. My best friend is a republican (I know, this sounds like ""I also have a black friend"").

Edit: also, the religion thing.",2,0,1443977504,1444719415
