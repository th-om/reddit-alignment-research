Having a forprofit healthcare system doesn't suddenly increase the number of people interested in becoming doctors. In fact, we have a major nurse shortage in the US right now. I'm seriously considering moving to a different country but I wouldn't even know where to begin that process ",2,0,1444666992,1444731786

Is this person new to the party? This isn't new for Dawkins. He's openly criticized Islam possibly more than anyone I've ever seen. And they're both right. The Islamic world has some of the worst human rights abuses on the planet. Normally I don't give a shit what you do or what you wear but when you have countries like Saudi Arabia where women have died in house fires because they weren't allowed to leave before covering themselves you can get fucked.

They're criticizing a belief which is something regularly done in the western world with western ideals and religions. I don't know why people pretend like Islam gets a pass. If your beliefs lead to mass assholery then it needs to be criticized. ",3,0,1444650458,1444731786
cvwte70,0,t1_cvwpdzp,maowsers93,Oh believe me we wait for our appointments too. I can get an appointment with my general practitioner within a few days but if it is a specialist like a neurologist or a psychologist your ass is waiting weeks to months. The price doesn't reduce the wait times. ,1,0,1444649950,1444731786
