Your month old post made it to the front page.

I'll skip over the part where you want an end to child sacrifice, yet are willing to see your children killed if you are wrong.

I'm interested in the shape of the edges of this flat earth, and also how thick you think it is.

Also, what is on the bottom side of this slab?",5,0,1444518573,1444728826

From that we can get a better understanding of the *fatality* numbers.

I have no idea at all what to make of pedestrian, bus, train, and bicycle deaths.

Data *can* be beautiful, but not this time.",1,0,1443743447,1444728826

>*Pretty much the description of street skating right there. I hope they never stop.*

I have no doubt that defines the culture. I didn't think for a minute I had stumbled upon that many 'exceptions' to the ""masses of 'good' street skaters"".

Your hope will be granted. Many of today's street skaters will mature, find non-destructive hobbies, and become responsible members of society.

A few will forever embrace the culture.

But there will *always* be a fresh crop of destructive, disruptive individuals - with and without skateboards - to continue the culture you wish for.",1,0,1443643361,1444728826
cvio8es,1,t3_3muu71,Torquing,"Over the course of the past two decades I have seen groups of skateboarders on college and high school campuses, sidewalks, streets, shopping malls, etc.. Hundreds of skaters in total.

Through all those viewings in all those venues, I have never once seen a group (3 or more) of skateboarders that was *not* being destructive, disruptive, or both.

Not one time.

I know others feel differently, but this has been my personal experience.",1,0,1443568072,1444728826

cvdveg3,0,t1_cvckhda,Torquing,"I admit, you fished me in. I took the bait. I read your linked article.

/u/BustnIt got my attention by calling you out for this idiotic statement:

>*""There's no big bad sexist men taking advantage of poor girls being forced to do porn to survive. These women love their work and make piles of money.""*

You promised to smack him/her down with ""multiple primary sources"", and then posted a single link to an article about statistics - *many unverified* - posted to the IAFD database.

The unverified aspect of the information is irrelevant, because the article is irrelevant to your claims.

The article mentions *no details* about porn star earnings, let alone ""piles of money"". *No details* about porn star happiness with their profession, let alone ""love their work"". *No details* about exploitation.

In other words, your supporting ""primary source"" is not only derivative, but based solely upon partially subjective data from questionable sources.

But worse, contains not one shred of evidence. No phrase or sentence, relating *in any way* to the foolish claims you were called out for.

Shame on me for taking the bait from such a simple-minded troll as you. Disgrace on me if I ever give you a second chance.",1,0,1443197659,1444728826
