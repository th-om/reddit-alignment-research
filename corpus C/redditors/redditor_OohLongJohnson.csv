So weed is legal to posses, grow and distribute as a ""gift"", but the city cannot set up recreational dispensaries or make any money off of the multimillion dollar market.

cvmhrxb,0,t1_cvm4zmn,OohLongJohnson,"DC resident here - quick clarification. Congress does not actually control DC, they don't legislate for the city - it's just that they approve the budget for the city which gives them some degree of ""veto power"", if that makes sense. 

In fact Congress isn't technically even in DC. It's on Federal land. Possession is still illegal in DC in all federally controlled parts (including our extensive park system and the mall downtown). 

They can cut funding to things but can't actually write laws for DC. That's why it was funny seeing conservative representatives trying to block decriminalization in DC, how do you defund decriminalization? 

Legalization is a different story though because there needs to be some amount of federal funds to establish that. That's why the legalization in DC is so fucked up. Possession is legal, and growing, but you still can't sell or buy it - people can even give it to each other as long as they don't charge. So now there are guys who sell tshirts that just happen to come with a *free* eighth. It also means that the city can't make tax money off of the huge legal market that it's residents voted (over 70%) to establish.

Also DC gets no voting representation in congress... It's an absolute mess, and has basically turned into a way for far right congressmen to be dicks to a very liberal city. 

Sorry for the long post, but please keep reading. This man is a disgusting person and I want you to know of him.

One particular dick head is [Andy Harris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Harris_(politician). Dr. Harris was an anesthesiologist before he became a Politician in MDs most conservative district. During his career, he became very close to the pharmaceutical industry, so it's no surprise he had a pharma company in MD bankroll his campaign. Andy led the charge against DC legalization not for ethical reasons - Andy is a Dr, he knows the truth about MJ. You see he did it because he makes money off of keeping weed illegal. 

>Shortly after his success in blocking the District voters' will, several media outlets revealed a serious conflict of interest involved in his stance on marijuana reform. It came to light that Harris' third largest campaign donor is the pharmaceutical corporation Emergent BioSolutions, based in Rockville, Maryland. One of Emergent's products is epsil, ""a fast-acting treatment that reduces the pain associated with oral mucositis,"" which is a common complication of chemotherapy from cancer treatment. Marijuana has been recognized formally in a number of states as having immense therapeutic potential for cancer patients. In fact, in states where medical marijuana has legalized, the number of pharmaceutical pain killers prescribed has dropped significantly. The congressman has not explicitly addressed this issue, but it is now clear Harris has not disclosed an important conflict of interest surrounding his recent activity against marijuana reform.[35]

Now think about that. He's a doctor, but is trying to keep something that he knows can help cancer patients illegal, so that he can make money off of selling them a synthetic substitute. 

These are the people fighting for prohibition. People who don't care about any of us or what the public wants, they just want to do what is best for them.

Harris is hated in DC. The Mayor called for a boycott of all tourism to his district (it's on the eastern shore) and his face was put up on the Internet and throughout restaurants and stores saying not to serve him. 

If you ever run into him make sure to kick him in the nuts or something.",1,0,1443847570,1444729541
cvmak85,0,t1_cvm94hd,OohLongJohnson,"I agree, I'm not trying to compare gun suicides with gun homocides in terms of preventability. What I am getting at is that gun suicides are the *least preventable* types of suicides as things currently are. They require very little planning, are very easy to pull off, and unfortunately extremely effective. 

I posted this link below too, but gun suicide attempts are lethal 85% of the time, while suicide attempts in general are successful just 8.5% of the time. That's a staggering difference! Poisoning/overdose attempts for comparison are the most popular type of suicide attempt, yet only are fatal 2.2% of the time. Gun suicides make up over half of fatal suicides but only 6% of total attempts. 

There is also a strong correlation between gun ownership and suicide rates (also posted in another comment). I think this is what the author was getting at - less access to guns would absolutely mean less fatal suicides. Also among those who fail suicide attempts, gun users are most often left terribly debilitated, while those who attempt other methods can fully recover. 

Our country has a tremendous problem with suicide, and it is only growing. Gun homocide is of course a horrible problem as well. However, twice as many people each year fatally shoot themselves than those who fatally shoot others. Yes people will always be driven to suicide, but if they are going to attempt it I would prefer that they fail and hopefully find help, reconsider and be able to live a full life afterwards.

cvlx9x7,0,t1_cvlwrp2,OohLongJohnson,"Again you are largely misreading. My point is not really that ""guns increase suicide"" - what is more important is that guns increase *success* of suicides. 

Citation - http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/

In terms of suicide rates, many factors go into the differences between countries. Most of them are cultural. The U.S. is not the world leader in the developed world, but it's also not too far behind.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/suiciderate.html

Now studying whether guns actually increase suicide rates is quite difficult. What has been found is that gun owners are at significantly higher risk for suicide, and that states with higher gun ownership have higher rates of suicide. So strong correlative research points to gun ownership increasing suicide rates.

Edit - after reviewing those citations evidence is actually far stronger than I thought that gun ownership increases suicide risk, even when controlling for poverty, demographics and mental health.",0,0,1443808819,1444729541
