cv3v5h8,0,t1_cv3p04m,umbra_swords,"Exactly.   The broad definition of political ad, with such an unknown future to it, made it a done deal.  Its shocking to see uneducated and misinformed people proclaim that the Citizen's United decision was anything but a good outcome.  

Reddit, which is a corporation, would have been punished for the SOPA blackout under Citizen's United as its a corporation providing political endorsement.   A journalist writing for a paper could be silenced for an opinion piece before an election, or a blogger, or even a twitter post by an employee at a media outlet.

The time between those two decisions, along with a history of case law, is why that is common.  

In Plessy v Ferguson, separate but equal makes sense.  Brown v Board shows that while the theory exists, in practice it fails and thus the decision was overturned.

>United States v. Ross (1982) effectively negated Robbins v. California (1981).

The court's plurality opinion also considered the case of Robbins v. California (453 U.S. 420), a case decided in 1981 which bore more similarity to the Ross case. In that case, police pulled over a car smelling marijuana smoke, and proceeded to search the car. In the trunk they found two packages wrapped in opaque plastic, which they unwrapped, discovering marijuana inside. The Supreme Court ruled that the warrantless search of the vehicle was legal, but the warrantless search of the two packages found within was unconstitutional. The court in the Ross case rejected the Robbins finding. Justice Stevens suggests that the parties in the Robbins case had not presented the appropriate arguments that would allow the court to fully consider the issue. Stevens goes on to declare that the Ross case allows for the ""thorough consideration of the basic principles in this troubled area."" Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr., who had sided with the plurality in the Robbins case which declared that search unconstitutional, sided with the plurality in the Ross case which declared the search constitutional, effectively negating the Robbins decision. Justice Potter Stewart, who had written the plurality opinion on the Robbins case, had retired and was replaced by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who sided with the plurality on the Ross case.

>And since Citizens United's principle holding was decided on ideological lines, it's not unreasonable to think there is a decent chance that the Court could overturn it if the ideological composition of the Court changed.

Totally agree, but I would think that because the dissenting parties in Citizen's United did not use strong legal reasoning, but rather fear and emotion to justify their positions, it will be harder in the future to overturn.   Steven's dissent rested near solely on the fear of corruption in politics, while acknowledging that corporations are uniquely punished compared to other groups.  ",2,0,1442432944,1444727892

That would be like saying that the court should have ruled against gay marriage because it overturned decades of marriage law.  That isn't a valid criticism and isn't what the justices dissented on.

What I specifically wrote was that SCOTUS works hard to keep a logical and consistent set of laws to operate within. Radically shifting positions, especially since the basis of the reason for the previous ruling has not changed, is not common.  

Their rulings are consistent, meaning that they won't rule for gay marriage recently and a few years later rule against it unless the legal basis has shifted completely.   ",5,0,1442419905,1444727892

The criticism that dissenting judges had wasn't related to what I wrote, so I believe that you accidentally deleted some part of your comment.
