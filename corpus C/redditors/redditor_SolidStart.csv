cvxpnp9,0,t1_cvxoguk,SolidStart,"Fair enough. It's a classic chicken and egg situation. Nobody is ready to take over for Cena because they never book anybody to beat Cena.  A good company can make ANYBODY the ""guy"" with solid booking. Ziggler might not be the guy, but it's not because he couldn't be. He is only 35.  If DDP can win his first world title at 43, anybody can be booked for anything",1,0,1444703517,1444722991
cvxo7z8,0,t1_cvxnune,SolidStart,"Most definitely a matter of taste, but the issue is that of your original question. If they fade him out, who takes over?  If they keep feeding guys to him that throw the kitchen sink but never win, nobody CAN take over. Cena did a great job elevating the title, but if you have him lose to a babyface, THAT person could keep the US Open Challenge going and elevate themselves.  That can't happen if Cena is made to be unbeatable.

cvxnt00,0,t1_cvxnh9u,SolidStart,Seriously. I would buy another 10 subscriptions to the network if Cena would have hit the springboard stunner and Ziggler would have sold it like the Rock used to,1,0,1444700630,1444722991
cvxnpd0,0,t1_cvxnf45,SolidStart,"I don't disagree with the idea, but Ziggler was getting the cheers in that match. Put him over and you have a title change in Raw and a face who can carry a continuing US Open challenge. Even if you book Zig to lose, don't have him hit EVERYTHING while Cena hits 2 AAs and a few very restful STFs. If somebody elevates their game against Cena, Cena should have to elevate his too or else he looks boring and unbeatable. I don't need a bunch of new moves, but winning on something that's not an AA ""outta nowhere"" would make them both look sooooooo much better.",1,0,1444700473,1444722991
cvxnfsg,1,t3_3oin0k,SolidStart,"I think Wreddit is just mad that Cena dropped the springboard stunner. It's ok guys, he'll just keep using the AA!",-1,0,1444700071,1444722991
