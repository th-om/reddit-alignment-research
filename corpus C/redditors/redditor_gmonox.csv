>Wasserman Schultz said Thursday the “beauty of our party” is that it embraces divergent opinions, but that her decision on debates would stand.

>“This was a decision that I reached that, absolutely, I consulted and communicated with many people, including our officers, and decided that this was the best way to approach it,” she said.

IMO, both parties are composed of authoritarians to some degree, they just want to control different aspects of your life.",1,0,1444425228,1444730434

It's a personal concept for the most part, but if a person thinks that being gay is immoral, his neighbor getting gay married doesn't affect him at all. Gay marriage being legal does not mean YOU have to get married to the same sex. You might have to have a slightly uncomfortable conversation with your children... oh, the humanity!

Same thing with sex changes. I don't understand why somebody would want to change their sex. It doesn't make sense to me. However, if somebody DOES want to do it, why the fuck should the government insert themselves between the person and their doctor? It's their choice, and it's fundamentally a medical decision that does not affect anyone beyond the person getting the change and their family/friends.",1,0,1444423043,1444730434

You can keep putting words in his mouth if you want, or you can wish that Politifact had fact checked in a different way, but the actual fact that they were checking was ""Chevrolet in Tokyo, Japan, 'doesn't exist'"". In 2013, 5.3 million cars were sold in Japan. Of those, less than 1200 were Chevys. So about 0.02% of cars sold in Japan in 2013 were Chevys. Statistically, that's pretty close to saying it doesn't exist. It should be mostly true.",1,0,1444405965,1444730434

If you're not likely to see one during a trip there, I'd say that makes his statement mostly true. They're taking his statement literally, when it's clearly not meant to be. Do you honestly believe Trump thinks that there isn't one single Chevy in Japan? ",0,0,1444350382,1444730434

Trump's quote:
>""When did we beat Japan at anything?"" Trump said in announcing his candidacy June 16, 2015. ""They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time.""


They rated it Mostly False

>In 2014, Chevrolet sold 597 cars in Japan. No, we are not forgetting any zeroes at the end of that figure.

[...]
>**Our ruling**

>Trump said Chevrolet cars in Tokyo don’t exist.

>Literally, that’s not true. Chevy sells cars in Japan.

>However, Chevy sales are more like a trickle compared to the flood of Japanese brands in the market. A journalist who covers the auto industry in Japan told us visitors would not likely see a Chevy during their stay in Japan.
