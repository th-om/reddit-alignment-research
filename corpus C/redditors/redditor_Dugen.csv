cvxu6z3,0,t1_cvxpxf4,Dugen,"> The Dems, on the other hand, are proposing more taxes on the rich and less on the poor, in order to tackle the huge wage inequality that riddles the economy. Various empirically-backed academic papers support the view that this will be better for the economy both in the short and long run.

More taxes on high income earners maybe, but part of the problem is that people keep calling that taxing the rich, when it isn't.  Rich means having money, not earning money. In taxing these ""rich"" we're pulling all the money and vitality from the economy, then wondering why the job market won't get better.  It's like having a pool that's leaking and running dry so you turn the hose on, but attach it to a pump and put it in the same pool.  It looks like you did something, and people feel a bit wetter, but it can't fix the problem.   If you want to *really* fix things, you have to plug the holes, and that means stopping the real rich from capturing so much of the money that flows through the economy with what they own.  If you can't do that, you just end up making the people at the bottom slightly more comfortable as the economy spirals into disaster. 

> You may say that any of the two policies is still too right-wing, Wall Street coddling, but you are discounting the need to be reasonable and have a sense of realpolitik when trying to pass laws through the two houses.

You call pro-wall street policies ""right wing"", but it's Democrats that repealed glass-steagall in exchange for huge bribes.    The Democrats like to give lip-service to the working class and pretend they're on their side, but when it comes to voting, they'll screw over the working population to benefit investors even faster than the Republicans.  Hollywood, and Wall St give more money to Democrats than they do to Republicans, and they're getting laws that screw the rest of us over in exchange.  

There's nothing right or left wing about fixing the economy.  We have a pro-rich Democratic party, and a pro-rich Republican party and there is no political party representing the interests of the other 99% of us.  As long as a party supports and promotes politicians based on how much money they bring in in donations, that party can't represent its voters, and everyone who participates in that party is being made a sucker.  The only way to fix this, is to change the structure of our existing parties, or abandon them for new ones. ",1,0,1444711736,1444722971

> Well...A lot of professors base grades on a bell curve, so that's up for debate.

No.  It's not.  The point of that statement was that if you don't think about things from the perspective of the dynamics of the whole system and only consider the dynamics of the individual, it can lead you to incorrect conclusions.  It's impossible for everyone to be above average, just like in a system with debt-backed currency it's impossible for everyone to be rich.  This is why an understanding of macroeconomics is so important when thinking about economic policies, and why it's so frustrating that so few people have that understanding.  Instead of an informed debate about what policies create the most fair and beneficial economic dynamics, we get crude discussions about irrelevant issues like ""too much regulation.""",2,0,1444398842,1444722971

cvt3vem,0,t1_cvt0nm4,Dugen,">  money saved and invested IS flowing through the economy.

On net, no, it isn't.  The money only stays in the economy if the investor loses it.  If they don't, as much money is taken out as is put in so it's a wash.  If they get returns, then more is removed than is added, and unless it is domestically re-invested, this represents economic harm.  You're also ignoring investments which represent money loaned back to the economy (CD's, treasury bonds, mortgage backed securities, etc).  These represent money that is not just locked away from us being able to earn it, but also used to extract money from us.

> The worst job someone can have is being paid to dig ditches and fill them back up.

No.  That job is net-neutral to the money flowing through the economy.  The worst job someone can have is to make lots of money they don't spend.  This is how economies are destroyed. 

>  Then you and I agree, recessions happen when a lot of wealth is destroyed.
