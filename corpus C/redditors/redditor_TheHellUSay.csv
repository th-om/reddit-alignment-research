cvvught,0,t1_cvvrshy,TheHellUSay,Yeah TPAB gets credit for the song but its not a one song album so using ONE song to justify calling it a classic is absurd.,2,0,1444576463,1444720815
cvvqq4k,0,t1_cvvmdog,TheHellUSay,Well no they wouldn't chant this is it was on Sremmlife but that's because of who the artist is. If Kendrick released Sremmlife + Alright yes it would be chanted anyway. I don't know how anyone can argue a single song stands for a whole album.,2,0,1444566716,1444720815

cvvj8wj,0,t1_cvuz835,TheHellUSay,"Good post. Just want to mention job opportunities haven't gotten any better in the last 25 years and they've actually have gotten worse since the 70s when comparing their unemployment rate to the white unemployment rate.

Its still easier for a white felon to get a call back than a black person with no record.",1,0,1444538744,1444720815
cvvj6yb,0,t1_cvvc4oh,TheHellUSay,"The descrimination of Jews in Germany lasted less than a generation it started in the mid to late 30s and was done by 45-46ish (sorry on my phone so not going to look it up right now). When the Nazi reign ended they still were educated, albeit slightly damaged, and ready to contribute to society as a group since they were a part of society for so long.

Black Americans were enslaved and literally treated as animals and property until 1865. In that period freed slaves were being sold back into slavery and educated black people in many places were killed. After that for the next hundred years black Americans were constantly terrorized, not allowed to try to join society, and not allowed to thrive on their own (the KKK comes to mind).

For example in the 1920s the richest black area in the country was Black Wall Street. It was an area ran by black businesses (since it was hard to get a job at a white business) with black customers (since many white businesses would not let you in or charged more). It was burned down by poor white people and the local police were actually permitted to use vehicles from WWI to bomb the city to pieces leaving 10,000-16,000 black Americans homeless without anywhere to go. There was an estimated $30 million dollars (in modern money) of damage done. What was the biggest example of black Americans actually dragging themselves out of the mud was gone.

Then we get to the great depression which left black Americans with over a 50% unemployment rate and started the massive movement of black people into major cities. It also birthed some memorable slogans in the south such as, ""No Jobs for Niggers Until Every White Man Has a Job"".

So then WWII comes and takes us out of the depression with war industry booming but again almost all of that wealth went to white Americans despite black Americans having an equal enrollment rate. The GI Bill was major at that time for allowing returning vets to build a good foundation for the future but out of 67,000 mortgages insured by the bill under 100 was taken by non whites.

Then we get into the Civil Rights era where things were more racially charged in this country then ever before but there was finally major steps made forward. Now everything was supposed to be equal but in reality it wasn't. From the 70s until just recently redlining and gentrification was very real, schools have become more segregated due to people acting like redlining isn't real and basically forcing black people to live in the slums (if you look at the numbers more middle class black people live in low income areas than any other race), and the wage gap has grown due to the fact that black people are in lower demand for jobs. Numbers show even now in 2015 a white felon has an even easier time getting a job than a black person with no criminal record.

And speaking of felons the war on drugs has devastated many inner city communities and set many up to basically be lifelong prisoners for profit. Now many people would say they're criminals and they deserve it but with no opportunities present people will create opportunities. There's also the fact that the CIA helped drugs get into the country and into those communities to fund the Contras and make a lot of money off the jails while at it.


TL;DR: Jews in Germany were oppressed for 10 years 80 years ago. Black people in the US were oppressed for 200+ years 50 years ago and are still being oppressed right now.",1,0,1444538623,1444720815
cvvbuo1,0,t1_cvvbkmj,TheHellUSay,They're chanting because of the message of that one song. Has nothing to do with the whole album. I know plenty of people who know Alright and have never heard the album or can't tell you the names of any of the other songs on the album (and I would say that's most people I know). So yes Kendrick has a possible classic song but to call the whole album classic because of a singular song is crazy.,5,0,1444524463,1444720815
cvvavtb,0,t1_cvv8k7m,TheHellUSay,Chanting the chorus to one song (that Kendrick didn't even write or perform fwiw) doesn't make an album classic.,7,0,1444522620,1444720815
