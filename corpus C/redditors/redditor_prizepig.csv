I think people have forgotten how passionate her supporters were in the '08 primaries.  ",2,0,1444335693,1444717104

Any SC appointment is going to be contentious.  I don't think anyone will be able to make the case that he's not qualified. ",5,0,1444330785,1444717104

cvrhi4c,0,t1_cvrgs7f,prizepig,"Well...  that's what the ANCAPs would say and it's one way to look at things.  

The opposite side of that argument is that *some* government spending offers a much higher ROI over the very long term than anything the market would support. Also, that some level of government spending actually improves the efficiency and profitability of the whole system.   Furthermore, that some government spending enhances our quality of life in ways that the market would not sufficiently address.

For me, it's not really a discussion about waste.  It's a discussion about priorities.   We as a society get to adjust those long-term priorities every few years.",3,0,1444239013,1444717104
cvrg943,1,t3_3nuyrs,prizepig,"Hard to say.  It depends a whole lot on your perspective.   

Here's one thing to think about.   When the government spends money on anything it can't really be ""wasted.""  That money doesn't get destroyed or anything.  It just goes into someone else's pocket.   It pay's salaries, it buys things from companies, it gets recirculated back into the economy.  

When people talk about wasteful spending, they're generally just talking about the government spending money on things they don't like.",4,0,1444237210,1444717104

I don't view the assault weapons ban as much of a ""ban"" on anything.   It doesn't do anything to change the functional usefulness of a firearm for self-defense or sporting purposes.   ",1,0,1444160013,1444717104

BBC is consistently excellent in their reporting of the news.   But that was the unedited viewpoints of four individuals.
