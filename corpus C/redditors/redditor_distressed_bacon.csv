cvx4uuk,0,t1_cvx3rhz,distressed_bacon,"Ha, and looking into this further the website is joke. http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/ looks like it hasn't been updated since the mid 90's.  Let alone the specific website used as the cite does not exist. Also it does not list ""crime"" data before 1960 so we have no idea where they are getting their numbers from before then. I also believe this is the rate for violent crime as homicide rate is not even listed on the website. ",1,0,1444672071,1444717484

I understand that it is a rate, but it means nothing if their is no context.  Is it per 100, 1000, 10000,100000000 that's what I am trying to find out.  And the fact that it isn't sourced says something, that is research 101, don't trust un-sourced information. ",2,0,1444670889,1444717484
cvx3l9v,1,t3_3ogyn8,distressed_bacon,"No it is not.  The article makes no reference to the graph what so ever, even in the original article from ""the blaze"".  The graph is not even correctly cited let alone not having axis labeling.  The X axis is obviously years but what is the Y axis?  Where is this data coming from?  I am sure gun laws are not the only attributing factor in homicides, there is probably a lot more at play here. ",5,0,1444670225,1444717484

cvvw0iy,1,t3_3oc9y3,distressed_bacon,A lot of the older rowing machines are still great.  They are very simple with less gizmos but gives you resistance where you want it. My uncle has had his for 30+ years and still works great.  Sometimes all you need to do is add a little lube and they are back in shape (pun intended) in no time.,1,0,1444579530,1444717484
