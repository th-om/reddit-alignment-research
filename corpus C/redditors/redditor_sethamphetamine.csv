cvvszh8,1,t3_3oba5t,sethamphetamine,"How would one go about pruning that's Aqua Forest tank?  I mean, my much simpler 20Gal tank is SO hard to prune yet this looks much harder.  It looks like once this tank grows it'll never look this good again because you'll never be able to prune it back to this.  Right?",1,0,1444573190,1444726652

My only option is to finish it then, put a half finished bottle on a table where it disappears within that hour or hopefully I have my belt where I have my bottle holder. ",5,0,1444434202,1444726652

cvua376,0,t1_cvu5muf,sethamphetamine,"I understand your argument, but it assumes those who aren't rich aren't so because they've squandered their money, while the brilliant wealthy have figured out to not do so. But this obviously isn't the case. People mostly are born into these classes of haves and have nots. And the majority of our expenses are non-discretionary. Even my families $175 cell bill is a prerequisite for survival, as is education and health care and food. Even superficial items like name brand clothing to be respected at your job. I would even argue keeping your kids relevant with social luxuries like sports, entertainment, and technology is necessary to not alienate them from those who are successful.  

But to say the rich only exist because of the poor is backwards on so many levels. ",0,0,1444433201,1444726652
cvu3uyj,0,t1_cvu2pa1,sethamphetamine,"I guess either you think you deserve luxuries, or you realize it's sad you can afford it while others can barely survive.  Not sure how else to put it.  It's an economic issue and like the pope said, at least in America we worship money. It's not hard to see why when people covet such luxuries while others are struggling so hard.  I don't think any person should be able to make 1000x more than another person...ever",-1,0,1444422580,1444726652
cvtyfyi,0,t1_cvtto2e,sethamphetamine,There are reasons others like myself disagree with you.  I live in a very wealthy city and work for and am surrounded by people who openly insult and look down upon the only lifestyle I can afford.  I do have contempt for this and watch these people as they spend more on an hour shopping (or a flight on one of these flights) then I will earn in a month.  But the real kicker is that ALL these luxuries don't make them any happier.  In the end they complain just as much as anyone else struggling.  Is it wrong I call these people snobs?  Is it wrong they can afford pilates and yoga clases AND a 1st class ticket when I can't afford health insurance?,2,0,1444414465,1444726652

cvqdpjv,0,t1_cvq3001,sethamphetamine,"Thanks for explaining yourself. Although that measure is the statutory corporate income tax rate and our discussion involves more than simple tax laws but very clever manipulating by corporate lawyers who clearly aren't doing what's best for the country as a whole (that wouldn't be proper capitalism).  So my argument would be yes, the middle class is f'd as you say. I own a corporation myself and no one in my company is able to manipulate these tax laws to my advantage. So it is about the wealthy, not just individuals but wealthy corporations. And yes hurting them will hurt the middle class more in the short term because they essentially own us. But like the 1700's they need to be checked...hard. 

the rich don't need to and won't simply leave without a fight, not if they can have it their way and pass the costs of the manipulation down to us consumers. ",2,0,1444157058,1444726652
