cvxx0ot,1,t3_3oj7fk,cdstephens,"I'm assuming you refer to Young's experiment. Only one light source is used because that's all that is needed. According to the wave theory of light, any space filled with light is filled correspondingly with EM waves. EM waves emitted as a Gaussian beam, a spherical wave, or what have you will generally expand out and not remain, for example, a straight line. This will enable it to come across multiple slits at once. Once that happens, using Huygen's principle and approximate theories of waves and optics, you can treat the system as if two wave are propagating out of your slits, one for each slit. They have to be close together for you to note interference. I believe the angular spacing of noticeable fringes goes as 1/d, where d is the distance between the slits. If d is too big, the light might not hit both slits, and the fringe spacing will be so small the fringes will blur together.",1,0,1444720084,1444725218
cvwqnhc,1,t3_3ofaf6,cdstephens,"Gravity has an ""infinite range"" so to speak, just like electromagnetism. As long as the object is within the observable universe, it is exerting a gravitational force on us (since gravity travels at the speed of light). Because gravity takes a finite amount of time to travel, there's a retarded time involved in the calculation of how much force is exerted in what direction I believe. For example, if the Sun were to vanish, it would take 8 minutes before the Earth effectively realized that and stopped feeling its gravitational pull.",2,0,1444638064,1444725218
