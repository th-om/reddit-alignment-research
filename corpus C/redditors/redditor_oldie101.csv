That doesn't mean the three days we shared together, touring the city, exploring & building an emotional connection weren't worth it.

If you just get of a long term relationship, you aren't looking for another one, you are looking to find yourself. Finding someone at the wrong time, doesn't mean you have to remove the emotions you feel and share with them. I didn't and it made my experience more enjoyable & there's as well.

cvsmnrp,0,t1_cvshqii,oldie101,"I think you've touched on something here that is rarely ever talked about, but something I as a male can relate to. When I was single my ""goal"" if you can call it that was to go out and try to experience life & meet girls. My agenda was never to have sex (although many nights did conclude that way) it was to learn about a new person and spend time with them and laugh and just make each other happy. 

I guess your definition of it is better than mine, ""a brief moment of emotional connection"" is really what I was after. It felt great being wanted and it felt great making someone else happy and that was the mindset I was in. 

For a lot of people both male & female they didn't understand me, and didn't believe me when I tried to convey that this was my goal. Some of my male friends who were only worried about getting laid, thought I was doing the same and just denying it. My female friends thought that I was being a jerk for leading girls on and that I shouldn't try to build those emotional connections. 

But the people that I met and the experiences that I had, felt way more real & emotionally fulfilling by being able to keep the emotions in the relationship; even if it wouldn't last that long. For the most part the girls understood that I wasn't looking for a long term relationship & they too could appreciate the connection even if it was temporary. 

I must admit though that some girls thought that me being emotional with them was an indication that I wanted something long term & for them I think they felt duped. 

I wish more people would eliminate the divide between their emotional & physical selfs and allow them to intertwine, even if it is only for a little while. It definitely made my time with the ladies I was with way more enjoyable.",13,0,1444321861,1444721429
cvr7ro4,0,t1_cvqni3l,oldie101,"Common are you for real? You really believe people aren't offering to donate to the front-runner of the GOP?

Trump has claimed he has turned down millions from many special interest groups, and I believe him. 

His appeal & campaign are positioned on anti-establishment policies. He is against policies that make politicians puppets for their donors. 

It makes no sense for him to change that position, as it is one of the reasons the shift of the voting public has been to back non-political candidates. People are tired of voting for people who have to decide what their biggest donors want *couch* Solyndra *cough* Halliburton*. They want someone who will act on their own accord, even if that means it won't necessarily be in the people's best interest.At least, they can take solace in knowing the opinion is real and not paid for.",1,0,1444223400,1444721429
cvr7gc9,0,t1_cvqrq4u,oldie101,"I'm not sure what you are implying. If you think I want the banks to have gotten away with this atrocity than you are mistaken. If you think I believed the banks should have been bailed out you are mistaken. 

If you are saying that policies that allowed for the housing/mortgage collapse are a product of ""conservative"" policies and therefore Republicans should be blamed, then you are not wrong. 

However the conversation about why people haven't been persecuted for these actions rather than why did these actions occur are two different conversations. The former comes with the reality that Holder & Obama allowed them to get away with it. The latter comes from lax lending practices supported by both sides in Congress. Giving poor people the opportunity to buy property was a Democratically held perspective. As was allowing banks to lend more than they earned being a Republican one. ",1,0,1444222685,1444721429

The poor lady seems to be the only sober one here. At least she took off her gloves when the Kangaroo started fucking her. You know if she was really that drunk, the gloves would have stayed on. ",17,0,1444159246,1444721429

The reality is, that these banks and individuals were able to get away with these atrocities because of two people. Eric Holder & Barack Obama.

Holder allowed for these slaps on the wrists and comedic fines instead of actually holding anyone accountable. Obama allowed him to employ that kind of ""justice"". Why? 

Simple, people with money have influence in politics & that influence is exactly what Holder & Obama are a product of. No matter how many people want to believe otherwise, they were bought and paid for. 

[This Rolling Stone article](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-9-billion-witness-20141106) enlightened me on the realities of the obstruction of justice unlike any other. I suggest anyone who doesn't believe that Holder & Obama should be the people vilified to read it.
