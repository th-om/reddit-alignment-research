Handguns are banned and the same applies to semi auto rifles chambered in calibers over .22lr. The rest is pretty much allowed, even though there's strict gun laws.

So no. Guns are NOT banned in the UK, only certain guns are. Gun crime is rare, but still exists, which you claimed that ""nobody gets shot ever"" which is also false.

Man, at least have some consistency with your bullshit, instead of moving goal posts.",-5,0,1444679200,1444719979

You are the one that assumes that laws magically prevent people from doing something bad.

The fact is, this law about allowing CC permit holders to take their guns will not increase or decrease his chance of getting shot for the simple fact that if someone wants to shoot him inside his classroom, it's not going to be the law that will magically protect him or make the guy that wants to carry the gun to kill him (considering that murder is far worse than illegally carrying a gun) think twice before doing it.

 Let me put this to simpler terms:

>I'm mad and I want to shoot the professor!

>Oh good! Thankfully there is a law that allows me to carry a gun legally so that I can murder him in cold blood!

Or

>I'm mad and I want to shoot the professor!

>Oh shit, there's no law that allows me to legally carry a gun inside the classroom! I guess I won't be able to murder him!

Is it clear how stupid it is?

Laws exist so that we can punish people and prevent *some* people into breaking the law because of the punishment.

Now if you look at this law you will see that it will not increase the risk of the professor getting shot by a deranged student since this student would shoot him regardless of the law that exists. Not to mention that anyone that wants to illegally carry a gun in that zone will do it regardless of the CC law.

See it like this, the death penalty exists in the USA and that still doesn't prevent people from killing each other even fully knowing that severe punishment awaits them.",11,0,1444675284,1444719979
cvx62o2,1,t3_3oh76v,Zorthianator,"Let me try to understand your logic OP:

>CC is banned in classrooms

Nobody gets shot at because we all know that someone that wants to murder a teacher, will not carry his gun to do it because of the law that prohibits it.

>CC is allowed

Suddenly anyone wanting to murder the teacher will have an easy time doing it because somehow this law suddenly allows students to carry guns.

I'm sorry, but your logic is flawed. ",-12,0,1444673823,1444719979
