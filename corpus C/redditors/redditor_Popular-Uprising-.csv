Semantics. They were not taxed before. They are now taxed. That is new. Whether or not it's a new law that creates the tax or the lapsing of an old law is really irrelevant. The fact that they are taxed is new and that's more than enough justification to call it a new tax. ",0,0,1444662357,1444727211

cvshbqc,0,t1_cvs5pzg,Popular-Uprising-,"All major market actions like these are reactionary. There's no reason to increase production greatly unless you see a market condition that you think can be corrected by your actions. There was no way they could know how much oil could be produced by fracking and new exploration until it came online. And there was no way to know that the profitability price point was going to be until it was fully up and running. 

Fracking is not any more responsible for the current price war than any other type of oil production. Global demand and high oil prices drove producers to innovate new ways of obtaining the oil. Once they did, they produced oil. The problem is that, below a certain price point, fracking isn't cost effective. Since SA could easily increase production and their production costs are very low, they increased production to drive the global price of oil down and hopefully drive some of their competition out of business. 

SA absolutely has that ability. They are, once again, the number 1 producer of oil in the world and can produce it at a much cheaper price than their rivals. In 2014, the US overtook them as the #1 producer and SA can force many US companies our of business. ",2,0,1444313702,1444727211
