cvxb300,0,t1_cvxazhw,MMAPhreak21,"Trust me, unless you do business amounts of shipping, UPS and Fedex are both worse. And by business amounts, I mean like Amazon level business. I was the shipping guy at my alma mater's warehouse for like six months, and you would not believe how expensive it is to UPS or Fedex something. The Postal Service has always been entirely reasonable to me, except for one time, but I blame that on the fact that I used a kiosk instead of a human.",3,0,1444681011,1444730928
cvxas26,0,t1_cvxabqx,MMAPhreak21,"I'll be honest, that's not something I have experience with; I mainly ever ship media mail type stuff (books, music, movies, video games). The potential for variable weight is kinda screwing my mind up, but I'd still say you just get a big bubble mailer and stick everything in there (add padding where desired to ensure stuff doesn't break). As a general rule the only reasons to go flat rate are if you're literally shipping rocks (less snarky answer: you have a crazy amount of weight in a small amount of space) or if you're shipping cross country or to Alaska or Hawai'i.",3,0,1444680586,1444730928
cvxajdh,1,t3_3ofs7q,MMAPhreak21,"Bought me an air purifier from Walmart. Cost me $40 three days before payday but it was totally worth it for the fact that I no longer feel like I lose two minutes off my life per minute if I'm in my apartment during peak people times (the ventilation system kind of sucks and I'm constantly smelling other people's cig smoke).

To answer the QOTD, I can't honestly think of a show that I could bring back and have it be at the level it was. Most shows I feel like get canceled when they should; if anything most shows tend to go too long. For example, there was a short lived dramedy on NBC called Harry's Law. It starred Kathy Bates and the first season was hilarious. The second season, however, got super political and it wasn't funny anymore.",2,0,1444680240,1444730928
cvxa8ky,0,t1_cvxa2ws,MMAPhreak21,"I've done a bunch of shipping for eBay and Amazon, and in my experience the flat rate boxes are almost never a good deal. I'd just go with the normal option in like a bubble mailer or something. What are you shipping exactly?",3,0,1444679803,1444730928

cvwcjbe,1,t3_3odyiu,MMAPhreak21,Agreed 100%. I think I saw more PAs than actual run plays (though to be fair the Raiders' front 4 is pretty good).,9,0,1444606201,1444730928
