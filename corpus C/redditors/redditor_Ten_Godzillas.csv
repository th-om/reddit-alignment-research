We have a deal. One person wakes up with the baby but gets free time later in the day. Basically, One person gets to sleep in for 3 hours (including nap time) and whoever wakes up gets 3 hours of personal time (other than basic things like making bottles).  

It's worked out really well for us so far",1,0,1444697392,1444731930
cvxl76m,1,t3_3ofkhb,Ten_Godzillas,"My stroller was about 80$, it's stylish and it collapses to fit in the trunk. Taking my baby on a walk in this thing is one of my baby's favorite activities. He gets almost 2-3 long walks in it every day and it's still going strong. Any stroller costing more than 150$ is a status symbol

Take that 1020$ and buy clothes for the next five years
