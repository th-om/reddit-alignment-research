cvvkbzg,0,t1_cvtu7zx,MorningLtMtn,This would only be true if the media didn't cover the debate. The net gain is the actual policy debate itself. Politics is about the jockeying and exercise of power. A lot of these debates would be relatively easy to win. It turns out that killing babies past certain stages of development isn't really that popular with a lot of voters. I'd like to see Obama veto regulations that would protect the innocent. I'd like that debate in the public conscious.,0,0,1444541363,1444722383

If you want an example of what's possible, take a look at what the Tea Party actually achieved, not pretend achieved. First, they swept Congress putting people with their beliefs in both the Senate and the House, removing Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid. And replacing them with establishment Republicans, but Republicans none the less. Then they chased out the next establishment Republican in line, Eric Cantor, and replaced him with one of their own.

Then, they chased out the House leader and opened up the speakers position at the same time. Then they made the current replacement party leader emasculate himself chasing him out of the speakers position, and weakening his leadership in the process. Now they're going to force the establishment to install their preferred candidate, Daniel Webster, who they believe is a moderate voice that will at least give them a seat at the table.

If Occupy Wall Street achieved anything valuable, I haven't seen what it is.",2,0,1444512385,1444722383

cvv2few,1,t3_3o6eq3,MorningLtMtn,"Seems to be politics to me.  It doesn't bother me.

The truth is that Rand is a candidate that is unique in his positions, and the establishment and its media is going to do everything they can to make him look bad.  It doesn't help that the campaign completely mismanaged how to handle Trump, and continues to.  They should've been using Trump as a battering ram, pointing out where he (Trump) supports Rand's positions, and showing that he can work across enemy lines by highlighting where we agree.  When Rand ultimately loses, it's going to be because he never took advantage of the real opportunity in this environment and went with politics as usual.",2,0,1444506859,1444722383
cvv21ru,0,t1_cvv1sfg,MorningLtMtn,"So goes politics.  Nobody wants to support the guy that is trying to remove them from power. As always, in the end, the side with the most power wins, and the only way they do is by exerting their power. Again, I don't see the irony, just the dance.",2,0,1444506163,1444722383
