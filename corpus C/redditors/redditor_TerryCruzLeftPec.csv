I think that my point is still valid even though we've shifted from 0.08% to 0.2% of the population being directly affected by this new law.  I think it comes down to thinking logically and in the demographics. What percentage of the 70,000 CCW holders are active college students?  Also, the point of the law is mostly irrelevant because if you are an effective conceal carry individual, no one will know you are doing so.  I carried at my University (with a CCW) even though there were policies against doing so.  In my opinion, having the option to possibly save a my own life and/or that of others far outweighed the possibility of expulsion.  ",1,1,1444695231,1444723147
