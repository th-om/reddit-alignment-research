>I was wondering how exactly those countries are able to give free health care and college education to all of their citizens and what it would take to do the same in America?

By taking more from the working taxpayers so the slackers and freeloaders can get it free or subsidized.

If the govt taxes it's employees 50% of their wages do they still pay taxes if the govt said from now on they have to pay no federal taxes but take a 50% pay cut?

The answer is No. They dont pay federal taxes. 


Govt employees paying back the what the govt gave them is not them paying taxes. It's an accounting slight of hand. The govt received no new tax revenue from it's own.",0,0,1443223479,1444728174

> Your statement can only be true if sperm and egg are not alive. As I pointed out to you, they are alive. You have offered nothing to indicate that sperm and egg are not alive.

If and when you take Jr High biology, you will learn it's not a human being until it has all of it's DNA from both the mother and father.

And I never said either of the two were not alive. What the two are separately, prior to conception, is not a human being. Do you understand that?


Maybe you need to look up the definition of conception with regard to biology.
