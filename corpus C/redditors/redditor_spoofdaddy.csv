After all, offering another affordable option to travel cross country quickly will lower prices for both trains and planes. Additionally, trains can be run on a variety of fuel sources, will reduce human airport traffic and wait times, be affordable, and fuel job growth in an underdeveloped industry.

cvmppbp,1,t3_3nc5cj,spoofdaddy,"A lot of the issues of gun ownership in America comes from the fact that anyone can own a gun. Guns have a utility for many people, but I don't see any problem with individuals who have an abnormal psychology to be denied a gun. Additionally, I think it would also be helpful if people who owned large numbers of guns to be required to join a gun club. That way, they have to interact with other gun owners and that would hopefully lessen the chance of them doing a crazy thing in isolation (I am assuming most gun owners are not crazy, which is my experience)",1,0,1443879782,1444719881

cv7zg3p,0,t1_cv7p41l,spoofdaddy,"This is a good point, and illustrates one of my problems with Egoism. One of the things taken as an implicit in the discussion of Egoism is the existence of rational self-interest (something OP doesn't discuss overtly), and the majority of the arguments that lie within the defense of Egoism are based on rational agents. The problem is that no where should it be required that any agent act in a ""traditionally rational"" way if pursuing their own self-interested happiness, and the idea seems contradictory to the tenets of Egoism. (Traditionally rational meaning that the agent acted reasonably after evaluating all given scenarios.)

In fact, rationality itself should be up for grabs, since the whole framework of an Egoistic agent does not extend outside of the agent. This means that the rational beliefs of one agent should not extend to another. We then need to assume there are more than one agents to validate the idea of agent independence, which means there can be an infinite number of frameworks in any system. As an example, perhaps the man who killed his wife was acting rationally within his framework because he believed it was his only way out of a situation of non-optimal happiness for himself. His belief may not be a traditionally rational one, but within the context of his framework it was and we have no way to compare his rationality to a larger rationality since the framework only exists within the agent. 

This is where the real problem of Egoism lies, in my opinion. Assuming Agents operate with independent frameworks and assuming their actions extend outside their own physical selves, an observer would have no way of comparing one framework to the next. ~~The problem with this is that it would render any empirical observation within the system meaningless, and we would have no way to tell fact from fiction. Cue the dissolution of any logical human construct.~~ This means that any assumption of rational vs. irrational actions are irrelevant since there is no definition of it that can exist for an entire system.

Edit: I should clarify that the frameworks mentioned are based on an Agent construct of a system's absolute reality. This is drawn from Ayn Rand's Objectivism, although I'm not sure if Egoism in general agrees with these ideas.

Edit 2: I took it too far with the claim of deconstructing reality. After grounding my claims in an absolute reality, I can see that Agent constructs will not effect truth or facts.",3,0,1442766591,1444719881
