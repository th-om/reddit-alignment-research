ago, and well, let's just say, trying to get news on the Warriors is
almost impossible...just recently discovered reddit...yep, I am old...

part of the reason to compose this target was based to one of the
commentators during one of the playoff games...I think it was 
Jeff Van Gundy, and he was arguing that the rules needed to be
changed to prevent the hack a Howard or whomever...and of course,
my brain melted...switch to under hand free throws...there is no
need to change the rules of the game due to poor free throw 
shooters and the ""hack a"" tactics...fix the players to fit into the
rules...

ya, that one game Iguodala was 1 for 10 or something like that..
awful, yet his free throw average is good.  the wheels came off
during that stretch...it happens...let's switch to all players should
be capable to do the underhand free throws, or something like that..",2,0,1442415963,1444731856
curlz01,1,t3_3jr0cc,VaughnIlato,"ok' let us take a walk down this path which appears to suggest something positive for team Clinton.  the argument here appears to be that team Clinton paid for the maintenance, administration, and support for the clintonemail server, and as such this server arraingment did not cost the government and taxpayers anything to use this external server operation.  Team Clintons message here is ""all is good here"".  

now let us transport ourselves to the current state of the cost of the clintonemail server, and that cost is that we (the taxpayers) are paying for a team of forensic experts to analyze the clintonemail server to minimally determine if there we national security exposures due to the clintonemail server.

how much is that team of experts costing ?  is team Clinton paying for the cost of the forensic team ?  ",2,0,1441470773,1444731856
