As long as he keep playing by the rules, he's never able to see true justice done and never able to stop Butler, only when he accepts the necessity of working outside the law is he able to win.  Butler's character dies, but only because he's successfully made the point he was trying to make.  His legacy lives on after his sacrifice.",10,0,1444691607,1444725146

Luke calls himself a Jedi, but wears black.  In contrast to the Jedi teachings, during the final battle with Vader he fights with anger strong enough for Vader and Palpatine to sense.  But he doesn't let it consume him like it did Anakin.  Unlike a Jedi, he's able to face his emotional side, but unlike a Sith he's able to master himself and resist the Dark Side.

The old way was the two sides of the force in conflict with each other, the ambition of the Sith and the sterility of the Jedi always standing opposed to each other, never being able to find a balance between the two.  Anakin resolves it by eliminating both sides and leaving behind a new breed of Jedi that doesn't fall into the pitfalls of either side of the old conflict.",0,0,1444676962,1444725146

I think a lot of the is kinda entangled with environmentalism.  People don't like mother nature being screwed with.  But the cattle, chickens, pigs, and other domestic animals that we raise for food aren't part of 'nature', so it doesn't really matter to their minds.",2,0,1444610908,1444725146

They've convinced themselves that if *they* can just stand up to us evil patriarchal gamergaters that all will become right and good in the world.  The people in the developing world don't need to have a part in it, because it's rich white men that are the problem, and it's the valiant SJW's who are going to put an end to their reign of terror and drive them out of the hall of power.  The only thing the poor brown people need to do is express a satisfactory degree of reverence and adulation towards their noble saviors.

The sad part is I'm not even joking, it's exactly the sort of mentality these people have, they're in some sense trying to live out a fantasy in which they get to be the noble crusading knight errant who delivers the helpless victim from oppression and is praised as a hero for it.",2,0,1444270162,1444725146
