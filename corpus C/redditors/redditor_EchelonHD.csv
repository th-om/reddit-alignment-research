I would be more sympathetic with this except I feel Hillary Clinton may be one of the most advantaged presidential candidate ever. She's the frontrunner that is clearly not suppressed. Its kind of baffling that some of her supporters would try taking out this argument. I thinks that's a part of the backlash against her.

If it were any other woman in the field (be it Bachmann, Fiorina, Warren, Pelosi, etc.), I would maybe buy this and say she fought a hard fight to get where she was. But Clinton? No, she's the epitome of privilege.

They will open dozens of accounts and then write fake responses to their own threads. They're paid to do this as their job and accounts of former employees are well documented on the internet. 

When it comes to blue chips and other ordinary stocks, advice from online strangers is probably good intentioned even if the advice might not be good. When it comes to penny stocks, it's highly highly likely that they're scammers.",6,0,1444559235,1444720107

cvsojnd,0,t1_cvrbnzy,EchelonHD,"I think the success of the Surface line isn't due to an influx of Apple users; but, from deeper pocketed current Window users that have finally discovered hardware they are willing to pay a premium for. 

Its a much bigger market than most probably realize. Remember that the average price of computers was >$1000 not long ago (ex. $1300 in 2001) so there are a lot of Americans that can afford better computers but choose to stick with a $500 Windows machine. Hence the high growth of the Surface and the potential for a lot more growth.

Stealing users from Apple is not the primary goal.",2,0,1444324625,1444720107
