cvvc1zs,1,t3_3o9zvd,dadofseven,I worked in a beef slaughtering house 30 years ago. The cow got knocked out. Then as he was hung up and his jugular was cut and he bled to death. Didn't take long. And of course the cow was knocked out. Don't think this was painful.,1,0,1444524852,1444721758
cvk4i56,1,t3_3n19j0,dadofseven,"I'm a conservative. I like to give opinions.

    What do you think about negative income tax as opposed to something like raising the minimum wage?
- I don't like income redistribution. Everyone should work for what they want. I would rather see group homes, institutions, schools providing meals. Than giving people money. 
    What do you think about the amount of money going into the US defense budget? I think the money spent here is fine, maybe not used wisely. This is the only thing the federal gov't should be doing in my opinion.

    What is your opinion on Citizens United?
-  I don't follow it, but it seams like a good thing to me.
    What do you think about the gradually decreasing public funding of the sciences/academia?
- I like money going to science projects. Unless is for projects like "" why do men get boners?"" You know what I mean?

    How would you feel about a stricter separation of church and state? I think a country acknowledging a higher power is a wonderful thing.  

    What do you think of publicly funded research involving psychedelic substances? Originally when these were new, Yes. Now? No. I think there's plenty of examples of what drugs do by now.

    What do you think about Planned Parenthood in its current state?
- I'm pro lifer so this part (abortions) of pp I don't like. But the Supremes ruled on this a long time ago so... The rest of PP provides many good services. 
 What do you think are better alternatives if you disagree with its current implementation. 
- Again, I'm a pro lifer. 
- I'm more irritated at the amount of money that the leadership makes. Just google the salaries. OMG. You know when folks complain about poor salaries in this country, then you see this. Sad. I would go so far as to say the fight is really about their salaries.... being cut.",-1,0,1443669482,1444721758
cvk3ngj,1,t3_3myrqd,dadofseven,It's about women's health. The health of the PP leadership salaries. These folks make damn good money. Looked up salaries on the internet. Holy crap batman!! ,0,0,1443667901,1444721758
cvhj80v,1,t3_3mqked,dadofseven,I think PP is a big whiny butt. They don't need gov't donations. Looks like they got plenty a cash anyways. The gov't should get out of all welfare and entitlements. ,-62,0,1443486586,1444721758
cvhep98,0,t1_cvh64d1,dadofseven,"And I don't think any non profit should get gov't funding for this very reason. OMG...it would be one less fucking point to argue about....Just think if the gov't didn't hand out any money..by gosh, we'd prob be all board to death...",-11,0,1443478779,1444721758
cvhec5v,0,t1_cvh31gj,dadofseven,I luv it when I can put my opinion out on the internet and get attacked and name called by folks. Really does prove your point. America is a fucked up place. Peace bro!!,-10,0,1443478171,1444721758
cvh2jq7,1,t3_3moxl6,dadofseven,"While I'm a pro-lifer, I see no need to shut down planned parenthood. I just don't think the gov't needs to fund it. It's a non-profit. They can get all the funding they need from their supporters just like all other non-profits do. And if they continue to sell parts of babies, they should have their non-profit stripped from them. I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet. The scheme to link the gov't not giving support to them to not performing abortions is a clever one. And if the baby killers don't want to donate cash on their own after gov't support is taken away, then I guess that shows what they really think. ",-37,0,1443460817,1444721758
cvffv3o,1,t3_3mha09,dadofseven,My take with 30 years and seven kids of primary education. Universities teach what you need to start the career of your choice. The primary education system teaches you everything you don't need for most anything you will do. ,0,0,1443322485,1444721758
