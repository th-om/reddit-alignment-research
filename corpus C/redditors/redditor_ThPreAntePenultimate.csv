cvj3oj9,1,t3_3mxgy4,ThPreAntePenultimate,"I ended up with a perfect storm of conditions to make this happen. We were fighting a red dragon, and my Paladin had just acquired an icy burst longbow (STR +3). I decided to smite evil against the dragon with a shot from my bow, just to get it active for the coming fight. I rolled a nat 20 with the bow. Sweet, automatic hit, so Smite is active. I roll to confirm the critical, roll an 18 crit is confirmed.

Longbows are a x3 multiplier on the damage so I got to roll the d8 +9 for the arrow and critical strength. A d10 for the icy burst (which got 50% more damage because icy burst vs. a fire dragon). And last, but certainly not least I got to add my smite damage (8) x3 because of the confirmed critical.

I ended up dealing about 65 damage to the dragon with one arrow, which meant I made the dragon roll a save against massive damage. With one hit. It turned out that the dragon made the save against massive damage, but still I made that happen with one arrow.",3,0,1443603752,1444727484
