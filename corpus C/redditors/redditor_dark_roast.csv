cvx91iz,0,t1_cvwu6zt,dark_roast,"Personally, the only thing I like about wearing a helmet (aside from the safety issue) is that my hair fares better than if I were to go without. My hair is very fine, and in the wind it just whips all over the fuck. With a helmet it's a little gnarled after a good ride. Without, it looks like I'm hooked up to a Van de Graaff generator.

Very much depends on your hairstyle, though.",1,0,1444678111,1444726200
cvvzril,0,t1_cvvfaij,dark_roast,"That's pretty close to [what happened between the end of WWII and the early 00s](http://brookstonbeerbulletin.com/budweiser-admits-flavor-drifted-over-the-years/). The big macrobrewers came to power and were able to, slowly, drift the flavor of their beers to be weaker, which meant they were both cheaper to make and easier to drink (so customers would drink more). And since they had huge war chests for advertising and could control distribution to an extent, they were able to dominate. This left a huge untapped market of people who wanted better beer.

cvu9nv4,0,t1_cvu8j35,dark_roast,"Oh, agreed. IMO, best for Orcas and SW would be for the project to have gone forward (increasing space for the Orcas) with caps on the number of Orcas they can keep in that space. This would create a de facto limit on breeding, ensuring a minimum amount of space per whale, but wouldn't set an expiration date on the utility of their expansion.

As-is, I don't know why SW would go forward with the project. Admittedly, I haven't watched Blackfish and I don't have a strong opinion one way or another. Sea World is big employer in San Diego, and I like having them here, but I get the objections in terms of animal welfare.",4,0,1444432415,1444726200
