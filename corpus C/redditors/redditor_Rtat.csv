cvxk0t7,1,t3_3oi689,Rtat,"Here's what I believe will eventually happen:

Paul will get out, partly because of money, partly to focus on keeping his senate seat.  

Carson will slowly overtake Trump by saying crazier stuff and since so much of Trump's support is predicated on him being a winner and everyone else being a loser, the second he starts losing the floor will fall out from under him. Trump will get out, go back to his business and hold an important endorsement. 

Carson will say something crazy that finally sticks and destroys him or just get out on his own because his campaign is really just a book tour. 

Now, let's talk lanes. 

There's the Iowa lane (Santorum 2012), the New Hampshire lane (McCain 2008) and the broad lane (Romney 2012).

In the Iowa lane we have Huckabee, Jindal, Santorum and Cruz. If none of these candidates are able to strongly establish themselves Rubio will hold a very breakable lead here, a breakout would still be possible right at the end. I think Cruz has the best shot followed by Jindal then Huckabee and finally Santorum to come out of the Iowa lane. 

The New Hampshire lane includes Kasich, Christie and maybe Fiorina (Fiorina could possibly play broad). A last second breakout CAN NOT occur in New Hampshire if one occurs in Iowa. The Iowa breakout star will eat up too much available momentum (Santorum did it to Huntsman in '12). However, someone could still establish themselves as the probable winner early like Huckabee did in Iowa in 2008. The most likely to do this is Kasich followed by Fiorina then Christie. 

The broad lane includes Rubio, Bush and maybe Fiorina. Rubio has positioned himself very well to have the most delegates after the first three states and has Norman Braman backing him who hates Bush and is willing to put up 20 million dollars. He has also positioned himself well to get the Sheldon Adelson money, Rubio is currently his favorite. Finally, the Koch brothers are eyeing Rubio, that's huge. Bush already has the money to go long, but does he have the political skill? Fiorina is also being eyed by the Kochs and other big money backers. She also seems to have the political skill, but her background may hurt her. I believe there is room for two candidates to come from this lane and I believe it will Rubio and Bush. 

I believe the final four will be Rubio, Bush, Cruz and Kasich/Fiorina.  Rubio will win.

cvxihg6,1,t3_3oi689,Rtat,"I don't think Fiorina is a true outsider like Carson and Trump from what I've seen. I believe most of her support would go to establishment candidates. Additionally, a lot of Trump and Carson supporters aren't necessarily set on having an outsider. Anecdote, but my Dad's favorite right now is Trump and Rubio is his number two ",1,0,1444692275,1444720047
