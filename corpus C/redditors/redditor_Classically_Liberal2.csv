This is where being both ideologically libertarian *and* utilitarian is a bit of a nightmare, the best I can come up with is that ideally we would allow this (and definitely sometime in the future this should be allowed) but right now I think there are too many issues.  I'd have no problem if someone could just switch to another store and get the same product at a similar price, but I worry about rural area consumers and people who don't have many options, as well as businesses taking advantage of this to hike prices up on certain demographics that are discriminated against elsewhere in the area.

>Should the government require health insurance companies to provide free birth control?

No

>Should the federal government continue to give tax credits and subsidies to the wind power industry? 

I don't have problems with across the board credits, but I am opposed to the government selecting which companies get the subsidies.  So these would have to apply to all or none.  I'd prefer a carbon tax though.

>Should employers be required to pay men and women, who perform the same work, the same salary?

No, that's a sure way to get bigoted employers to stop hiring women.  If they think men are inherently more valuable, they aren't going to hire women if they cost the same.  Also, this seems like a nightmare to determine who is being paid correctly/underpaid.  Isn't the main cause of the wage gap the fact that employers heavily penalize those who work less hours and have flexible schedules anyway (or for that matter would equal pay for equal work include those with flexible schedules, sort of fixing that issue)?  

>Should the government make cuts to public spending in order to reduce the national debt?

If by cut we mean from current projections, I'm definitely all for it.  If it means from current levels, I'm less certain because we do have a heavily aging population.  

>Should Wall Street executives be criminally charged for their roles in the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis?

No, this was a fuckup by just about everyone who had any involvement, public or private sector, and I really don't want to let the crazy populist anti-bank crowd to have any more ammo. 

>Do you believe labor unions help or hurt the economy?

I'd guess hurt but I don't really know.  I don't really have an issue with private sector unions regardless.  Public sector ones should be abolished.

>Should the government increase the tax rate on profits earned from the sale of stocks, bonds, and real estate?

No

>Should pension plans for federal, state and local government workers be transitioned into private plans?

Yes

>Would you favor an increased sales tax in order to reduce property taxes?

No, property taxes are less distortionary and more progressive.  What would be the benefit of this? 

>Should internet service providers be allowed to prioritize traffic for websites that pay higher rates than their competitors?

Probably

>Do you support affirmative action programs?

I certainly don't agree with fellow libertarians that they aren't justified because they discriminate, while technically true if the outcome is remedying past discrimination, I don't see the problem.  My concern is with outcomes and who is benefitting?  Is it rich minorities or the truly unprivileged?  I'll hold off on voicing support for AA until I review some literature on how effective they are. 

>Should the government decrease military spending?


Yes

>Would you support increasing taxes on the rich in order to reduce interest rates for student loans? 

No

>Should illegal immigrants be given access to government-subsidized healthcare?

No

>Should illegal immigrants be offered in-state tuition rates at public colleges within their residing state?

Yes

>Should the government fund space travel? So that turned out to be a lot of questions.

Yes, we should also fund programs to deflect asteroids and comets.

Under the current system, there are a lot of [welfare cliffs](http://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2012/11/taxes-and-cliffs.html) that cause people who earn more to actually take home less money, because for every dollar earned, past a certain point, they end up losing more than a dollar of benefits.  So the main benefit of NIT is mainly to reduce the work disincentives caused by our mess of programs.

cvwkki3,0,t1_cvwfwlg,Classically_Liberal2,">Companies do not think, when calibrating wages, ""Will my employee be able to buy my product?""
There is no company big enough where this is a serious concern. The biggest American company, Walmart, which has 1 million employees, still has approximately 260 million other customers.
If we assume that there is no such thing as supply and demand in wages and Walmart decides to pay its employees $1 dollar an hour- it will have absolutely zero noticeable affect on their bottom line besides increasing profitability.
There is no company big enough that actually has to stop and think, ""Will my employees be able to purchase this?""

I think they're trying to imply a prisoner's dilemma here - if all companies paid their workers higher they'd all be better off following this logic (because of the higher demand), but for each individual company the incentive is to pay the least possible (as most of the money they pay will be spent on other companies' goods).  It's still nonsense, but it's not as bad as the Henry Ford boosting his workers wages to buy his cars theory of nonsense which you imply.  Pointing this out because I really want someone to make an accessible R1 of why this is wrong so I can link it, I'm not good at arguing why this is false.",1,0,1444620852,1444719371

cvvjk22,0,t1_cvvhi0j,Classically_Liberal2,">Although even that's a little disingenuous since politicians often campaign on platforms more exaggerated than that they actually implement.

I believe that is largely because they often have to compromise a bit to get bills passed.  If Sanders (and most politicians) had a congress that was willing to rubber-stamp whatever he wanted, I'd not be surprised if he'd be pushing for policies that are to left of Sweden.

>On a side note if you had Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders run against each other in any developed nation (including the US) which do you think would be considered far more extreme?

Obviously depends on the country one's running in.  In the US, Switzerland, Ireland, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other more right wing countries, Sanders would be the extremist.  In Sweden, Denmark, Finland, etc, Cruz would be.  I prefer using the US as a standard, given that we are discussing US politics, in which case Cruz would be considered far right and Sanders far left - but Sanders is a bit more extreme I think.

cvvje9t,0,t1_cvvf671,Classically_Liberal2,">In Sweden and Denmark most people have 49% to 60% of their income taxed. 48% of their GDP go to taxes.

And the top rate in Denmark is 60.2%, and roughly 57% in Sweden, yet Bernie favors a 90% rate.  The corporate tax is substantially lower in all of the Scandinavian countries, and Bernie wants to *raise* ours.  The taxes on the poor are much higher in Scandinavia (25% VATs, for example), Sanders as far as I know wants to keep them the same.  Capital gains are similar but Sanders wants to raise ours.

>If anything actively empowering unions like they do and having them so closely tied to government would put them to the left of Sanders, with maybe the exception of (some) trade policies.

How is a union-corporate negotiation of wages that varies by sector MORE left wing than a $15 minimum wage, I'm sorry you're just wrong.  One at least involves some negotiation process, the other is a direct regulation enforced on all sectors.  

>you're just calling him that because you don't like him.

No, I'm calling him that because that's what he is.  When he's advocating policies that are to the left of social democracies, which are to themselves left wing, he's far left.  I actually think you're the one who's refusing to admit this because you do like him, and his views reflect yours, and you just can't fathom that to most people, your views are considered extreme.
