cvhizn9,0,t1_cvgxc5k,asimpleenigma,I used to work at a college with a Barnes & Noble bookstore. Professors feared it like it was the Mafia. I knew of a few professors chastised for giving students alternatives to using the bookstore,1,0,1443486199,1444727714
cvdbqri,0,t1_cvdaozx,asimpleenigma,The rise of Obama and the bizarre debut of Sarah Palin were certainly interesting. But now you have Hillary now with 2 more scandals under her belt. The republican nominee will have the specter of Donald Trump looming over them. Even if he doesn't run as an independent god knows he will be talking shit on the sidelines for the entire election.,1,0,1443147560,1444727714
cvdafwc,0,t1_cvd9qnt,asimpleenigma,"Depends on how competitive the Republican nominee ends up being. If it's someone that has some moderate/independent appeal the GOP will have some very good talking points to win over swing voters.

Hillary's scandals are not the type that are easily ignored and will do damage to her reputation. All that shit will be amped to 11 and all over all media as the election draws near rather than lurking on Fox News, CNN, etc. The Democratic core will rally around her and she'll certainly have the money to punch back, but she's not the Democrat version of Reagan or anything.",6,0,1443145291,1444727714
cvda3mq,1,t3_3m9twp,asimpleenigma,"Hillary it's probably the odds-on favorite to win but she is far from unassailable. If she gets the nomination the Republicans will press the issue of the missing emails, Benghazi, and such relentlessly. Hillary will have to make it a top priority to appear more likable and trustworthy to the average voter. If the Republicans had a reasonably popular candidate with moderate appeal I would say they would have the clear advantage. Even given the uninspiring Republican candidates currently, they will just have to market the candidate as ""not Hillary"" to get plenty of support. Bernie Fucking Sanders could be the Republican nominee and I'd bet my paycheck most Republicans would check the Bernie Sanders box than vote for Hillary.",14,0,1443144709,1444727714
cvd9pgb,0,t1_cvd93is,asimpleenigma,A big part of Sanders' appeal is he generally lacks the smell of bullshit and shady dealing that Clinton oozes. ideologically most Democrats will be more in tune with Hillary's platform.,10,0,1443144046,1444727714
cvd9j4a,0,t1_cvd93xw,asimpleenigma,If she gets the Democrat nomination the Republican Party will hammer the email scandal so hard the entire country will know how to administer an email server by voting day.,12,0,1443143757,1444727714
cvczlzb,1,t3_3m74s9,asimpleenigma,"I'd like if they added a mode that was more roleplayish. Kinda like CK2 where it can be just as fun creating this wacky dynasty as it is to take over the world. I dream of more nuanced relations with other countries as well as more intricate domestic happiness. Allow a little more personality into the nations especially late game.

More specifically I'd love a game mode where it is just as fun to simply exist in the global politics as it is to try and win the game.",2,0,1443127225,1444727714
cvcxat7,0,t1_cvcwny8,asimpleenigma,"Oh god you keep bringing up bad memories! I had forgotten about squadron hawk. I played mostly when UW Control, RDW, Valakut, and one other deck I'm forgetting were king. Jace was a powerhouse staple then as well but not game breaking at that point. I loved my Frost Titan super tapout with Venser.",1,0,1443123832,1444727714
cvcw1mm,0,t1_cvcrrn5,asimpleenigma,I'm thinking I sold mine right before he got banned then. It was after Scars was fully released because I now remember hating those goddamn swords. I thought he was about to retire soon but maybe it wasn't until the next block several months out ,1,0,1443121996,1444727714
cvcvwlm,0,t1_cvcs6nt,asimpleenigma,"I now remember Stoneforge Mystic. Yeah I hated that combo. I played a frost titan deck but seeing those stupid swords...

I sold my two Jaces and I remember being worried at the time that their value was going to drop because he was about to rotate out. Maybe it was farther away than i thought as the Scars of Mirrodin block had just been fully released.",1,0,1443121785,1444727714
