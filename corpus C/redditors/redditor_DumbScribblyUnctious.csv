cvx0o7w,0,t1_cvwtp53,DumbScribblyUnctious,"You're trying to argue that it's absurd but that's exactly how life is. You have relative levels of risk surrounding you every day that you have to come to terms with.

We make the same negotiations concerning the risks involved with every other modern convenience in our lives. From Bath tubs to ladders to cars to electricity. We keep them around because the benefits outweigh the risks. And the risks are kept at a minimum only by people being responsible.

Far more children die each year from unintentional poisoning, drowning in bath tubs or swimming pools, or falling down stairs.
In those situations and the one where the child gets a hold of a firearm the fault rests with solely with the parents or other individual that was responsible for supervising the child. The responsibility does not rest upon the inanimate objects that were involved in the injury or death of the child. 

If you want to reduce your risks of fire you buy a fire extinguisher. If you want to reduce your risks of being killed in a car crash you can buy a safer car and drive more safely.
If you want to reduce your risk of being a victim of a crime you buy a crime extinguisher (firearm), you lock your doors, you report crimes, and if that all fails you move somewhere that has less crime.

In 2013, 3,154 people were killed as a result of distracted driving crashes. Over 400,000 people were injured in that same year from the same cause: people valuing communication over their personal safety while driving.

Where we differ on this issue is where to place the blame, who to punish, and how to correct the problem. I do not blame cell phones or the cars for those injuries or deaths, and you likely do not either. It was the poor choices of those drivers that caused those accidents.

Firearms are the same way.",1,0,1444665714,1444720893

I wanted to offer a rebuttal to the overly simplistic approach offered in this image.

Which offered no analysis and tried to prove its point only visually. But it also had plenty of factual errors in it in the first place.

After fact-checking it I converted the gun laws to numerical values so that I could provide each state with an objective score, since preliminary tests using the Brady score showed that I get markedly worse correlations. They seem to have very subjectively weighted specific categories of laws in ways I can't practically determine. It's pretty difficult to sort the states by Gun laws in a way that provides both objectivity and a good resolution on variation.

Both trend lines in the graph are covariate only. Since the relationship inferred by the image that I wanted to explore further basically decided the relationships for me.

No it hasn't. There's nothing unique going on here. Lots of states have seen similar statistically rare but overly-publiscized events of violence.
These two are from Arizona. Why the hell should anyone listen to their opinion on the policies or elections in Virginia?

>Since then, the Republicans’ ­veto-proof majority in the House of Delegates has blocked much of McAuliffe’s agenda, including Medicaid expansion, nonpartisan redistricting and stricter gun laws.

See. We, as voted on by our delegates, don't want your policies.

if you want to live in a state with popular support for gun control you can live on the other side of the Patomac in Maryland. They've had just as many ""mass-shootings"" as we have. But their overall homicide rate is double ours.
