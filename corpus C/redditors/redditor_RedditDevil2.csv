cvwsyqd,1,t3_3od91l,RedditDevil2,THE FATHER OF THE OCEANIC ABYSS IS REAL. OH MY GOD.,2,0,1444648338,1444723235
cvvhw5k,1,t3_3o9g38,RedditDevil2,"1. What is the Grey, The Center, and The Debt to be paid?

2. I know you said you don't want to spoon-feed us, but how are we to stop the imminent dangers such as Souls in the Stone, father in the oceanic abyss, and Andromeda? I'm sure you understand that if humans were to try and stop this as one individual person they would be labelled as insane, crazy, and could quite possibly be thrown into jail if they got too extreme about it. I don't want humanity to die, because as horrible as it can be, not all humans are as bad as the rest. As childish as it may sound, it's how I feel.

3. Somewhere in the comment thread I read something about phsycic energy. I'm not asking if we have it, because I know we do. I'm asking what the human mind is capable of. How far can we push our minds? What....abilities?? can we use? I hope you understand what I'm asking. I don't know how to word it very well.

4. Do you count as what we call an alien? Do others like you exist?

5. What is The Father in the Ocean? Can you offer a little more detail about it?

6. Did gods exist at one point in time, as another race which ruled over humanity as a whole?(Bit of a random question there, but I'm asking as I see fit.)

7. How do we push ourselves to start gaining the ability to use the psychic energy? (referring to my above question.)

I by the way, about the music thing I didn't mean just for that subject. I more or less meant about anything. But, even though it hasn't been that long since I posted it I've actually been getting better at talking. But thanks for the input, I highly appreciate it and I will try to take it easy. I already take nice walks, I walk every day, and have been participating more in after school activities to help me get some exercise. The only reason I really gained that weight was because of a lot of sitting, and eating mostly only junk food. But because of school I hardly do either. I've actually slowly been losing weight. Before I posted that I was around 235 pounds.  But seriously, thanks for the input.",2,0,1444253991,1444723235

This is a reference to an old story about a man.
If you answer my question about this, there may actually be a possibility of escape if you could figure it out.
Is there a place in your world called Taurus? ",2,0,1443374729,1444723235
