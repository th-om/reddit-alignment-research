cvwwnum,1,t3_3ofy50,jack_wagon_supreme,It's really hilarious to see the darling candidate of the left poll so low with minority voters. Any republican with similar numbers would be ridiculed. ,-3,0,1444658686,1444731906

Food Insecurity
Low food security (old label=Food insecurity without hunger): reports of reduced quality, variety, or desirability of diet. Little or no indication of reduced food intake.
Very low food security (old label=Food insecurity with hunger): Reports of multiple indications of disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake.

This definition seems broad and vague to the point it means nothing. What is the breakdown of low and very low food security children in the stated statistics?",-1,0,1444377544,1444731906

cvfwwvy,0,t1_cvfed80,jack_wagon_supreme,"In my eyes the digging for illegal action is largely an attempt by Clinton's opponents to kill her presidential bid. Nothing appears to be illegal, but that won't stop the Republicans from digging. Can you really blame them though? If this were the email server of Dick Cheney, Mitt Romney, John Bohner, etc would you not expect the Democrats to comb through it for dirt?

As a voter I don't care if Clinton's actions were technically legal or not. I don't believe this was anything other than a deliberate effort to control what would see the light of day. Nothing on her server may have been classified at the time. However, she knew full well her communication would be HIGHLY sensitive chose to use a server in her home instead of government email. Was she more worried about national security or her political career?",1,0,1443373228,1444731906
cutlqy1,1,t3_3jywwr,jack_wagon_supreme,"It is obvious Hillary was planning to run for president in 2016. To me the most simple explanation is that Clinton and her team went to this trouble to be able to control what would eventually become public. The actions are very consistent with this theory. By the Clinton camp's own admission over 30,000 emails were excluded from the content turned over and the server was then erased. Nod to doubt most of those were innocuous personal emails. However, I think it's completely likely there were some messages to Bill, friends, donors, and advisors that Clinton would not want seeing the light of day considering she has ambitions to become president. In fact, you don't have to believe such messages exist. You merely have to believe that in early 2009 Clinton and team thought such messages might exist and were worth the trouble of containing. I don't think that is a stretch.",29,0,1441646918,1444731906
cutimj7,1,t3_3jyn5q,jack_wagon_supreme,"The sandwich, salad, and slow cooker suggestions in this thread are all great. To me bringing my lunch goes hand in hand with cooking dinner regularly. Work on building a collection of recipes you enjoy eating and do not take long to prepare. Get in the habit of planning out your meals for the entire week and making a single grocery trip to stock up. As other have mentioned, make your dinners large enough to always have leftovers for a lunch or two. 

A few years ago I bought a vacuum sealer and it has been fantastic. Certain dishes can be sealed, frozen, and thawed with great results. Lasagne and ziti are obvious choices. I have tried this with other pasta dishes and gotten good results. Most stir fry dishes also freeze well. Throw a little rice in with the stir fry, so it is ready to go. 

For dishes that freeze I well I simply make a double or quadruple batch every so often to stock up the freezer. Most of the time it is not much extra work to make larger batches. That second pan of lasagne is probably only and extra 10 minutes of work and will give you at least 8 lunches. I keep a few bags of frozen vegetables around to throw in with these meals.

cuq45f4,0,t1_cupvvdv,jack_wagon_supreme,"From what I have read Colin Powell used a yahoo account. Your link says it was occasionally used for official business. This is a far cry from setting up a private server, storing it at home, and then erasing the hard drive. I don't even care about the possibility of Clinton having sent classified material via her private server. Her actions clearly show she had the intention to control this data to prevent it from hurting her political career. ",28,0,1441341057,1444731906

cupspos,0,t1_cupbq55,jack_wagon_supreme,"Trump certainly had a tremendous head start in life. However, these comparisons are meaningless. We are talking about his current personal net worth and comparing it to the theoretical growth of an amount of money he didn't have 40 years ago. The total value of the company he ran is similarly irrelevant. If the numbers being mentioned are at all accurate, even Donald's father didn't own all of the business. It's not like Donald had $300 million in seed money and kept all of the winnings for himself. I don't doubt he was given a great start and a pile of money to begin with, but this line of attack is absurd.

Trump has lived lavishly, grown his business, and established a brand pretty much all Americans are aware of over the past 40 years. This author claims Trump would have been just as well off if he instead liquidated the business, somehow claimed his inheritance 25 years early, and lived in obscurity (off of some other source of income apparently). Wut? Remember, he isn't touching those millions and billions over the years because he has to reinvest all gains. No more buildings with his name on them in Manhattan. No more Trump golf courses, casinos, seminars, etc. No TV shows. No babes. No penthouse living. No forcing your way into being a serious presidential contender. Certainly these things have tremendous value to a person like Trump. Any half-serious attempt at this math would at the very least made some attempt to account for the cost of the good life instead of compounding those dividends.

Not only is this very much flawed logic to use to attack Trump's business skills, but the author also assumes Trump's record is bad without any context. Let's just assume that this comparison is valid and Trump has simply matched the growth of the stock market over the last 40 years. Is that bad for the business he is in? I have no idea and this article certainly doesn't explore these issues at all. ",9,0,1441320275,1444731906
cupbdf8,1,t3_3jhpo7,jack_wagon_supreme,"I haven't done any of my own research into this, but according to comments I read that in another thread this article is extremely disingenuous. The $40,000,000 is based on Donald's fifth of his father's net worth at the time Donald began his career. The trouble is the father didn't die until 1999, 25 years later. Who knows what he actually had to start with back in the 70s. 

Also, this article begs the question of what happened to the other four siblings who saw the same privilege and experience as Donald. Surely they must all be billionaires.",27,0,1441293386,1444731906
