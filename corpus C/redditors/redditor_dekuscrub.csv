If the term ""patent troll"" encompasses entities which actively do research and license the results of that research, then it seems a stretch to claim that all such trolls are simply rent seeking.

cvu4teb,0,t1_cvu3ulm,dekuscrub,">Well you keep insisting the $29 billion number is some heinous lie when the sum total of patent litigation is $83 billion. So yeah, I'm going to point out that if I wanted to be as broad as you are accusing me of I've got a bigger number to go with.

The number represents an over estimation of a concept that is broader than you claimed. The fact that you could use a *worse* figure doesn't matter. One can almost always discover a way to be more wrong. 

>Patents which are paid by taxpayer money and frequently sold to patent trolls? Yes they are patent trolls and are enabling patent trolls.

I'm asking whether or not the universities themselves are trolls, in your view. It's a simple question. If all entities that hold patents without using them in a product are patent trolls, which seems to be the position you support, then it follows that quite a few universities are trolls. If universities aren't patent trolls, then it looks like the given definition isn't super useful. 

>Please, by all means provide evidence they aren't selling patents to patent trolls?

I have not implied that they don't. I'm trying to see whether or not you think a university that generates and retains a patent is a patent troll. ",1,0,1444424126,1444717736
cvu311z,0,t1_cvu2mh6,dekuscrub,">Well, Cato says patent litigation costs $83 billion a year. Would you prefer I use their numbers?

So now we've gone from all NPE suits, broader than patent trolls, to all patent litigation, which is broader still. So it's strictly less applicable to the point you were trying to make. 

>I'm uncertain why the government should have a monopoly on a given patent in the first place that was funded by tax payer money?

I'm referring to universities that hold patent portfolios, whether or not government funding was a factor. Universities,  generally but not always with federal funding, do R&D and patent the result. They then collect royalties, to the tune of a few billion USD per year as I recall. Are they patent trolls, since they aren't using the patent to produce a product?  ",1,0,1444421356,1444717736
