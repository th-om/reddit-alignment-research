cvuvbrm,1,t3_3o7n17,greiton,"This thread is full of people advocating their pet subject like it is the only important subject. The truth is an intro to coding course will not turn kids into programmers.  It will teach them basics on how computers work, and give very valuable problem solving skills. Engineers all take a coding course not to learn to code our devices (someone with more than 1 sem should do this)  but to learn the way programmers methodically build solutions.  The way you can approach an issue in parts and produce something that can be iterated on.  ",4,0,1444493810,1444729210
