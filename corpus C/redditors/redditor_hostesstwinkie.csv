It could be argued that if you use less-lethal rounds, you didn't believe your life was in danger, and shouldn't have been shooting in the first place.

cvss7ah,0,t1_cvrmw3f,hostesstwinkie,"""Generational backups"" basically means that you make a backup every time there are any significant changes to the project, and you keep all of those backups.  That way, of for some reason there is corruption or accidental destruction in some part of the project and you don't notice it for days or weeks (like accidentally deleting 2 pages you don't notice until your are proofing it a month later), you can go ""back in time"" and pull the corrupt parts from the older backups.

For this kind of thing, dropbox or copy.com or something like that should work well, as I think they keep generational backups automatically.  If you are a little geeky, set up a private git or svn server at home or in the cloud and store your projects there. (that is what I do)",2,0,1444329912,1444727540

As a paying student, I'd be seriously pissed off and would consider reporting this incident the dean.  Start kicking the disrupting students out and keep kicking them out until the hall calms down.  I promise it won't take long.  Then make it clear to the remaining students what is expected.  If the prof isn't able to do this, they shouldn't be lecturing.  When I was in uni, my first freshman lecture was a mess until the prof walked in and flat out took control.  We had no more problems that semester.",1,0,1443226270,1444727540
