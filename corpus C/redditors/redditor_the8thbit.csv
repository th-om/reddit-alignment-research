Her vote for Bernie is in question and most likely she will vote for someone that isn't even on the radar. So I may have spoke wrongly in my previous post about my mom voting bern. I must ask the reddit community for forgiveness.

Have you shown her Bernie's speech at Liberty University? ",13,0,1443212082,1444727390

cvccaq8,0,t1_cvc77v5,the8thbit,"> They weren't true socialists as they didn't check A.1, Y.6, and Z.99""

There's only really one box to be checked, autonomous worker control of production. The state plays a very large role in production in Venezuela, so Venezuela isn't socialist. This is in contrast to actual socialist production, such as among the recovered factories in Argentina, CNT/FAI Spain, or the Zapatistas.

That being said, socialism isn't fool proof. A socialist business with dysfunctional employees can fail, just like a capitalist business with dysfunctional board members can fail. And socialism is also only a means of production, it doesn't dictate what system of exchange you use, or the super-structure that businesses and communities coalesce into, both of which can impact how successful an economic system is.

cvb1aql,0,t1_cvaje87,the8thbit,"When many people think of capitalism, they picture a purely economic system of markets reacting freely to demand. They view any sort of government involvement as a distortion of this system, for better or for worse. However, that couldn't be further from the truth: Capitalism is neither an economic nor political system, it's a mode of production, an interplay between the two. Capitalism depends on markets to function, but it also depends on state-sponsored welfare in order to function. Not piddly little things like billions of dollars in subsidies and tax loopholes, but the pervasive and fundamental police force, which exerts the will of capitalists on tax payer dime. Because the police enforce the capitalists' claim to productive assets, the supply of productive assets is centralized into the hands of capitalists, which allows capitalists to hire workers at a pay rate that is a fraction of the value they produce.",1,0,1442982084,1444727390
