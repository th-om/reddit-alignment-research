cvs0t6z,0,t1_cvs00sk,heycoworker,"The thing is Putin is operating according to a different understanding of geopolitics than the United States and the EU. He is the leader of Russia and Russian leaders have pretty much always taken a realist view of geopolitics. Security is a huge, overwhelming concern of Russian politics and it pretty much always has been. The Russians have warned against NATO and EU expansion literally since the fall of the USSR. It should not have been surprising that Putin would take issue with attempts to incorporate a nation that has such close historical ties to Russia and is of massive strategic importance to Russian security. Putin acted because he felt his hand was forced. Its the same story in Syria. Syria has been an important ally of Russia for a long time and is the site of Russia's Mediterranean naval base (something that has been of strategic importance to Russian leaders for literal centuries). Stabilizing Syria is important to Russia's strategic interests and NATO is very well aware of that. The West failed to implement a solution to the civil war so now Putin has decided to do it himself.   ",3,0,1444268972,1444718270
cvrzmie,1,t3_3nwp41,heycoworker,"Putin is taking a significant risk by getting involved in Syria but he is also a very skilled geopolitical strategist. Getting involved in Syria wasn't something that the Russians did on a whim, they know exactly what they are doing. Putin is well aware that starting an armed conflict with NATO would be the end of him. Russia is a declining power with an aging population and a large but mostly outdated military, they would stand no chance against a committed NATO coalition.

As far the the US and NATO are concerned, starting a war with Russia is just not worth it. Russia is still an important source of oil and natural gas for Western Europe and a war would threaten that. Additionally while Russia does not have the capabilities to seriously compete with NATO and would certainly lose the war it is still a formidable foe and not to mention a Nuclear power, it is still very capable of inflicting significant damage. Neither side has anything to gain from starting a war at all, if it ever looked like it were going to happen they would be at the negotiating table immediately. ",1,0,1444266922,1444718270
cvrke0s,1,t3_3nv67t,heycoworker,"as a moderate fiscal conservative, i believe unions are a crucial element of a free market system. They can provide important protections for workers who cannot protect themselves from employer abuse individually. That said, there has to be a balance. When the employer has undue power over their workers its not a positive thing but neither is it when the unions have undue influence over the employer. Im against mandatory membership and support right to work initiatives because forcing people to participate in a system they don't support is a violation of their rights. 

I think most republicans probably hold some variation on that view. Personally my biggest problem is with public unions. I think public unions can be and have been in certain places a serious detriment to reform. The point of a union is to give an employee the ability to petition their employer for better working conditions, however public employees already have that ability via their right to vote. Public unions are really a distortion of the democratic process. Unfortunately they are a deeply entrenched institution thats probably not going anywhere.  ",23,0,1444243161,1444718270
cvr9fh7,0,t1_cvr8ndv,heycoworker,"first of all drug use does not necessitate addiction. The modern medical understanding of addiction views it as a mental disorder. people can be more inclined or less inclined to become addicted to a wide wide variety of things. most people are not prone to forming long-term addictions. it has been long understood that incarcerating people who are actual addicts is a really poor way of dealing with what is in reality a medical issue that should be handled by medical professionals. In any case these people are not being released into 'a neighborhood', they're being released into supervisory care until they have recovered or are otherwise deemed competent to re-assimilate into society.

cvp8e7x,0,t1_cvp7hox,heycoworker,"Clothing is absolutely cheaper because of free trade. Textiles are not a bad example because some people lost their jobs. Foreign countries produce textiles cheaper and in greater quantites than they could be produced in the United States. Therefore other countries have a comparative advantage in textiles. As a result the factors of production devoted to textile production in the united state are redirected into markets in which the United States has a comparative advantage. Now textiles and, for a real world example, lets say airplanes are being produced as efficiently as possible so the prices for textile and airplanes are as low as possible, this is specialization. Some people lost jobs in the textile industry, more got jobs in the aviation industry but on the whole, in aggregate the entire economy benefits. I am not qualified to empirically demonstrate this phenomenon and even if i were i wouldnt take the time to do so on reddit. I provided you with sources that do empirically show that effect and you're welcome to read them. The academic consensus on this matter is overwhelming. ",2,0,1444073063,1444718270

Referring to the experts is not grounds for criticism. The evidence is abundant and also complex. if you want specific examples the most obvious is the garment industry.   
edit: also prices will go down as a consequence of  tariff reduction anyway. its literally the entire point of these agreements. ",3,0,1444070574,1444718270

Comparative advantage and specialization are some of the very very few things on which economists almost universally agree.

I'm going to preempt you demanding sources and offer up *The Controversy over Free Trade: The Gap between Economists and the General Public* by Cletus C. Coughlin and *The Political Economy of Trading States* by Alt and Gilligan. Also take a gander at Hillary Clinton's article, *America's Pacific Century* for an argument specific to the TPP.
