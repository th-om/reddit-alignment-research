cv9yz4d,0,t1_cv988fb,Homestaff17,"Well, it's pretty much in the title. Any one who's worked in the City as long as she has knows what the atmosphere is like. It's a man's world, but I'm not saying women can't excel. There's a trader who sits next to me who is the best market operator I have ever seen, she shrugs off all the 'sexist' bollocks flying around the office and gets on with it. She has massive respect from every single person here. 

Also the four women hired for entertainment were strippers at the actual club, not workers for the bank. 

Also I would love to see what these texts actually looked like. 

It's all been blown out of proportion. I think she knew she wasn't performing well at the time, thus is now looking for a tasty pay off. Why, if she's been working in the City for years, would she look to take action only now?! ",1,0,1442906468,1444727904

cv8upjk,0,t1_cv63wlp,Homestaff17,Well there was nothing in there about a specific insult being directed at her. If she said 'on one occasion I was asked to wear a more revealing top etc' then I totally understand. Expressing a general attitude doesn't mean a thing. ,1,0,1442827390,1444727904
cv5ybue,0,t1_cv5xpt3,Homestaff17,Doesn't imply exact abuse towards her though. Just an attitude. 'women generally'. ,1,0,1442591195,1444727904
