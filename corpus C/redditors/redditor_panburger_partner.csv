It shows the process very clearly, and comes out great!  I've made it 5 or 6 times this way.  A little time consuming but so worth it.

""(The)clinic is solely devoted to Planned Parenthood's other services (birth control, STD screening etc). If someone wants an abortion, she gets referred to one of the two facilities in the State that provide abortion services. Those buildings use a separate water and electrical grid specifically for abortions. Abortions are only performed on certain days so that the cost of the facilities and salaries on those days is paid for with private dollars.""

That being said, I do respect the fact that you're willing to discuss this important issue in a logical way.  Seems rare these days!
