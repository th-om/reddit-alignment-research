If eternal health is guaranteed along with immortality (and really why shouldn't it be?), then I would say yes, as long as I get to pick and choose who comes and goes. Because I really don't want to live forever with people who think pot should be schedule 1, or people who steal, or people who put a big ass exhaust on their car to make it super loud and then drive by my apartment, or people who sue for stupid shit. 

My list is complicated, but I'm sure I could rack up 2.5 billion.",1,0,1444693320,1444717862

I mean, hell and yes. You realize how much a person could accomplish with infinite time?

Most stupid people don't read, so I think this is wrong. In fact, I've read guidebooks that suggest quite the opposite. Don't write down to people, just as you wouldn't talk down to them. 

There's a difference between dumping and conveniently placing. Dialogue, interactions, those reveal a lot about relationships, more than a paragraph of text will. ",1,0,1444684147,1444717862
cvxd7ar,1,t3_3ohrri,steelerfaninperu,"I'm siding with some others in thinking that you're probably over-explaining in some instances. Magic could be explained in a couple of sentences. A new planet, while interesting and worth some exposition, is not really that different from someone describing a city that you or I have never been to, or another person's home. You could say a thousand words or a hundred.

If you're describing things all day, you're taking away the reader's autonomy. Give a few key details that are relevant to what is happening at the moment, and as you do this over time people will piece together the scene. Let people fill in the blanks with their imagination. If you tell them everything, it gives them no freedom to create the scene in their minds.",4,0,1444683987,1444717862

His criteria (and I'm paraphrasing) were along the lines of having lots of downtime, ala Maytag Repairman, or security guard, so you could get paid while you write. Set schedules are a plus, as a writing routine is beneficial. He also pointed out that school teacher is probably the worst option, and that's what I do. ",1,0,1444683567,1444717862
