cvsseip,0,t1_cvs0m25,Silacker,"I was once in a vehicle that had a 6 pack of beer in a paper bag in the back seat, next to where I was sitting.  The driver was drunk (I didn't know when they picked me up), and ended up getting pulled over and issued a DUI.  The officer asked me to breathalyze, and I refused to because I didn't think he had the right to make me.  He told me it was either breathalyze or he was going to take me to jail for the night and charge me with an MIP.  I took the later option and had it dropped in pre-trial to a civil infraction. 

Anyways, am I wrong in thinking he couldn't charge me with that, but that he did anyways?  And that I had to experience real consequences (night in jail and fines) from that, regardless of the law, because of the power the position provided him?

Idk if something should be automatically considered ""alternative medicine"" if it's not the first or second line treatment. I mean... it is an alternative treatment... but if it's truly more efficacious than other treatments, it should eventually replace the other treatments.  Assuming the use of evidence-based medicine.",2,0,1441760654,1444731024
