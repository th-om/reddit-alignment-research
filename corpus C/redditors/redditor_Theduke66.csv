Wages would be slashed and would then create a market for even lower prices goods to accommodate those needs.  Thankfully though there would be a boom to produce all of those goods in America, but they would be paying wages that would be low as possible.  This then would continue to happen until we ""normalized"" the wages much lower than there are currently.  Some expenditures that people have that would not be as affected by the drop would hurt us the most, namely real estate.  Without even talking about all those who would already in leases/mortgages that would be affected by the wage shift downwards.  The real estate does not follow closely the [current wage increases](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-26/u-s-home-prices-are-surging-13-times-faster-than-wages) now and i don't see any reason why they would in the future.  Yes they would have to adjust at some level, but they will always charge the absolute most that they can get.

This of course would also not happen in a vacuum and other countries would still be paying the same rates.  So,  I think that Canada would be seeing a influx of residents.

Edit :  wages would decrease overall because of the globalization of our economy.  We don't compete in manufacturing things with the lowest total costs just within our own country we do that around the world.
