cvxq6bx,0,t1_cvxnzm5,itstriche,"While you're not entirely wrong, I will note that some of the most frivolous spending resulting in our ""ballooning defecit"" has been at the behest of the men who popularized the term ""Laffer Curve"";

>A hypothetical Laffer curve for any given economy can only be estimated and such estimates are *controversial*. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics reports that estimates of revenue-maximizing tax rates have varied widely, with a mid-range of around 70%.[2]

>Although economist Arthur Laffer does not claim to have invented the Laffer curve concept,[3] **it was popularized in the west with policymakers following an afternoon meeting with Ford Administration officials Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld** in 1974 in which he reportedly sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate his argument.[4]

Does it shock you that some of the men benefitting from this extremely basic and flawed economic view are large champions of keeping their taxable income level right where it is? Or does it take more millionaires and billionaires telling the government that they should be, and [WANT TO BE](http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/16/news/economy/tax_millionaires/) taxed more for you to understand this isn't just a spending issue. 

And thats wholly ignoring that its based on an extremely narrow and nearly irrelevant view of economics

>The Laffer curve as presented is also simplistic in that it assumes a single tax rate and a single labor supply. Actual systems of public finance are more complex. There is serious doubt about the relevance of considering a single marginal tax rate.[2] In addition, revenue may well be a multivalued function of tax rate; for instance, an increase in tax rate to a certain percentage may not result in the same revenue as a decrease in tax rate to the same percentage (a kind of hysteresis). Furthermore, the Laffer curve does not take explicitly into account the nature of the tax avoidance taking place.

thats all directly from the page you linked. This Reaganomics thing needs to be put to rest. You do not stimulate growth with supply side economics. You need DEMAND.",1,1,1444704338,1444731212

Unfortunately, the former Russian scientist who was being handled by the CIA was able to figure out what was changed in the blueprints from a cursory glance, but because of pressure from top officials, the plan went ahead and gave Iran the blueprints, possibly pushing their nuclear program 20+ years ahead of where it should be considering they have plenty of Russian scientists like the one we employed who was able to identify the problem nearly immediately.

And while HE may not have been wholly correct assuming the specific numbers, i do believe you plainly saying ""$772 for obstruction"" is wrong as well. This very well may be the cost of the ticket, court fees, as well as any additional penalty for failure to pay on time initially/removal of the warrant for arrest. Without being there and knowing all the details, neither of us can know for sure, but having received a speeding ticket in the past and noticed how many additional fees they stack on top, it is not unlikely IMO. 

Side note: i apologize for being a snarky douche, as well. Two wrongs don't make a right and as much as i love to be clever, I still feel guilty being a dick. have a good one!",2,0,1443134017,1444731212

I included ""naked"" in my summary of the events because they do appear to be a consequence of his arrest, and subsequent (forced)detox from his rehabilitation regimen. The video stated it was for his own safety, however his family went un-notified and the EMTs were not called, even when his condition worsened. He died naked and alone on a cell floor for what amounts to failure to pay a ticket (and i realize that is a tad reductionist since it was his failure to pay that resulted in the warrant for arrest, but the original impetus remains the same). This should really be another signal as to why we absolutely need a formal investigation on the treatment of the incarcerated mentally-ill, nationwide. However, I do concede that my original statement may appear unclear as to whether I thought he was improperly stripped down or not. For clarity, I do believe they were following the proper procedure putting him in a mental health cell, but far more should have been done to follow up, which is where the negligence arises.

cvczz42,0,t1_cvcydtt,itstriche,"Not to discredit the doc, but imagine being so addicted to something you would steal from your family to fund your habit, then voluntarily (or non-voluntarily) decide to get clean, but first you must walk through the hell that is withdrawal. Perhaps ""bad flu"" is an apt description, never been addicted to heroin so I can't attest, but pretty much anyone I have ever known to get clean says it is the hardest path you ever have to walk. Not only are you in constant pain, but you know that just one hit will make it all go away. So ontop of the horrific pain, you are now battling the demons in your own head telling you to relapse. Imagine having the worst flu symptoms  possible (burning/freezing skin, feels like your bones are made of fire and glass at the same time, constant nausea/vomitting) with no idea when this pain was going to stop, and then imagine that you knew there was something that could make it all go away, except if you ever stop again, the flu comes back worse than ever. Maybe Trainspotting and Requiem For a Dream are just movies, but I have heard them hailed as some of the most accurate depictions of heroin abuse available. Former addict testimony and those fine films have me fairly convinced that the horrors of heroin withdrawal may be one of the only things the D.A.R.E. program was actually right about.

cvczgu8,0,t1_cvcrwnf,itstriche,"The ""obstruction of justice"" charge is because he didn't pay the ticket within the period of time required, thus resulting in a warrant being issued for his arrest. He was then arrested and issued to 30-days in jail for being unable to pay the $772. This still strikes me as putting a man in prison for being unable to pay his ticket. 

Him being imprisoned isn't even the most outrageous thing about this, IMO. Over the 17 days he did survive in this jail, he lost almost 50lbs due to severe benzodiazepine withdrawal (that he was prescribed and using to get clean from illegal drugs), and his family was not even notified about his rapid health deterioration. I might ask myself, ""Who is really guilty of obstructing justice here; The guy who was thrown in jail naked without his necessary medication, or the cops who left him to die in a jail cell over $772?""

 But hey, who needs to be informed to make comments anyway. Its not like I found all that out by actually watching the whole video. Or did you turn it off as soon as you found what you wanted to cherry pick from it? 

 (i was tempted to not be sarcastic at all in this rebuttal, but your false hubris was too ironic to pass up, maybe be less of a dick next time. After all, does it being ""obstruction of justice"" instead of just being an inflated ticket somehow justify debtors prison? This seems like one of those red flag situations that our criminal justice system is a bit fucked up. A man did die here, after all. )",94,0,1443127015,1444731212
