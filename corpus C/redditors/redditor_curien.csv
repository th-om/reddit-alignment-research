The fact is that the *average* Marine makes E-3 in the exact same amount of time as the average Airman. The average Airman makes E-4 two months faster than the average Marine, and then the Airman takes longer for every subsequent rank.

Suppose humans exist on three planets. The humans on planets A and B can reproduce, and the humans on B and C can reproduce; but the humans on A and C cannot.

The problem is that ""are the same species"" is necessarily transitive (if A and B are the same species, and B and C are, then A and C must be). But ability to reproduce together is not. There are analogs of this situation among populations of animals on Earth.",49,0,1444425615,1444726288

However E-4 is not an automatic promotion in the Marines, whereas it is in the AF (and other branches). That could make the Marines faster or slower depending on the person.

I did not have a BC until well into adulthood (it was lost when I was a child), and I had no problem obtaining DLs in two different states or several bank accounts (yes, post-9/11). The only time I've had to present a BC in order to obtain a DL was in Texas.
