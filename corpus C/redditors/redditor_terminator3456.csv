Redditors also degenerated into their worst teenage sex jokes & questions - I was incredibly disappointed with the whole thing.

While I wouldn't call it a ""hiccup"" cheating is pretty run of the mill.

Cheating + other guy being your best friend + best friend kills himself in your bathtub (!) + stay with gf who cheated on you with your best friend who killed himself in your bathtub (!) = OP will never ever be able to fully get over any of this unless he clears his life of her.",-2,0,1444671615,1444721768
