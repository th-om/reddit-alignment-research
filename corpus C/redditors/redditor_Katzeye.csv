The '66 refers to him being born during the first Super Bowl in 1966 where the Buffalo Bills lost. The mother talks about how she missed the game because she was giving birth to him, and she considers that to have been a jinx on the game. At one point she actually says ""I wish you were never born"" implying that Buffalo would have won if it weren't for him.
