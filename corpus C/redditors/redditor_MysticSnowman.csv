As such they also lie.

You may disagree with their view, but that doesn't directly mean they are liars. In all issues there are pros and cons, some people think one way, others may think another way.

> Jobs are not taken. Yes. But they compress wages.

Overall, [wages are not compressed](http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/ea019.pdf). The impact on lower-income wages is minimal. *There is still no evidence of an overall negative impact of immigration on jobs, wages,
housing or the crowding out of public services. Any negative impacts on wages of less
skilled groups are small.*

> And immigration goes grow the economy in the sense that GDP goes up. But per capita goes down. Unless the migrants are highly skilled, ie more productive than the average Brit.

GDP per capita may go down, but that's because low-skilled immigrants generally have lower incomes than native UK residents, not because they lower their wages.

cvqb522,1,t3_3nqdva,MysticSnowman,"THIRTEEN years ago the Conservatives’ first female chairman stood at the lectern at the annual party conference and declared that the Tories needed to shake off their “nasty party” image. “I want us to be the party that represents the whole of Britain and not merely some mythical place called ‘Middle England’,” she said, “but the truth is that as our country has become more diverse, our party has remained the same.”

How Theresa May has changed. While the chancellor, George Osborne, attempts to shift his party to the centre, openly courting Labour voters in his conference speech this week, the home secretary’s address was aimed at the party’s right, and those mythical middle-Englanders. She used the speech to announce a new drive to curb immigration to Britain, and with it was a much harsher tone. “[W]hen immigration is too high, when the pace of change is too fast,” she said, “it’s impossible to build a cohesive society.” The nasty party, said Tory detractors (for the phrase has stuck), is back.

The home secretary’s new policies concentrate on limiting the right to claim asylum. The government will invoke new rules which mean it can treat any asylum claim by a citizen of another European Union country as automatically inadmissible. It will also change the welfare system to stop migrants on very low salaries being able to claim the same levels of benefits as they do now. Furthermore, there will be efforts to reduce overstayers on student visas.

All of which suggests that in the race to succeed David Cameron, who has indicated that he will step down as prime minister before the next election in 2020, the home secretary is positioning herself as the right-wing alternative to Mr Osborne and Boris Johnson, the mayor of London. These two, the current front-runners, are more relaxed about immigration and generally socially liberal.

Ms May’s speech will cause her problems. First, the home secretary cannot stir up concerns about immigration without attacking her own record. “There is no case, in the national interest, for immigration of the scale we have experienced,” she said. Yet it is during her five years as home secretary that immigration from within the EU has more than doubled. Net migration to Britain is at its highest-ever level.

Second, many of her assertions are based on shaky evidence. She states, for example, that immigration forces people out of work—a claim that is directly contradicted by a report published by her own department last year, which concluded that there was little evidence “that migration has caused statistically significant displacement of UK natives from the labour market in periods when the economy is strong”.
