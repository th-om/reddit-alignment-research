cvvzl2h,0,t1_cvvxqxn,thatsumoguy07,Temp control is really were ecigs needed to go. But we do need to find a way to move past non-resistance wires mainly because of their effects from being dry burnt and oxidation. The thing that will make ecigs as safe as it can be is temp control with kanthal which we are not that far off from seeing happen.,1,0,1444585668,1444731268

Basically it takes the act of vaporizing a juice and turns it into combustion, but that is only at very high temps and very burnt cotton, the average vaper will probably never come close to.",3,0,1444580085,1444731268
cvqig30,0,t1_cvqg9za,thatsumoguy07,"Wow, that was ridiculous. Why would they even spend money on that? Doesn't Office hold a 90% some percent stranglehold on document creation software (outside of the obvious Adobe monopoly)? Why go and throw dirt against a competitor who is of no real harm to you?",3,0,1444163948,1444731268
cvq00y8,0,t1_cvpzmjo,thatsumoguy07,"Actually the sandbox is bigger now than before, allowing for more core level application interfacing, but they supplemented this with obscuring their code to the point that trying to find anything worthwhile takes longer than before. But still you can barely do anything inside of iOS's sandbox without profile installation, and even then core level code is still hidden beyond the sandbox.",1,0,1444134314,1444731268
cvpzint,0,t1_cvpzeq0,thatsumoguy07,"It is a totally different thing. I personally believe if this was a real thing someone in the jailbreak community would have found it and exploited it for a super easy jailbreak (like jailbreak.me and the pdf exploit). It just doesn't seem that feasible as an exploit though because of how locked down the sandbox was on iOS. The bug that caused the crash and killed the messages app was a text handling error that can cause a crash inside of the sandbox that can crash the whole system, but still didn't leave the sandbox.",41,0,1444132879,1444731268
cvpu3td,0,t1_cvptz2e,thatsumoguy07,"Yeah I didn't realize the year and didn't check what version she was running, which I guess 2007 does make it more reasonable for a disc needed for DSL purposes, but still, a simple call to your ISP and you'll be set.",1,0,1444111472,1444731268
cvpkv9s,0,t1_cvpkep2,thatsumoguy07,"Open Office is extremely janky, I am not one to pull punches on that, but it's not like it can't work. I am a MS Office guy personal, I just like the feel and look of it, can't really explain it, but that being said Open Office and the better alternative (IMO) LibreOffice are not too shabby and can work, even if it is wonky.

I guess it could have been DSL (and it was Verizon in 2009), but she should have just tried calling, it doesn't take computer smarts to know to call the ISP for questions about your connections.",1,0,1444093314,1444731268
cvphhnx,0,t1_cvpg07l,thatsumoguy07,"Open Office can open, edit, and save .doc files. It can open and convert the newer .docx files to .doc. She literally could do everything she wanted on that machine, and she didn't need the CD for her internet connection (and who does, this is 2015 not 1995)",31,0,1444087394,1444731268
cvmvqj9,0,t1_cvmqvd9,thatsumoguy07,"This is exactly it. They fear Catholics and Islam more than they do atheists, mainly because Islam is just an extreme form of what they believe (in some regards) and Catholics are a more lax form. All it takes is a kid figuring out that they are being taught the same principles and jumping ship and they lose their iron grip on society. I could lose a tons of friends on Facebook by showing that Islam recognizes Jesus and that the story of Armageddon is pretty same similar between Islam and Christianity. ",5,0,1443892040,1444731268

I can't find the link I was looking at before, but they come in plastic boxes, some don't, that have a large display with a single board, so I thought maybe this kid bought one and put it together, but I guess I was wrong.",1,0,1443743738,1444731268
