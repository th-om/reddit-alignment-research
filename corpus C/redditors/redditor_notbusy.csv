I get what you're saying, but it's not the same. In a legal, above board strip club, there is no sex. If you are purchasing porn or viewing it on the Internet, there is no sex.

> Some videos a guy throws money at a girl and she takes it, they have sex. That is on video, which looks like prostitution to me.

LOL! OK, for the guy on camera, sure, it looks like prostitution. Heck, I've often wondered why johns just don't video their experience. Then it's porn, not prostitution, right? Yeah, you've got a valid point there. There is a glaring difference between the treatment of prostitution and a guy holding a camera while he has sex with a woman he's paying money to for having sex. In a way, that almost proves how ridiculous it is trying to criminalize behavior between consenting adults.",1,0,1444625658,1444718568

I'm definitely for holding people accountable for their economic externalities they cause on others. But they have to be real, not imagined or implied.

> Or the case where initial capital outlays make the project unfeasible on an individual scale but on a societal or macro scale is possible.

People have learned how to pool resources and technology makes that even easier. Sometimes a large group of people get together and sell shares of their operation in order to raise capital for large projects.

> And problems with free riders.

I'm not sure if free riders are always a problem. If a neighborhoods decides to raise funds for an art project, for instance, and then installs it outdoors, is it really a problem that some out of town folks might see it for free? I suppose you could put a fence around it and charge admission. Or the neighborhood could just take pride in the fact that people want to see what they have accomplished.

> What about the people that do get addicted and don't know the full extent of what they got into?

As concerned citizens, you and I try to help them. We raise awareness, we help with treatment, we provide resources. But what we don't do is create a problem for everyone else who doesn't have a problem.

> As for children, I'm not sure it works that way.

Sure it does. You have no right selling drugs to a child. You can't sell them a loaded handgun or an IED, either. Just in case you were wondering. :)

>  You can enter short term contacts like buying goods without parental consent.

But only some goods. A child can't buy everything an adult can buy.

> But even if that isn't the case, would libertarian society say no to children being able to give consent?

Yes, a libertarian society would say no. Granted, libertarians can't agree on when the ability to give consent begins. But in almost every large society, the line is fairly arbitrary, so I don't think the problem is uniquely a libertarian one.

> Secondary hypothetical, what if they paid shitty parents to give their kids drugs?

If the kids are harmed, then you can make the case that the parents harmed the kids since the kids were not able to make the determination for themselves. In that case, it would be like any other form of child abuse and handled as such.

> I don't necessarily support drug prohibition because you're right about organized crime.

That's good to hear! A lot of people ignore this point and it's the cause of so much violence and crime in our society.

> But would reduced prices just massively increase consumption to the point of destitution?

I don't think so. I mean, do the majority of people drink to the point where they just can't afford it any more? I think people have a certain amount of free time, and in that time, they drink, get high, gamble, whatever. Certainly, some might start using drugs when they otherwise wouldn't have. But that's one of the risks of a free society.

Just look at alcohol. It has destroyed lives, killed people by impairing their judgment, etc. We tried banning it. That causes even more death and destruction. So we educate people about the dangers. Why can't we do that with other substances as well?

> And a lot of countries have programs for addicts but many are still addicted.

Certainly. I would venture to say that no system will get rid of every last addict. Does that mean that all systems are failures?

> As for the FDA, fairly compelling argument.

Thank you. 

> Although concerns still arise with people being allowed to buy food that may kill themselves, especially uninformed consumers.

You know, there are FDA-acceptable local-health-code-approved restaurants that I won't set foot in. On the other hand, I've purchased homemade tamales from a migrant woman in a parking lot. People set their own standards and accept the risk. If you make people sick or kill them with your food, you're going to be in a lot of trouble in a libertarian society. So people are going to take precautions not to do it. I should have the right (inherently, BTW) to be able to purchase a glass of lemonade from my neighbors' kids.

So how are your ""interests"" in my private life more important than my interests in my own life?

> What if I paid you to take heroin or cocaine of your own free will to get addicted and then sell those drugs to you.

First, I can refuse the money. Second, I can take the money and take the drugs without necessarily becoming addicted. People do use cocaine recreationally. So you can't really compel me to become an addict.

> What if I did this to susceptible children?

Children can't give consent, so you aren't allowed to do that.

> Or to say nothing of the dependency and lengths people are willing to get more drugs and cause crime.

Drugs are insanely expensive because they are illegal. By supporting drug prohibition, you are supporting organized crime on a massive scale. Legalization would eliminate cartel crime. It would also bring addicts out of the dark into the light where they could actually be helped.

> should we just abolish the FDA and make it a free for all?

You could keep the FDA, but even if you didn't, private organizations could regulate food companies and report on food safety. Companies similar to Consumer Reports and Underwriter's Laboratories would approve or disapprove certain foods. Many stores wouldn't even allow unapproved foods into their stores since they don't want their customers getting sick. Some stores might try to gain market advantage by using stricter companies with higher standards than even the FDA. Consumers would decide how important safety is to them.

Each package of food might have a bar code you scan which can connect you to an updated recall database that will tell you in real time if that exact package came from a bad lot. The possibilities are endless. But they don't exist now because everyone just assumes our food is safe because the govenrment is taking care of it. Until the next sal manella outbreak occurs, that is.

Anyhow, just some things to think about. Libertarianism could work quite well in an informed, free society.",5,0,1444547368,1444718568

Oh, absolutely. But I think there are far more poor and distressed women in the business than rich ones. But yes, those rich ones exist and I think for them, the job is pretty dang empowering. They are literally screwing guys out of their money.

f(n) = f(n-2) + f(n-1) for all integers n >= 3

So you have f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 1 due to the base case. Since you have f(1) and f(2), when you plug n=3 into the equation, you get f(3) = f(1) + f(2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Now that you have f(2) and f(3), you can get f(4) once again using the equation: f(4) = f(2) + f(3) = 1 + 2 = 3. As long as you keep iterating through integers, you'll continue to get the next number in the sequence.
