cvwliyy,0,t1_cvwej3i,Gregorofthehillpeopl,"Few problems you've got.  

The most fundamental one is that people who don't know the basics of firearms, are attempting to write laws about firearms.  It's not limited to firearms, but that's besides the point.  

As it was shown to you earlier: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3obgor/cmv_mass_shootings_are_irrelevant_compared_to/cvw4l81

By trying to ban guns that ""look tactical"", you end up banning most guns.  

So let's say we wanted to ban sports cars.  So we wrote a law to ban all cars that can go over 90 mph.  That's pretty much every car.  But it's cool, because it's not like you need to go 90mph.  ""What if they put in a governor?"" you ask?  Since those could be removed, we have to ban any car that is capable of going over 90mph.  We also ban any car with spoilers on them, because they *look* sporty.  Exhaust kits?  Ban them too, just to be sure.  Those fake side grills on cars?  Ban them too, claims of lives saved that can't really be backed up statistically are at stake.  Do you think by banning 99% of all cars you'd be called a ""car grabber""?  Or that it'd be fair if people said you were trying to ban cars?  

The overwhelming majority of guns today are semi automatic.  Pretty much everything but revolvers, shotguns and bolt action rifles.  Know the glocks the police carry?  Semi automatic.  If you want to ban semi automatic guns, the police go back to revolvers.  The AR15 is the F150 of rifles.  They're everywhere.  Can you imagine someone saying ""I'm not anti automobile, I just want to ban all Fords""?  

To your question of ""tactical hunting rifle"", it really doesn't matter.  If you don't like it, don't buy one.  It's someone else's constitutional right to own one if they want.  It doesn't bother you in the slightest if you're not bigoted about it.  Fun thing about firearms, they're not always used for one purpose.  Some people like shooting, some people like the idea of personal defense, some people believe it holds back a tyrannical state, some people like to own firearms because their ability to get to their gun is faster than the local police response time, some people live in areas where the police have told them ""Seriously, we're far away.  You should get a gun"", some people live in bad areas (go google ""roof koreans"").  There's lot of reasons to own guns, as it's their right to.  

I just don't see why you feel the need to infringe on people's lives.
