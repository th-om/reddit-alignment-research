cvx89iu,1,t3_3oe367,Swolemageddonfour,"He would walk it, as a candidate he has even after nearly two terms none of the downsides of Hilary (previous scandals be they real or not and he isn't super old).  He could run on the economy which is the singularly most important issue for sane voters.  

The Republican field has had to run to frankly crazy positions due to Trump, plus the demographics are still going to the Democrats direction and that is before you get to simple name value Obama is as a two time winner.

Being ideologically pure and only dealing with people that believe EXACTLY what you think is reserved only for those with no actual power and influence or single issue types he is neither and therefore clearly he will deal with whoever gets him the most.

Out and out Libertarianism will most likely always be a niche political viewpoint so spending huge on Libertarian party candidates would seem to be a fools endeavour whether you support those views or not.",3,0,1444652654,1444720728
