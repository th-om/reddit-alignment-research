Just go to that link and mouse over everything, explanation in the sidebar.

cvsxoy1,0,t1_cvslqov,BornInATrailer,"While I don't put any stock into ""God given"" because I am an atheist, I do put some stock into natural.  We're a social, cooperative animal.  While we have far more exotic moral concerns than any other animal, do you think basic fair play and the golden rule have nothing to do with this evolutionary history?

> The only thing stopping my neighbor from clubbing me to death and taking all my stuff is a societal contract that is upheld by the government and enshrined in the constitution.

I think what you should emphasize is the social contract.  This existed long before any constitution.  I would say it existed long before any form of government.  A communal, tribal society is pretty darn rudimentary to call ""government"" and some form of social contract is clearly in play there.

> They are shared values we can hopefully all agree on but let's not pretend that they somehow exist independent of the government and society we live in.

I think you are misreading what point people are trying to make with regard to individual rights, whether they feel they are bestowed by a higher power or decidedly otherwise.  I think the point is more that government does not provide these rights, people do, society does.  That people should not look to government to define this because governments sometimes go off the rails and the larger social contract may or may not agree with a government.  Really the point is that the government isn't ""granting"" you rights but (hopefully) the government is properly recognizing the rights people have.  That social contract **does** exist independently from government; otherwise we wouldn't have governments abusing their own citizenry on a wide scale as (you point out) we've had many times in history.    

Lastly, my follow up was more about people getting hung up on the ""God given"" aspect of this.  While some take this to a silly extreme, focusing on that I think misses the meat of the point about where our rights come from.  But I like talking about the larger question of how we define morality and individual liberty so its all good.",3,0,1444337861,1444731156
