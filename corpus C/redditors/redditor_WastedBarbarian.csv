cvxt3kx,0,t1_cvxrusl,WastedBarbarian,"Thank you for saying that. It really is rough. I fought for a year to stay in, almost completely due to my debt. If I hadn't had the load, I would have been out a long time ago. I haven't officially dropped yet, on a year leave from school to try to figure out my life, but I am pretty sure I'm going to start the paperwork. 

I'm just worried that whatever path I take next, I may end up in the same situation, and that's something I want to avoid. Trying to find something to do for 30+ years is a daunting task. ",2,0,1444709407,1444727010
cvxn1zs,0,t1_cvxkas8,WastedBarbarian,"It is nuts.  I was not in the right position to make the decision.  I was sort of pushed into it.  Coming out of high school medicine was really interesting and I loved shadowing docs, I even got into the OR to watch and wanted to be a surgeon.  I've told myself and others that if I had gone the traditional 4+4 route, there is no way that I would have been interested in medicine as a career.

An MBA is on my radar, so is a Masters of Finance.  Law is not really an option.  The real factor holding me back in this load of debt on my shoulders.",2,0,1444699494,1444727010
cvxmwxq,0,t1_cvxjvps,WastedBarbarian,"I've definitely considered this route, but it just isn't happening.  I get very anxious and depressive just thinking about going back into that environment.  It's hard for me to even go to the city without feeling down.  It's not for me.  ",1,0,1444699288,1444727010
cvxh9qd,0,t1_cvxh3yv,WastedBarbarian,"I appreciate your confidence. I really came out without skills that transfer out of healthcare. For the few skills that I can find relevance, I don't think putting dropping out of medical school is a good thing to put on a resume. I'm really lost in finding a career.

cvx3k07,1,t3_3oghia,WastedBarbarian,"This article hits on several points on why I am personally leaving medical school.  My favorite quote from the article states, ""there’s only one thing that should drive you to med school: 'You have only ever envisioned yourself as a doctor and can only derive professional fulfillment in life by taking care of sick people.'”

I don't agree with the real point of the article, choosing nursing or PA over med school for the reasons he points out, but he does resinate with my why I'm leaving.  I joined a program straight out of high school and the only path I could do was medicine.  I can't even transfer any credits.  Luckily, I do get to leave with a Bachelor's degree (a pretty worthless one at that).  I'm $100,000+ in debt for a decision I made out of high school, potentially looking at about $40,000 salary.  

I know medicine isn't for me, but that doesn't mean that medicine isn't for others.  I have a much greater respect for physicians after leaving, than before I started, and always will.  ",14,0,1444670175,1444727010
