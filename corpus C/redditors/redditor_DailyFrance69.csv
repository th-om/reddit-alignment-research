cvxhe71,0,t1_cvxdgqn,DailyFrance69,"The ""cultural"" problem you mention is actually an economic one. There's an incentive for ""uncontrolled reproduction"" because it ensures offspring and thus more economic security. The same type of ""uncontrolled"" reproduction happened in European (and American) society before they became wealthy enough to not _need_ children.

It's politically incorrect to say it because you imply it's the fault of these people's culture that they respond to economic hardship in a way that people from every culture would respond. It's also a completely rational response for them individually, but unfortunately results in worse outcome overall.",2,0,1444690494,1444716490
cvww5w2,0,t1_cvww1ix,DailyFrance69,"""Double taxation"" doesn't exist. At least, not in the way most people think it does. _Everything_ is taxed double, triple, quadruple etc. Money is taxed when it changes hands: employees pay income tax, then if they buy something with that income, they pay a sales tax. Similarly, there's nothing weird about taxing Facebook on their income/profits, and then taxing the employee on _their_ income. That's how taxes work. 

There's nothing inherently wrong with ""double taxing"". We decided that we tax money when it changes hands because it's convenient to do so, and consistent. The result is that the same money or people will be taxed multiple times. It's when the ""double tax"" gets too high that there could arguably be a problem. We're nowhere close to that, as evidenced by the amount of taxes Facebook, an enormously profitable company, pays. ",-2,0,1444657635,1444716490
cvwrh1m,0,t1_cvwgkve,DailyFrance69,"Bullshit. If they were really _only_ against illegal immigration, they'd make it _much_ easier to immigrate legally. Hell, if they really didn't have a problem with legal immigration, but did with illegal immigration, _they'd just make all immigration legal_. Problem solved.

It is a fact that everyone is against immigration to some degree, legal and illegal. Republicans to a much higher degree than Democrats. Hiding behind ""I'm just against illegal immigration"" while your actions are demonstrably not consistent with ""just being against illegal immigration"" is disingenuous. ",0,0,1444641686,1444716490

It's especially hilarious that you say the Origen ""map plays"" cover him. You do know that a lot of the Origen ""map plays"" are _by xPeke_, right?",1,0,1444489988,1444716490

The rest of the team I'd concede that they're not extremely strong individually (although Soaz can absolutely crush anyone if he's on a roll, and Niels is a very consistent ADC), but to say they're ""weak individually"" is simply not true.

A. Vetoing unpopular bills repealing Obamacare is not ""sacrificing"" anything.

B. Acting like a petulant child trying to knock over things over and over because you can't get what you want won't endear the Republicans to the public.",6,0,1444401425,1444716490
cvtp06k,0,t1_cvtodu6,DailyFrance69,"Actually not. He makes the basic mistake of thinking of government debt as alike to household debt. They're not similar at all. A government can sustain a certain amount of debt pretty much indefinitely.

Moreover, he's conflating debt and deficit. He's talking about an ""ever increasing debt"", which would only be the case if Japan was continuously running a deficit. Maybe they are, but that's got nothing to do with whether or not the debt is sustainable, just the deficit.

On the scale of the government, debt is not something that needs to be paid off. It's simply a ""reservoir"" that money circulates in and out of. This circulation is not only sustainable, but actually profitable.",7,0,1444400077,1444716490
