Fuck off man, people like you are ruining reddit, turning it into one big pile of horseshit Reddit jokes rather than an actual enlightening conversation.  

Sad part about it is that your kind usually gets upvotes, looks like you just picked the wrong subreddit to be an idiot in for today.

Technically I should have failed and went to summer school but so many other kids in the class failed that it was uniformly decided it wasn't our fault because we literally could not understand her and could not learn, therefore we were granted a just-passing 75 grade from the higher-ups.  Took physics the next year and passed with flying colors, to this day I cringe when I see any formula resembling chemistry.",1,0,1444603605,1444729593

For some reason the show **Drawn Together** just popped in my head and I can only imagine the reaction of those two while live-tweeting their disgust.  Man I miss that show it was pretty much everything they hate wrapped up into a animated show.

cvni6n6,0,t1_cvndywr,pear1jamten,"Bullshit just plain bullshit, if you can't talk for the NYPD then don't because you have no idea what you're talking about.  Every god damn cop I know in the NYPD admits to having a quota and can't do shit about it because the city makes a killing off of it.  Every few years theres a huge blowup in a local newspaper about quotas and nothing ever gets solved because the police aren't dumb enough to put it in writing and our council-members are scared shitless of the police union.  As someone who has been a victim of this joke of a system your post is patronizing and a huge middle finger to many people who grew up in NYC and have experienced the quota system firsthand.

I wish I could be of a more calm mind and write such an elegant comment like yours but I can't, I and every single person I know have been shit on by the NYPD relating to the quota system to talk about it in a normal demeanor.  ",7,0,1443934749,1444729593
cvni1on,0,t1_cvnfy09,pear1jamten,"Man fuck shit this I grew up in Queens and still live in NYC.  I have many friends that are cops that admit to quotas from their officers.  It's so fucking frustrating because every few years a newspaper will go forward with a whistleblower claiming quotas are a huge deal and then it disappears, NOTHING EVER HAPPENS.  There is literally nothing that can be done to get rid of it because our representatives are scared shitless of the police union and their bullying tactics. 

I try not to think about it because the amount of anger that builds up as someone who has received bullshit summons + tickets before is through the roof.  The quota system feeds off the poor and middle class then proceeds to make them take off a day of work (if they were unlucky enough to get a summons) and then fuck them up the ass with humongous fines.  The system is fucked.",25,0,1443934407,1444729593
