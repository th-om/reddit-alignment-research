cvu1svm,1,t3_3o4wz1,smurphy1,I read a lot of macro stuff because I find it interesting but a lot of what I've read seems like it would offer very little help in terms of investing (unless you figure out a model that let's you time recessions).,1,0,1444419490,1444716676
cvu0fj2,0,t1_cvtx2zm,smurphy1,From which sector? Prolonged net deficit spending from the private sector has ended in a depression 7 times out of 7. Forcing the government into a net surplus means the private sector is in net deficit by definition.,4,0,1444417413,1444716676
cvu0cod,0,t1_cvtpagp,smurphy1,"You can't just consider the government budget in a vacuum. Changing the government net budget position has  direct effect on the net budget position of the other sectors of the economy. The short version is that if you force the government to run a balanced budget (or worse a surplus) while running trade deficit you force the private sector into a net deficit position which is very unstable and has ended in a depression every time. A government deficit is preferred because the private sector has a solvency constraint but the federal government, by virtue of being the currency issuer, does not and so a government deficit is not unstable like a private sector deficit is.",2,0,1444417295,1444716676
cvtykio,0,t1_cvtvo9w,smurphy1,That and having a central bank targeting an interest rate means that there can't be a constraint on more reserves so long as it wants to maintain its target. The only thing this will do is increase banks borrowing costs which will be passed on to consumers.,1,0,1444414642,1444716676

cvszhsm,0,t1_cvsyex8,smurphy1,There is a school of thought called MMT. It has no association with any Chicago based school of thought. They are very much in favor of fiscal stimulus (probably the most pro fiscal stimulus group out there) so I think there is a bit of confusion here.,7,0,1444340585,1444716676
cvsqh6k,0,t1_cvsgfwk,smurphy1,Agree the number one thing I want to see is how well the planner works with manuver warfare. So far none of the previewers have had enough experience to know how to demonstrate if it can or not.,7,0,1444327451,1444716676
cvsqf0l,0,t1_cvspbpo,smurphy1,"Podcat has stated that the planning bonus comes from having and preparing a plan not from following it. So if you have a plan to invade with no arrows, prepare for a bit and then manually control all your units you still get the bonus. You don't get the bonus if caught without a plan at all.",1,0,1444327358,1444716676
cvsmx8c,1,t3_3nvksl,smurphy1,"Most of his post is incorrect. Reserves are not a prior constraint to lending nor are they ""multiplied up"". The money multiplier exists only as an expost accounting ratio.",1,0,1444322254,1444716676
