The conflict has many decades of history that all weigh on the present, and of course its impossible to understand everything until you've done a lot of homework. It's not impossible, but reading up at least the wikipedias on the history of the Levant region, of jews in arabia, of jews in europe, of jewish biblical history, of Ottoman-era politics, of British colonial politics in the region, of the history of the arab civilization of the region, of the muslim religious history of the region, of pan-arabism, of islamism, of zionism, of palestinian nationalism, of jewish immigration to palestine, of the conflicts and wars that have been fought since the 1910's... that would be a good start.

But for starters... as others have said there has been a recent spate of knife attacks on the part of arab Israelis and Palestinians on jewish israelis, as well rock attacks targeting moving cars, and car ramming attacks on pedestrians. This is not an entirely new phenomenon. There are has been a spate of attacks this month, but such attacks, especially the rock attacks on moving cars and ramming attacks on pedestrians waiting at cross-walks and bus stops, has been a regular occurrence for over 1 year now, and several jewish Israelis had been killed even before this recent spate.

The run-up in violence has created ethnic tension and a sense of chaos that has people grasping for security. Some people on both sides are succumbing to their tribal instincts and old vendettas. Many israelis see in it a continuation of decades of brutal attacks on their people all while palestinians have never offered a realistic proposal for coexistence. Palestinians I imagine see it as a continuation of decades of proud struggle against people who stole their home.

Most of the palestinian deaths have been of people either in the act or fleeing an attack they had just committed, or at violent and dangerous ""demonstrations"" (as they are often termed in the media) but unlike a ""demonstration"" as I am familiar with in the media, these demonstrations don't consist of signs and chants and sit-ins, but rather slinging rocks and throwing molotov cocktails at Israeli soldiers. Israeli soldiers use tear gas, rubber or foam tipped bullets, and low power .22 bullets to repel these ""demonstrators"" attacking their checkpoints, but all of those things are still dangerous and still can easily cause death.

I will say something that nobody else in on this subreddit will probably offer: Israelis through their culture and history have adopted a very, maybe you would call it nihilist or amoral, perspective on trying to prevent these sorts of attacks on civilians. It is part of a concept in israeli politics that they call ""deterrent"". It goes back decades to the '70s when Israel was fighting early palestinian terrorists who were blowing up buildings, hijacking airplanes, hijacking buses, hijacking cruise ships, murdering civilians in their home, basically wantonly terrorizing Israel in an authentic version of the word. And part of that perspective, is, basically, that Israelis don't believe that a terrorist should be allowed to leave the scene of an attack alive. If they get away and they have to be arrested that's a different thing, they don't usually just hunt people down and execute them without a trial except in special cases. But if a palestinian terrorist is caught in the act or fleeing the act of an attack on israelis, the social and cultural norm in Israel is to shoot to kill with the idea being that it maximizes deterrent to develop the perception that you don't survive attacking Israelis. 

So as to why there is such a high mortality rate amongst the people caught stabbing Israelis... in America depending on where you are and what police officer is responding they might put different levels of effort into trying to corner the suspect or try to overpower them without killing them. It would be true to say that in Israel its mostly shoot to kill.",1,0,1444706078,1444717890
cvxacwb,0,t1_cvxa8bc,tuna_HP,"Read what I said. I said nothing about ethnic backgrounds required to be Israeli. I was saying that the current event that the news is talking about isn't a conflict of Israelis vs. Palestinians, it is a conflict between jews and arabs, with the significant number of arab Israelis being on the opposite side of the current violence from other Israelis who happen to be jews.",1,0,1444679977,1444717890
cvxa3h3,1,t3_3oh07g,tuna_HP,"You are reading incorrectly into the language that the Israeli news is using, and also are completely oblivious to the real language bias, that in arab media and culture.

Israeli differentiates ""jew"" vs ""arab"", rather than ""israeli"" vs ""palestinian"", when they are making a distinction in a situation where the conflict is between jewish citizens of Israel on the one hand and between arab citizens of Israel as well as arab palestinians on the other hand. It simply would be less clear and more ambiguous to say ""Israelis"" and ""Palestinians"" because some people who are Israeli (arabs) are stabbing other israelis (jews), and meanwhile who exactly are the palestinians- do they include arab israelis, do they include some or all jewish Israelis?

It is not a conspiracy to propagandize the world against the palestinians, it is simply the only clear way of describing events. If the case was that it was only arab palestinians who were stabbing Israelis of all ethnic backgrounds, jew and arab, I am sure the news would describe the attackers as ""palestinians"" and the victims as ""Israelis"", but that is not the case.",6,0,1444679610,1444717890
cvwk3nb,0,t1_cvwiwfb,tuna_HP,"Not every judge is perfect. Its just common sense to prevent runaway judges from inciting international diplomatic incidents that do more damage than whatever gains of pursuing the judge's orders. In America we had a judge who let a kid get away with killing someone while driving on drugs because he said he didn't know any better because he was brought up too rich to understand consequences. Judges aren't infallible. 

Also, some people want to single out Israel as the cause of all the evil in the world. The reality is that most of the new apartments in the most expensive parts of London are being bought by people with ties either to the brutal Russian regime or various brutal arab regimes. Sure, try to trick the Israeli former general into walking into a trap, while at the next gate over in Heathrow you're welcoming with open arms the Russian mobsters that own all your sports teams and the arab sheiks, the ones that are constantly raping their maids and ethnically cleansing their minorities, that fill all your luxury stores.",-4,0,1444620015,1444717890
cvwisuc,1,t3_3occfl,tuna_HP,"The article mentions that he was flying on El Al Airlines, the national carrier of Israel. El Al has a history of being targeted for hijackings and other attacks, so they have different security procedures than any other airline. Including having both uniformed and undercover air marshals on every flight. All armed, all ex-military, all specially trained for firefights aboard airplanes. Interesting piece of trivia, every El Al plane also has a belly-mounted missile defense pod with missile radar and either decoy flare launchers or an infrared laser jammer, designed to defeat shoulder fired anti-aircraft missiles. 

As to why they let the plane go... from the article's description it sounds like a random judge ordered the arrest warrant based on a private lawsuit, not based on charges from a prosecutor. Obviously as soon as higher ups in the British government started hearing that a single judge was about to cause a major international incident with Israel, and possibly a bloodbath at Heathrow, they nixed the operation.",-3,0,1444617684,1444717890

I know a lot of commenters on this sub are American, as am I, and its natural to project our American-style definition of ""freedom of speech"" onto other countries. But there is no other country with such an extremist definition of freedom of speech as america and most european countries would have already banned an organization which provides nothing positive to community and is notable only for marauding the streets screaming ""death to arabs"".

I actually commented on another thread a few months back that Israel should ban Lehava.",15,0,1444424082,1444717890
cvtnges,0,t1_cvtklth,tuna_HP,"He's talking about a policy to make chicago's streets have fewer cars, so that there's not traffic and to be more friendly to pedestrians. Due to the phenomenon of *induced demand* there's no way to achieve that besides a congestion charge. It's not such a crazy idea. Although it would only be smart to implement in busy areas at busy times where there are very good public transportation options. ",13,0,1444397183,1444717890
cvsiw8d,1,t3_3nvxvr,tuna_HP,"Prejudice against muslims is of course as aspect of US politics, but to a lower degree prejudice against jews is as well and I am concerned by the outright denial of any problem at all amongst posters in this thread. 

Just because the United States supports Israel, and just because expressing classic antisemitic canards is no longer socially acceptable in most settings, doesn't mean that a significant percentage of the US population doesn't hold prejudiced views. The leading jewish rights advocacy group estimates that [14% of Americans are *strongly* antisemitic](http://archive.adl.org/presrele/asus_12/4680_12.html#.VhZ8TRNVhBc), which make up some part of the 33% of Americans that believe that jewish Americans are more loyal to Israel than to America, and the 30% who believe that jews are collectively responsible for the death of Jesus.

Thankfully antisemitism is not often expressed in the media, by elites, or by most of mainstream engaged society. But antisemitism is common in America on the political far right and political far left, amongst african-americans (who are believed to be influenced by the antisemitic teachings of Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam as well as the popularity of some highly conservative christian religious groups amongst blacks, which also express antisemitic ideas), and amongst latino americans although the effect is highly influenced by whether they were born abroad or in america (latinos are believed to be influenced by the ultra-conservative brands of Catholicism that are often preached in South America that have included many antisemitic teachings).

Its also worth remembering our history, only a few decades back isnt too far to remember. Before Pearl Harbor and FDR bringing the US into World War II, not insignificant portions of American citizens were politically pro-Nazi, even holding pro-Nazi rallies with thousands in attendance on US soil, and expressing Nazi-derived antisemtic rhetoric in America. Large portions of the American German, Austrian, Italian, and Irish ethnic populations wanted the US to ally with the Nazis. The United States also refused to admit jewish refugees who even at the time were known to face likely death in Europe, including a famous incident where a boat of jewish refugees was [turned away from American docks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_St._Louis).

Even in the aftermath of World War 2, there is sharp criticism of treatment of American treatment of the liberated inmates of the Nazi concentration and death camps, which included forcing them to continue living in those same camps in mostly the same conditions, now alongside their former guards and other nazis, for months and years after they were theoretically liberated. Additionally, the USA did not support Israel from its founding, it was actually originally opposed. Contrary to popular belief, Israel received most of its earliest foreign support from the Czech Republic and France, not from the USA, which did not begin to advocate for Israel in earnest until the 1960's.",1,0,1444316262,1444717890
cvsfkp4,1,t3_3nyud6,tuna_HP,This is all incredibly inflammatory of course but there's something to be said about the difference between growing up as a light skinned person raised by your educated white mom in Hawaii and a dark skinned person raised in black ghettos by an illiterate impoverished black mother who married when she was 13. ,45,0,1444310481,1444717890
cvs2fzf,0,t1_cvrvvz3,tuna_HP,"> There are some deep-running BS going on at the UN for decades now. The main problem is ultimate veto power from the Big Five.

I don't know much about the UN, but how could this possibly be? We have a lot of differences of worldview and agenda from Russia and China, but at least we can deal with them. They both live in the real world and are playing realpolitik and thus to some degree are predictable.

Giving control of the UN over to the masses of countries, most of which are terrible and hopelessly corrupt? I mean, Russia and China are corrupt is well, but kind of like america in that our corruption aligns with the interests of our major domestic industries, and that we are all big and stable enough to have a strong interest in the general stability of the world.

Most countries, which each have an equal vote at the UN as the USA, are hopeless shitholes, whose leaders are either completely owned by private interests, or who are repressive warlords, or both, who are too concerned about their own short term survival as leaders and as people with their heads still attached to give two shits about global interests.

Like I said I don't know much about it, explain to me how increasing the power of Saudi Arabia, Belarus, North Korea, Chad, Syria, Congo, Turkmenistan, Iran, Eritrea, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Angola, and their ilk, is going to make the UN better?",3,0,1444271610,1444717890
