Well said. He isn't blind to the situation in congress. He wants to get people excited and involved in the political process, so he can pass some of his plans. And so far, it seems he definitely has that ability. ",1,1,1444714508,1444716362

Or will she look like the ""voice of reason"" next to Bernie's less-than-moderate rhetoric? Can't wait to see how this turns out.",1,1,1444712358,1444716362
cvxue5c,0,t1_cvxpuwk,no-sound_somuch_fury,"> I think Bernie has to go negative and try to knock her off her rehearsed answers and make her look rude and dismissive like Obama did. 

Excellent point. I really hope he does this, although he's been tentative to be aggressive towards her in the past. We'll see how it goes. ",1,1,1444712195,1444716362
