cvwh87k,1,t3_3oed8c,djm19,"1. As someone who has been involved and following the HSR debate in California, its far too simplistic to call this a ""liberal fetish"". That just is not the case.

>America is unique compared to Europe in terms of its wide open spaces

Nobody is really proposing at this point that you take HSR from LA to Chicago. Its more the intra-state travel. SD-LA-SF, or Dallas to San Antonio, or DC-NY-Boston.

>It takes massive investment.

As do so many things. And often the case is when we dismiss a technology like HSR, another type of capital investment is necessary anyway that actually costs more. 

>ends up being as expensive as air flight

Could be true, but is often not. HSR often replaces air travel in these corridors as the dominant mode when consumers are given the choice. 

>and is slower

That is a matter of debate. Obviously over a very long distance, rail will lose out. Across shorter distances, rail may have some advantages. HSR stations tend to be better located to a majority of the population, easier to access via public transit, less hassle when you actually reach the station (vs airports). So door to door they are competitive. 

>And it is obviously limited to where the track is laid.

That is true, but there are positives to that too. Its something dependable a city can build around. Concentrate construction. You can also of course hook up trunk-lines to spread the service elsewhere. 

>What's wrong with air travel?

There are some negatives to air travel. For one its hard to convert air travel to a more environmentally friendly power, and a lot of their harmful pollutants are localized to where the airports are, not thousands of feet in the air. 

Airline companies also tend to loath providing these shorter services. Longer trips are more lucrative and make more sense in fuel consumption per mile. And they tend to neglect these services. If you have ever been a regular on the LA-SF corridor (one of the nation's busiest) you know its prone to a lot of delays.
