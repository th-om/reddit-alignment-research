The majority of scientists think GMOs are safe; in fact, they're more confident in the safety of GMOs than human-caused climate change. Are you a climate change skeptic too?

The majority of scientists represents tens of thousands of people. How can Monsanto buy off scientists at this level? It's an insult to the scientific community to claim they will sacrifice human health on such a large scale (while risking their careers) to make a few bucks.

Why isn't there any credible evidence otherwise? 

Can you give me one reason how changing the DNA of an organism is dangerous? It's just DNA, and unlike their conventionally bred counterparts, GMOs are actually tested for allergenic and toxic proteins.

What about the mutagenesis breeding in certified organic crops? Are you okay with having your food's DNA randomly mutated by various radioactive agents, but not the more predictable and safer GM technology?

Also, it's clear that you haven't interacted with scientists much. I've actually never encountered an anti-GMO scientist before. From biochemists to the hippiest of ecologists, every scientist I've encountered in my career is supportive of GMOs. Are all of these scientists bought out too?",0,0,1444146478,1444725920

So that still leaves more than a thousand GMO studies that show they're safe. Where's your proof otherwise?

>and there is widespread evidence of corporations suppressing studies that disagree.

As I posted below:

Do you really think that tens of thousands of international scientists representing every developed nation and many developing nations have all united to conspire against human health?

We can't even get a few countries to agree on anything. How have they successfully untied to dupe public health without any dissenters?

Also, why aren't there any reputable studies that show negative consequences for human health? Any scientist who could prove this would be famous for centuries, likely receive a Nobel prize, and would get millions for the discovery.

>Major world governments have banned GMO food, so it's not as if there is overwhelming consensus on this issue.

This is merely a classic case a politicians suppressing the scientific community's position on an issue. We see this a lot with climate change in this country, but [scientists are actually more confident in the safety of GMOs than they are in human-caused climate change](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/).

Major world governments have also banned homosexuality. Does this mean it's right?

Can you provide any sort of proof that these countries used? The ironic part is that the EU represents a lot of these countries, yet they actually published a ten year review that affirms the safety of GMOs.

Research overwhelmingly supports that GMOs reduce pesticide use:

Here's a meta-analysis of 147 studies showing [GMOs reduce pesticide use by 37%](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629).

There are plenty of other sources that support GMOs reducing pesticide use, such as [this one](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X10001737) which found that GMOs reduce insecticide use by 55% in India.


[And another study showing that GMOs increase yields and reduce herbicide use by 40% in developing countries](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/124/3/923.full).

[A study of Chinese farms found GMOs reduce pesticide spraying, improving the farmers' health.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Search&doptcmdl=Citation&defaultField=Title%20Word&term=Pray[author]%20AND%20Five%20years%20of%20Bt%20cotton%20in%20China%20-%20the%20benefits%20continue)

Not to mention that the only data your source--Natural Society (biased?)--shows is a graph of neonic use. This isn't even a GM pestcide; it's widely used across the board.

In fact, when you read the linked paper (I doubt you did), it actually discusses hybrid crops--not GMOs. It discusses the use of neonic applications on hybrid seeds. ",3,0,1444068062,1444725920
cvooqnd,0,t1_cvokpy8,throwawayingtonville,">the non funny joke in all this is that new technologies are making transgenic crops obsolete.

Source? Why would somebody fund a huge laser assisted sorting/sampling setup when they can use GM technology quicker, more cheaply, and more predictably to achieve the same exact result? And going the GMO route to do it is more environmentally friendly, as it requires less space, energy, and resources.

>instead of addressing food security issues

What food security issues? Do you mean how GM crops grow more food on less land with reduced resources? This is seems to be the very definition of food security.

>some started to question the validity of the initial information

Who? Scientists are more confident in the safety of GMOs than they are human-caused climate change.

>e.u. nations opting out

I guess that didn't look at the EU's ten year review on GMO safety.

>as independent research showed observable effects from the g.m.feed and associated chemicals, there formed a growing number of scientists who questioned the early data

Like the heavily criticized Seralini who you always try to support. His papers were retracted after review by two independent panels. This is what happens when you use rats that are predisposed to cancer and combine them with a small sample size and are funded by a homeopathic company.

If he study was credible, why doesn't he just repeat it with a different strain of rat and a larger sample size? He'd be widely acclaimed and make millions. 

>science isn't static, we work with what we've got.

Like the thousands of studies that have found GMOs to be safe without a single reputable study showing otherwise?

>the g.m.food companies had their chance

And still do, which is why when a GM crop is available farmers overwhelmingly choose it.",2,0,1444026520,1444725920
cvom3kz,0,t1_cvo4l0a,throwawayingtonville,">Are you speaking for me?

No. You are implying that the scientific community knows that GMOs are dangerous and being paid off to support the false notion at the expense of global health, like when you said:

>It is very easy to see why people do what they do, money and the promise of keeping their jobs.

And like I said above, that would require tens of thousands of scientists all being paid off at the expense of losing their careers--all on an international level representing a ton of countries. We can't even get the U.S. to agree on policies, much less tens of countries to agree on something secretly that would harm global human health.

Not to mention that not a single one of these tens of thousands of scientists has developed a guilty conscience and come out and admitted the whole thing is a sham cover up, which they originally agreed to at the potential expense of their career and certain detriment to humanity.

>Cite all thestudies you like. I can cite the rat study that produced tumors too!

Which was retracted by independent panels and debunked many times over. How many of the thousands of studies affirming the safety of GMOs have been debunked?

>You haven't forgotten that one issue where a shit ton of studies were all retracted because they were found to be signed by people that hadn't signed off on them? Don't remember?

No, I don't because that didn't happen. Seralini comes to mind who was criticized for using rats that are predisposed to cancer and a small sample size. 

If his results were accurate, why doesn't he just use a different subspecies of rat with a larger sample size? He'd become world-famous, make millions, and be regarded as one of the most ground-breaking scientists. 

>People CAN be incredibly naive or gullible. You sound like you listen to the TV and take what it says as gospel

I don't own cable or watch TV. I've formed my opinion through years in agriculture and science. What have you formed your opinion from?

Can you tell me how a GMO could harm us? The act of modification itself just alters DNA. They're tested for allergenicity, unlike conventionally bred plants, which have actually produced toxic and allergenic proteins. DNA itself won't harm you or alter your DNA. Just like when we eat a chicken, we don't form talons, a beak, wings, or feathers. 

>Too much apathy and acceptance to what the media tells you

Or rather more than a decade in science. Still curious what your opinion is based off.

>WILL be misinformed.

By thousands of studies. The only study you mentioned was retracted based off multiple independent reviews.

I am curious how Monsanto alone can buy off the consensus of tens of thousands of scientists. Let's say there were 20,000 scientists willing to ruin their career and human health for a $1,000 pay off. That would be $20 million from Monsanto right there. I'd say it'd easily take $10,000 per head to risk ruining their career and humanity, increasingly the price tag to $200 million--and that's a very modest estimate.

Plus the cost of buying congress as you mentioned. 

Plus the cost of buying peer-reviewed journals. 

Plus the cost of buying the media. 

Plus the cost of the materials for the thousands of faulty studies. Molecular biology is very expensive, by the way.

That's easily in the hundreds of millions shelled out all to these tens of thousands of people willing to sacrifice humanity for a buck.

Do you really believe this? Yet, I'm the one who is 'naive' and 'gullible.'",1,0,1444019279,1444725920

>I guess my only last issue would be around the intellectual property of it.

This is already how modern agriculture operates. Hybrid, certified organic, heirloom, and other conventional crops are patented. 

With GM technology, it takes (tens of) millions to create a product, so the patents exist to ensure a profit for the company. 

It generally requires, cloning, and phenotyping hundreds of genetic constructs to create a product. This also excludes the high costs of all the regulatory hurdles that a legal team navigates, field testing, hazard assessment, allergenicity testing, marketing, and sales. 

Also, GM crops ultimately go off patent, as we have already seen with [Monsanto's soy](http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/roundup-ready-patent-expiration.aspx).

>You have a handful of companies (Or one) controlling food supply for everyone.

A handful is more accurate. I just recently posted a list of some of them:

Dow: [About 55,000 employees](http://www.statista.com/statistics/267332/number-of-employees-at-dow-chemical-since-1999/)

Monsanto: [About 22,000 employees](http://www.monsanto.com/investors/pages/faqs.aspx)

Dupont: [About 63,000 employees](http://www.forbes.com/companies/ei-du-pont-de-nemours/)

BASF: [About 113,000 employees](http://www.statista.com/statistics/281383/number-of-employees-at-basf/)

Syngenta: [About 28,000 employees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syngenta)

Bayer: [About 120,000 employees](http://www.investor.bayer.com/en/faqs/)

There are other, smaller players too, such as Pioneer, Mycogen, Nufarm, Nunhems, etc. Even though there is strong competition, I would certainly be in favor of more.

The problem here is--as mentioned above--the cost of the legal aspect. I don't want GMOs to be unregulated, but I think it would be beneficial to facilitate the startup of new biotech companies. 

My expertise is in science, and honestly, I'm not sure the best solution here. One possibility would be more freedom to conduct the research to create a GM product initially, but ultimately subjecting any marketable product to the same rigorous standards that all commercial GM crops currently are held.

>If as you say other farmers will not be able to compete

Organic produce sells are already on the rise. 

Also, with GM crops going off patent, farmers will be able to sidestep corporations and use the crops however they want, including saving seed if they choose to do so (which is never a viable option with hybrid crops).

The one exception would be certified organic crops, which by definition can't use GMOs; however, I think it would be in their best interest to allow it if all other current organic cultivation standards are met.",3,0,1444018375,1444725920
