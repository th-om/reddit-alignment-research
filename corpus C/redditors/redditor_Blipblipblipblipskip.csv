cvvjv1v,1,t3_3o9x6x,Blipblipblipblipskip,"Isn't consciousness chemical reactions in the brain? So we die and our body begins to react to our environment more as our living mechanism has ceased. It's possible that these increased chemical reactions could be experienced by our deceased consciousness. Who's to say we don't experience hyperconsciousness after dying. Also depending on how much of our consciousness is connected to our bodies outside of the brain maybe we can experience the dispersal of our matter into the environment. Then our conscious mind is the chemical reactions of the environment itself and we experience it together because we are all part of it. It would be a collective consciousness, a sea of consciousness. It's not that we didn't experience before we were born, ""I""  didn't experience before I was born and that is the difference. After I die what is left is ""We"" because we are all the same then. This ego and individual is temporary but this matter and energy I am composed of is eternal. ",4,0,1444540168,1444723107

cvsf8we,1,t3_3nym87,Blipblipblipblipskip,"I used to work for a guitar company so I would get gear for super, super cheap. I also am not very impulsive when it comes to buying gear so the most I've ever spent is probably around $1000. Now, I play often and have done touring in the past so I consider that to be a pretty low number considering my background. I do know people that think more money is equal to more guitar talent and they spend thousands at a time. More money does not equal more talent and they just have really pretty gear that gets played poorly. ",1,0,1444309816,1444723107

cvs7hla,1,t3_3nxg0b,Blipblipblipblipskip,"I would prefer more political parties. For instance, there should be a Socialist party, a hard right maybe even Nationalist party. Then we would have much more entertaining political satire and then we'd also have the Parliament get together and have to form a coalition government. Sounds a bit European? I like the European style of government. There would definitely be more right wing ministers in the US but a sprinkle of Socialism would force the populace to listen to it's valid points and provide a counter balance to a lot of our wild west roots in culture. 

I think religion plays far too big a role in government. Every damn politician has to be some form of bible thumper. People came here to escape the Church of England! To get away of repressive religion and managed to create their own form of religious oppression.

On the national level I have no doubt that evryone in government has no clue of the struggle of the common man. Even on the local level most people that end up in politics are successful business people, also keen on making money and not living with the idea of having to make ends meet. So no, I do not feel as though I am represented by the current form of US government. ",-1,0,1444282646,1444723107

Starts conversation about show because song is on, barista happily says they like the band, happens to mention they liked the band before the show, is relevant because show is main topic of conversation sparked by song, barista sarcastically says writers aren't even from Portland, OP makes mental note, will make me really popular on internet website, barista is an artist (don't they all have MFA's?) and is currently working on an installation, is racking up real points in the real world to people that are relevent to her life, might even be actually getting laid right now, OP is racking up fake internet points from people that don't matter and is on 4chan beating off to Japanime chicks with dicks.",3,0,1444281278,1444723107

cvkfm7t,1,t3_3n309w,Blipblipblipblipskip,"I admire the German/European system of education immensely. In the US we have ""for profit"" schools that advertise on tv quite a bit that of course over promise what you can accomplish. Then a lot of companies don't honor certification from those schools. 

I view the education system in the US as a business. They need your money. There are grants and interest free loans to apply for but I feel you can make a better living choosing a trade rather than gambling on a major four years ahead of time. If you love science and research that's fine, go to school and then work at the school. But it's disheartening to think I would have to live with another mortgage to do that (on top of not being able to pay the one I already have).",1,0,1443705021,1444723107

So, at least he's honest. To fault him for that also expresses that the public can't handle an honest politician. That may be true but I don't like it. If you can't handle ""We won't go to the moon because it is easy but because it is hard"" then you don't deserve a leader who will send you there.",1,0,1443467034,1444723107
