cvvu570,0,t1_cvvp81x,CalRipkenForCommish,"Ripken was taken out more times than most players, as his size was a hindrance to his mobility on the turn.  He understood the unwritten rules, which included his pitchers returning the favor on the opposing team, if not the offending player himself.  I might be old, but I understand the rules, written and unwritten.  ",2,0,1444575867,1444722665
cvvtx64,0,t1_cvvjnd1,CalRipkenForCommish,"Ripken's height and weight (6'4"", 200+ pounds) made him a target on every double play, but it was also that size that helped him absorb the beatings of barrel rolls and takeout slides.  He's a baseball first type of player, where the players policed themselves.  The Mets have a right to be pissed, but the unwritten rules allow for redemption.  If you don't understand that, you're either under 30 years old or never played the game.  ",7,0,1444575387,1444722665
cvvthgl,1,t3_3oamqq,CalRipkenForCommish,"Folks, we are watching this on a national television network, so you're not going to get the nuanced versions of what each commentator thinks.  Yes, some of you will say, ""then what are they being paid for?""  or ""what's the point of color commentary then?""  Yes, both are true, and in a perfect world, we'd get to hear that.  This is corporatism, folks, and it's the announcers' worst nightmare, to say negative things about a game they all love and cherish.  They won't besmirch the game.  This play is the penultimate of ""judgement calls"" in the game.  The ""neighborhood play"" is the most subjective in all of baseball, and, for better or worse, you got to see replay turn it into right and wrong from a technical perspective.  That's replay's downfall.  Be thankful it's not being used on balls & strikes.  

That said, my opinion is that the play was reckless and dirty, but legal.  Whether the announcers agree with me or not doesn't matter to me today, tomorrow or forever.  

All things in perspective, It's still looking like the Mets have the upper hand in this series.  Tomorrow, Mets fans will be shouting that Harvey better put his money where his mouth is and show up to pitch against a lineup that has been striking out at a ridiculously high rate.  Mets hitters should be able to break out against Anderson and thus put the Dodgers up against the wall.  ",0,0,1444574366,1444722665
cvvs4yc,1,t3_3oazk5,CalRipkenForCommish,"Here we go again with the ""takeout slide at second"" play.  On this occasion, mets fans (and anti-dodger fans like the giants fans) will yell, ""dirty play!""  Dodger and and anti mets fans (aka phillies fans) will shout, ""safe!""  The rest of America's baseball fans will be between ""reckless, but legal"" and ""aggressive"" on the spectrum.  Baseball will move on.  ",2,0,1444571007,1444722665
