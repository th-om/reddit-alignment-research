cvxatoh,0,t1_cvxaffg,RECIPR0C1TY,"The thing is, the OP's story is probably not fake (probably exaggerated for effect). And there are literally millions of other stories just like it. You easily dismiss them, but I have a coworker who is a single mother of two and one of the hardest workers I know. She probably makes 25,000 a year but has that iPhone, Comcast subscription, and various other unnecessary expenses. She is unintentionally abusing the system. She needs solutions to both problems, healthcare and dependency.",1,0,1444680646,1444718808
cvx9v7a,0,t1_cvx8amc,RECIPR0C1TY,"You keep posing this as an either/or scenario. You are absolutely right about healthcare. It is insanely expensive and figuring out how to bring down the cost is an important discussion. However, the OP is about the government paying for healthcare for those that don't deserve it. This is a problem that exists for all forms of government assistance.

As a conservative I am not for the blatant cutting of social welfare programs. I am for eliminating or drastically reducing the need for them so that the problem of dependency is addressed. You raise objections to an ""inefficient system"" which are fair. However, I personally believe that there are solutions like education and financial planners with discretionary authority to revoke assistance based on budgetary indiscretions. I think these can be successful in theory. The idea being that though they would be expensive upfront, they would pay for themselves by ending the perpetual dependency on assistance that many families are trapped into",1,0,1444679277,1444718808
cvx91co,0,t1_cvx8ndz,RECIPR0C1TY,"Makes sense to me. If said probation officer can get X-amount of people off assistance then their salary would be paid for. Assuming  all the probation officers can put a big dent in the ""recidivism"" (for lack of a better word) rate eventually the solution would pay for itself, though it would probably cost a lot up front.",1,0,1444678104,1444718808
cvx8ift,0,t1_cvx83zo,RECIPR0C1TY,"I think that is the cheapest option by far with the most logical implementation. I think something like this could be implemented as a requirement to receive assistance as well. 

I am no expert on how all this works, but I am fairly positive that in order to receive assistance people already have to give alot of financial information. Would it be that insane to require people to turn in a budget to a financial planner? This would probably be very expensive upfront for the government, but if it eventually cut down on the amount of people that continue to need assistance then it would pay for itself.",1,0,1444677339,1444718808
cvx85ks,0,t1_cvx71my,RECIPR0C1TY,"You aren't offering any solutions either. All you are doing is blindly defending governments assistance as if any attack on it is going to leave dead people in the streets. There are two problems here, poverty and dependence. They are both equally important. Instead of reasonably approaching both at the same time you demonize the person focusing on one problem instead of the other just like you are.

No, I don't have a solution either, but I do know that a solution starts with acknowledging both problems exist.",2,0,1444676823,1444718808
cvx7zuh,0,t1_cvx6uh6,RECIPR0C1TY,"I don't really have a solution, I am just a stay-at-home dad because I can't afford childcare.  I just think people need to stop ignoring the obvious problem of dependency on assistance when it is avoidable. The original response does just that. It is so defensive about government assistance that it avoids the very real problem of dependence. ",1,0,1444676591,1444718808
cvx7vjt,0,t1_cvx7ap0,RECIPR0C1TY,"You act like the solution only has to be one or the other. Is it so horrible that we prevent people on assistance from purchasing cigarettes and alcohol? Is it so horrible that we prevent people on food stamps from spending $120 on Comcast each month?

We can also find ways to bring healthcare down at the same time. This doesn't have to be an all or nothing proposition.",2,0,1444676411,1444718808
cvx7rm2,0,t1_cvx71my,RECIPR0C1TY,"I never even came close to saying that we should let people die in the emergency rooms or that we should stick the hospitals with the bill. You immediately jump to an extreme scenario without addressing the very real problem that the story brings up. There is an enormous amount of abuse (both intentional and unintentional) of the fact that the government offers assistance to those in need.

Most of the time the ""Left"" completely ignores this fact and just throws more money at the problem. This does not solve the problem any more than letting people die in the ER. Maybe we do need to police what people who are on assistance buy. Maybe we do need to force people off assistance that don't deserve it. I don't know. These are probably horrible ideas, but something has to be done to address both the issues of poverty and dependence. Just ignoring dependence like you did in your original response is as bad as ignoring poverty.",3,0,1444676256,1444718808
cvx7coj,0,t1_cvx6cmo,RECIPR0C1TY,"I don't have a statistic to back this statement up, just anecdotal experience. I constantly see people that abuse the system without the intent of abuse. They can afford their own health insurance and their own groceries at the same time. Not to mention people that can afford one or the other. They, quite simply, do not manage their money properly. 

I know of families on food stamps that will easily spend $500 on Christmas this year. I know families that collect government assistance that buy alcohol, Xbox games and HD Television sets. This isn't just a few people, this is normal.

At the same time, I realize that there are people living in next to nothing. They literally will not survive a winter without assistance. It is one thing for the government to take care of people in certain aspects of their lives. It is another to make that person so dependent on that assistance that they do not know how to survive without it.

With the continuing growth of welfare, something has to be done to make those that are able care for themselves. We absolutely should not slash welfare, but we absolutely cannot continue on our present trajectory.
