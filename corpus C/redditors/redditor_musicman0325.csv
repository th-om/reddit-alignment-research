I would imagine part of the issue in the Chinese system would be that there's more bureaucracy and bribing involved - so there's an ""unofficial approval"" process that operates alongside the legitimate drug approval process.",3,0,1428253481,1444726728

cigwd92,1,t3_291gf5,musicman0325,"Completely agree. Facebook has continuously adapted which has allowed it to stay relevant. The 2014 Facebook is different than the 2006 Facebook. That's just something MySpace never did, and what Tumblr doesn't do IMO.

Edit: Also Facebook is something that stays relevant even if you don't continuously update it. It's a way for people to keep in touch, which is the emphasis of Facebook. Tumblr on the other hand, prioritizes a user sharing and updating information, not necessarily the relationships that can be maintained.

So while Facebook is losing popularity with younger kids, that's not necessarily the end. People are using Facebook to keep in touch, not simply as a platform to share information.",8,0,1403722289,1444726728
