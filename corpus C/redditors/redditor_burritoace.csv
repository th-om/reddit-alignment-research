I don't think you can make this generalization. I grew up in a rural place (not in Western PA) and there were definitely people that relied on buses, rode bikes for transportation and recreation, and made use of public parks, myself included. In any case, they are services that we get thanks to our tax revenue, so lower taxes in rural areas definitely don't provide equivalent services.",2,0,1444667159,1444716783

Also, I feel like I should point out that as mentioned in the other comment string in this thread there are tons of architects practicing in this way, and have been doing so for decades. They are not the ones in the headlines or even the press, but are local architects who work within their own communities.",1,0,1444661139,1444716783
cvwxtg1,0,t1_cvwx8gx,burritoace,"[Here](http://www.mtlebanon.org/index.aspx?NID=254) is a chart from Mt. Lebanon, for example, which shows the total millage rate for a few suburbs and the City of Pittsburgh for 2014. The city also has a .25% library tax plus the 3% local Earned Income Tax (the suburbs also have EIT, but they are closer to 1%). As such, the difference in overall tax burden between somebody living in the city and the suburbs and working in the city is pretty small, and might actually tip in favor of the city. I think this is good to keep in mind, as people often reference the city's tax burden as a reason for moving to the suburbs. While I can't dispute that many suburban school systems are better than the city, the tax burden is not that different.",4,0,1444660902,1444716783
