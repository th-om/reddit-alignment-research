cum1mac,0,t1_cum1fc3,Seth39195,To be honest I'm not entirely sure. My fingers are on the small side and I had trouble finding something that fits on my ring finger. If anyone knows where I can get something for my pinky feel free to chime in. ,1,0,1441043207,1444730420
cum0r0j,1,t3_3j3qda,Seth39195,"It really comes down to personal preference. Duane Allman and Derek Trucks use glass and their ring finger. Delta blues guys is brass and their pinky finger. But there are no rules, try a couple slides and see what you like. The only thing I would recommend is making sure you can bend your finger at the bottom knuckle, otherwise you might have some difficulty reaching. ",3,0,1441041891,1444730420

It seems as though you are suggesting women stop fighting for equality because they face less disadvantages than they did in the past. That is similar to saying that after you lose your first 10 pounds you can stop working out because you are already more healthy than you were last month. It completely ignores that the goal of the movement is total equality, why would they stop at anything less?",5,0,1440997795,1444730420
