cvl4hvn,0,t1_cvksirs,nimbyest,"I don't know if you have ever stepped into a high school in the past few years, but most high school teachers are not trained to neutralize a shooter. That said, most people are also not always on the alert for a mass shooting. If one was to happen, most people would be totally caught off guard. Mass shootings normally aren't people mowing down hundreds of people in a crowded area. In the case of a mass shooting in a school it would immediately go into lock down, with most teachers and students barricaded in rooms. If the teachers were good shots then maybe they could limit the body count, but they could never avoid the initial shooting.",2,0,1443743526,1444724467
cvl496u,0,t1_cvkswrt,nimbyest,"There were mass shootings long before there were gun-free zones. Having armed guards in schools will not work if the shooter knows the building well and strikes without warning. An armed guard or possible bystanders with guns only work if they are actively chasing after the shooter.

Lets say there is a high school where a couple of the teachers have guns and there are armed guards walking around the campus. All the possible gunman needs is a surprise attack and most of the teachers are incapacitated due to the fact that they are now in lock down in the building meaning they cannot go vigilante mode and shoot the gunman. Armed guards walking around the school is another solution, however, many schools are underfunded and cannot afford the constant protection of ex military. 

I'll agree with you, gun free zones are pretty useless in the fact that criminals don't care about guns. However, saying that mass shootings would never happen if those areas weren't gun free is a total lie. Even if half the people in a theater had guns, they couldn't have stopped a guy with assault rifles and smoke grenades. If there were people with guns running around the elementary school in Newtown, they still couldn't have saved the tens of young children's lives that were killed in the start. Same goes with Charleston, a church normally is not on the ever vigilant watch for gunmen, and the same situation would take place even if most participants had guns.",2,0,1443743092,1444724467

cv67urc,0,t1_cv67k2z,nimbyest,"Cynical answer: CNN mostly cares about ratings and would love to make drama between candidates to make the debates funnier and appeal to a broader crowd.

Optimistic Answer: CNN wanted to get the candidates opinion on issues that were focused on them. Allowing Fiorina to personally respond to Trump about his comment in a way that couldn't be possible online. They wanted to speed up the debate by introducing questions that would lock two candidates in an argument.

Generally I would go with the more cynical answer. Mainly with the  question between Donald Trump and Ben Carson which was mainly made to cause drama between two front runner candidates that seemed to be getting along. The personal questions also seemed to lead into broader topics and more heated talks, specifically the Rand Paul / Christie marijuana one.",40,0,1442605799,1444724467

Secondly, Japan probably isn't #1 on any migrant's to go list. It's a very closed off country with little to no help for foreigners, there are a minuscule amount of  Syrians or outsiders living there (no sense of community), and if you look at a map Japan is a far ways from Syria, it would make sense for most migrants to go to Europe than make a trip across Asia to get to a country with no human traffickers that would boat them to it.",4,0,1442605180,1444724467

cukcjpz,0,t1_cuibzcg,nimbyest,"During the book, the entire Finch family goes to a church sermon. One of the pastors says the quote ""For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth"" from the Book of Isiah. This is most likely where Haper Lee, growing up in a religious oriented youth, got the reference. Also, in the book, Uncle Jack says the quote with the most clout ""Every man’s island, Jean Louise, every man’s watchman, is his conscience"". Looking at the title in context of this quote is more of a request by some being. Looking at the title in the context of both the quote and entire book's plot, it relates more to Jean Louise being independent from her view on Atticus and becoming her own person, thus setting her ""Watchman"" or Conscience.",4,0,1440901385,1444724467
