This is an interesting point. Biden hasn't been as prominent in Obama's administration as Cheney was in W's, but Biden's presence wasn't overpowering Obama's either. Still, he's successfully acted as Obama's representative on numerous occasions, and has acted as someone willing to question Obama and challenge him. All in all, I'd say Biden has been a fine VP.

""Ow, mommy!"" Cassie shouted out.

""Let me see your feet!"" Samantha commanded.

""No!"" Cassie writhed back and forth, ""Let me go!""

""Stop that!"" Samantha shouted at her, ""let me see them! Right now!""

""No!"" Cassie continued writhing, trying to get free of her grip.

""I said now!"" Samantha slapped her lightly on the face, which started her crying, but at least stopped her from moving around, and she moved the girl's feet until she could see the source of the blood: a vicious little shard of glass in her right foot. Samantha briefly considered looking for tweezers, but decided that she didn't want to have to chase down Cassie again, so she decided to pull it out with her nails.

""Ow, mommy! Mommy, that hurts!"" Cassie shouted in between loud sobs, but Samantha kept at it until she removed the glass. She placed it on a nearby counter, and then picked up Cassie, flung her over her shoulder, still crying, and went back to the bathroom.

Blood all over the floor. She tried to ignore it, and opened the medicine cabinet, grabbing the small first aid kit. She set Cassie's foot down in the sink and started the water on hot, and Cassie started wailing even louder. Grabbing the soap, she scrubbed the bloody area clean, and then reached for a towel to dry it, trying to choose the towel she liked the least, in case it got ruined. Finally, she squeezed out some Neosporin, and slapped a Band-Aid on the wound.

""There,"" she grunted.

""Why did you hit me?"" Cassie whined.

""I didn't hit you,"" Samantha said, trying to hide the fear in her voice. The last thing she needed was Cassie telling her teacher something like that.

""Yes you did!"" Cassie cried.

""No, I didn't, and you be quiet!"" Samantha shouted, ""Now, I *told* you to stay put! And what did you do?""

""I don't know..."" Cassie whined.

""What did you do, Cassie?"" Samantha insisted, ""I told you to stay put, and what did you do?""

""I don't know."" Cassie cried, among heavy sniffles.

""What did you *do*, Cassie?"" Samantha yelled, ""Tell me!""

Cassie turned her head down to look at the ground, ""I didn't stay put.""

""That's right,"" Samantha said, exasperated, ""why not?""

Cassie sniffed, and then mumbled, ""I don't know...""

""Agghh!"" Samantha yelled out, ""I don't have time for this! Cassie, put your shoes on, we need to go.""

""But I didn't get breakfast!"" Cassie pleaded.

""Too late,"" Cassie said sternly, ""You're just going to have to go hungry this morning.""

""But mooooom!"" Cassie begged.

""I said *no*!"" Samantha shouted at her, ""Now go get your shoes on! And stay out of the kitchen!""

Cassie stomped off to her bedroom, and Samantha weighed the mess in the kitchen and bathroom against the screaming baby, and opted to check in on Emmett, running to his crib and checking his diaper. No mess, thank god. Just cranky at being woken up. She might have found some irony in that, if she wasn't so depressed at how much work it had taken to get him to sleep in the first place.

Cradling the baby in one arm while walking back to the kitchen, Samantha set the baby down in his kitchen seat and grabbed the broom to start sweeping as best as she could manage, getting all the cereal and glass into a pile and using the dustpan to pick it up and set it in the trash. The trail of blood would have to be cleaned up later. She'd probably have to spend a good hour scrubbing, and it might never get out of the carpet.

""Okay, I have my shoes on,"" Cassie said, pouting.

Samantha looked down and saw they were Cassie's light-up shoes. They were against school dress code, and Cassie had already been sent home with a note for sneaking them past her to the school once before.

""No, Cassie,"" Samantha said, frustrated, ""Put on your *other* shoes.""

""But I like *these*!"" Cassie squealed, which started Emmet crying again.

""Do it!"" Samantha shouted at the top of her lungs, and Cassie squeaked and ran off.

Samantha reached down to grab the baby, to calm it, and saw the mail on the table, left unopened from yesterday after getting home late from the recital and not having the energy to look through it. Now in daylight, she saw among the bills and ads a letter in a pink envelope, covered in girly stickers and faded with time. It looked vaguely familiar, but she couldn't place it. Wondering what it was, she set Emmet on her knee and opened it with her other hand. Inside, she saw a note with her own handwriting:

> Hiya, Sam! This is you from the past! I don't know if this is gonna' work, but the guy at the post office says they can hold this for five years, so I think it will. I thought it'd be cool to talk to the me of the future.

> How ya' doing? I'm doing really great! Things are going really good with Dylan. We were talking about the future, and I thought, wouldn't it be a kick to write to myself five years from now and predict what things will be like for me? Then I can compare it to what actually happened, and it'll be a trip, seeing how right I was or how wrong I was!

> As I write this, I'm about eight months preggers. I feel kinda' self conscious about my weight and looking fat and all, but Dylan says that once the baby is born he can watch her while I go to the gym to regain my girlish figure, or we can hire a babysitter, or something.

> So I imagine that, by now, you've lost all the post-baby weight, and look like a total MILF. And Dylan says we can get a babysitter so I can finish my college degree, so by now, you should be well on your way to getting that nursing degree!

> Ha, of course, those are easy ones. Let's try to predict things that are a bit harder. I'm gonna' go ahead and say that the flying car is out, but with all that money Dylan's making in construction, I'm betting you probably have a sweet ride. Something sensible, though, like... I dunno, a Volkswagon?

> How am I doing so far? Pretty good, right? Well, let's see. We always said we wanted to tour Europe, but needed to save up for it, but right around now you've probably got tickets. Where'd you end up deciding on? Greece, or Germany?

> Finally, I'm going to guess you and Dylan are still having all kinds of fun sex. I can't see *that* ever getting old. Oh! And are you hanging out with Bob and Rita still? They have some wild parties... I bet you party every other night these days, right? I mean, responsibly, of course - don't want to drink too much around the kid, right?

> Anyway, I'm sure, whatever you ended up doing, your life is going pretty good right now. I really wish I knew... I can't wait to see it for myself! But now, you have. Was it everything you wanted?

When Cassie came back into the kitchen, now wearing the right pair of shoes, her mother was sitting at the kitchen table, her face buried in her arms, sobbing.",2,0,1444684165,1444717095
cvxdbc6,1,t3_3ofadl,CaspianX2,"The alarm clock rang again. Samantha's hand flung out from the bed to silence it, and slowly she forced herself out from under the covers. She paused for a moment, the task of simply standing up seeming painful, but noting the time, she forced herself to rise, and walked over to the bureau to find something suitable to wear.

She looked through the drawers, their contents in disarray, found something to wear that wasn't too wrinkled and horribly mismatched, and threw it onto the bed before walking into the bathroom.

No time to shower. There was never time for anything. It seemed like a small miracle every morning when she got Cassie to school on time and getting through traffic quickly enough to show up at Worthington's before her supervisor chewed her out for being late, even though he *knew* that she had to get the kid to school and wouldn't adjust her schedule to account for that.

Samantha looked into the mirror to see how bad it looked. It looked pretty bad. The bags under her eyes weren't just swollen, but dark, and her hair was a nightmare. She was only 25, but she looked at least a decade older.

Emmet now had a schedule of screaming loudly every night at 2AM, and wouldn't calm down until being held for an hour. Dylan wouldn't have stood for it if he were still around. He might have hit the child. She hated to admit it, but there were times when she was tempted.

Downstairs, Samantha heard something glass break, and for the first time this morning, her eyes widened.

""Shit!"" she shouted, running out her bedroom door and sprinting down the hall, ""Shit! Shit! Shit!""

She rounded the corner to the kitchen and saw Cassie standing on a floor covered in a broken glass bowl, a mess of spilled breakfast cereal, and a jug of milk that was still spilling its contents onto the tiles.

Before Samantha could even take in the entire situation, Cassie, avoiding looking her in the eye, quickly spoke up, ""I didn't do it!""

Samantha sighed, ""Damn it, Cassie...""

""I didn't do it!"" the child squealed in a high pitch that made Samantha want to cover her ears.

""Fine,"" Samantha said, reaching down to pick up the now half-empty jug of milk and setting it on the table, ""just don't move. I need to get a broom to sweep this up. Don't move, okay?""

Samantha ran over to the closet to get the broom, dustpan, and a roll of paper towels, and walked back into the kitchen only to see Cassie gone, and in her place, a trail of tiny red footprints leading off the other direction.

""Cassie!"" Samantha screamed, seeing the tracks and realizing they were blood, and running to follow them. She slid on the milk and nearly fell, herself, but regained her balance and followed the blood... across the carpet, she couldn't help but notice... to the bathroom. The door was shut, and when she reached for the handle, she found it locked.

""Cassie!"" Samantha screamed, banging on the door.

""Not now, mommy!"" Cassie shouted, clearly upset, ""I'm in the bathroom!""

""Cassie! Open this door!"" Samantha screamed angrily.

""No! I'm in the bathroom, mommy!"" Cassie said in that defiant tone of hers. Elsewhere, she could hear Emmet, awoken by all the noise, beginning to cry out.

""Cassie,"" Samantha said in thinly-veiled tones of anger, ""you open this door *right now*.""

""Just a minute, mommy!"" Cassie said, and Samantha could hear the toilet flush and the sink turn on.

""Cassie..."" Samantha said through gritted teeth.

A moment later, the door was opened, and Cassie stood there looking pleased with herself.

""I'm done now, mommy!"" she declared.

""Come here, *now*!"" Samantha reached down and grabbed Cassie by the wrist, nearly pulling her off the ground as she pulled her over to a chair.

cvx9uar,0,t1_cvx88pw,CaspianX2,"""Rugged individualism"" was a phrase coined by Herbert Hoover to explain why America should do nothing to help people during the Great Depression. It was as unconvincing then as it is now.

The romanticized view of early Americans as people who neither wanted nor needed government assistance is ridiculous. During George Washington's time in office, the United States Post Office was established. Couldn't people have pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps and arranged their own ways to deliver mail? Clearly, a government establishing such an office believes that the government should be in service to its citizenry's needs, and not simply refraining from getting in their way. In fact, the Declaration of Independence indicates as much:

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

> **That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men**

Modern readings of the declaration often trail off after ""Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness"", but the next line is just as important. It points to a government's role to *secure* these rights, not just refrain from interfering with them. And as welfare helps to secure our right to the pursuit of happiness, so too did the post office. Without a post office, this right would be severely limited, as would anyone stuck in poverty with no meaningful way to lift themselves out of it.

So no, America did *not* have ""rugged individualism roots"". Not when it was founded, not when the phrase was coined, and not today.",-1,0,1444679241,1444717095
