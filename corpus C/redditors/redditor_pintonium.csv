Thats just not true. Wal-mart is not some unbreakable entity, anymore so than IBM was in the early part of the century or Microsoft in the 90's. Times change, and people's preferences have a massive impact on that.

I think you are over-valuing statistics. They follow theories, but they are still a description of the current status. The value of those theories goes out the window when you change the base assumptions that the statistics are measuring - because humans react to those basics; they arent a slave to them.

>one of social issues may be that smaller countries can exemplify those theories easier due simply to smaller size.

Yes. One of the things missed in discussion of a lot of this stuff is Economies of scale. Specifically, that larger organizations are much more prone to mismanagement, have to deal with organization inertia (its much harder to change), and often get in their own way. Its not just all rosy having everything under one roof.

If all of these issues were so easy to fix, why havent we done it before? ",1,0,1443549285,1444717091
cviage9,0,t1_cvi5tdl,pintonium,"Economics is not well-defined in the same way that the ""hard"" sciences (like mathematics or physics). This isn't to say they aren't valuable, moreso that the potential effects and problems are theories that are in many ways untestable. More than that, it deals with humans, who have shown that they respond to different incentives and ideas in ways that in many ways hard to model - each person is unique and may respond to things in completely different or unexpected ways. Which means that even if you have a model that predicts (even correctly) how society will react to the deployment of a system initially, it cannot say how people will react to that same system 10 years from now, because people will adjust to find loopholes, ways to game the system, or how to get the most out of it.

These issues are extremely complicated. We cannot demonstrate how policies will completely effect our society, especially years into the future. For instance, one of the main issues plaguing our healthcare system today is the binding of health insurance to employment, something that was instituted back in the 40's because of wage controls. The effects are much more far reaching than the proposals would have you believe.",5,0,1443547822,1444717091
