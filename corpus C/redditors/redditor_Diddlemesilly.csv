Anyway, yes, I think that either we would have tried to stop the spread of communism in a much more agressive way or the soviets would have invaded europe. obviously in a perfect world we wouldn't need nuclear weapons, but I think they kept us from escalating with the soviets because no one wanted to end the world, and we both knew that would happen.",1,0,1443498659,1444719745
cve7tii,1,t3_3mdyc8,Diddlemesilly,"If nuclear weapons had seriously all been banned already, we probably would have already seen world war 3, and I say that because if we hadn't have had the mutual destruction type of arrangement with the soviets they probably would have tried to go a lot farther than Germany sometime during the cold war.

cve7a47,0,t1_cvd0wh6,Diddlemesilly,"I listen to Beck regularly, not because I necessarily enjoy his dooms day talks which get pretty fucking annoying, but as a christian I respect the work he does to pay to save christians from being persecuted by Isis. Anyway, BagOnuts basically knocked the nail down on why he doesn't enjoy Trump, but its not just that, we (as in supporters of the Cruz/Paul kind of candidates) just think Trump has had enough of being himself, that is a billionaire that can get away with anything, and Beck believes that by becoming president Trump will become even more of an ego-maniac and probably be responsible for starting world war 3. I won't lie though, he does say he may actually be able to help the economy because of his success in business, but I mean that would really be the only thing he could bring to the table, his foreign policy would be garbage, although I don't think we would be walked on by other countries for fear of him starting world war 3, whether or not that would be a good thing I'll leave to you to decide

edit-- when I say he'd be good for the economy, I just mean he has more knowledge of the way money flow works than if Carson or Paul were president.",2,0,1443216834,1444719745

Just kidding, I own over fifteen firearms, and guess what...they haven't killed anyone yet... Guns don't kill people, people kill people, and criminals won't give up their guns to the government like the honest citizens would. The only thing strict gun laws would do is make honest people helpless.",0,0,1443049895,1444719745
cvbxzav,1,t3_3m0yez,Diddlemesilly,"Paul's my pick. I know he isn't gonna win but as a conservative and libertarian, his views on a small federal government and term limits in congress would really help out in the future.  Congress is a joke, he knows that, he knows the people know that.  He is pro life (as a christian I am also but I understand some arguments on the matter) and is for defunding planned parenthood, I'm not saying pro life is better or worse than pro choice, but almost every other service that planned parenthood provides Paul wants to issue in at government health centers, which is a good idea. I really hope he can get his act together.
his con's are that I don't think he'd be good for the economy, but hey they've all got their problems.

I have no favorite among the democrats, here is why:

Hillary has proven time and time again that she changes her views based on what polls are showing and lets be honest, if anyone else had done the same thing with the email server, they'd be in prison. Oh and there was Benghazi. Oh and she changed her view on the keystone pipeline after receiving millions of dollars in contributions from the supporters of it.

My view on Sanders is this: He thinks promising free college (which obama did) and legalizing weed (which obama did) is enough to get him elected. This is because he knows what appeals to millennials and that's the vote he is trying to obtain, if he can actually get millennials out in the booth he may win the vote but the femi-nazi millennials are already voting for hillary so he can count them out.

Biden doesn't stand a chance in my opinion just because of his role in the Obama administration, but he is the democrat I favor most. He's a realistic down to earth guy.

Every other democrat and republican is either way to religious (as a christian I lean right but I understand the concept of seperation of church and state) or just not worth mentioning  ",1,0,1443049544,1444719745
cvbq9uh,1,t3_3m3sbr,Diddlemesilly,"When the management at the grocery store I worked at cut departments hours so they could get paid bonuses from corporate.
When we found out just what they were doing all of us that didn't need the job at the time (we were in high school) decided to all just not come anymore, when they called each of us to see where we were we said ""giving you more hours for those paid bonuses""
Looking back we should have actually contacted corporate or the union our store was attached to, but we were 16 so we were stupid",2,0,1443037849,1444719745
