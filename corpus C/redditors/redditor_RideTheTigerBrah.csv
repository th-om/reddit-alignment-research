cvx0lyg,1,t3_3ogkll,RideTheTigerBrah,"Scenario A: Mass homicide is being carried out on a daily basis in your midst, to the point of far outclassing the Holocaust in death toll. Some people against your position are calling the victims ""parasites"" and ""cancer."" 

Scenario B: There is a significant movement that will limit your ability to do what you want with your body and render you semi-autonomous if pregnant. Some of their proponents appear motivated by religious fundamentalism or misogyny like something right out of ""A Handmaiden's Tale."" 

It's not something you can easily be dispassionate about. ",46,0,1444665612,1444718004

Nothing like getting an earful about jetfuel and steel beams, the gay marriage apocalypse, or how the owner had Osama in the sights of his sniper rifle when Baboonbama told him to cancel when you're just wanting to grab a box of 9mm and go home. 

Shitheads like that do massive damage to our hobby by turning off folks who are curious about getting a firearm. ",1,0,1444539543,1444718004
