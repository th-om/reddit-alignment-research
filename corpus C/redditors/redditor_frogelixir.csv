cvu2pwp,0,t1_cvu1gci,frogelixir,"I disagree...I wasn't looking for Tom Clancy writing the series. Shit fell apart fast in FTWD and in their world, they're asking the military to do what they've never been asked to do - forego their own families to keep hostage American citizens who have done nothing wrong. All respect to you and the military guy's comments, but this is apples and oranges to known combat in the US.",7,0,1444420871,1444722587
cvu2l6g,0,t1_cvu0cex,frogelixir,"Agree. Other than zombies, I went into this season with an open mind. ""Ok, here's a new show about the zombie apocalypse. Period."" I thoroughly enjoyed it and have limited my participation in this sub because of all the people hating on it for not being a carbon copy of TWD. TWD has covered a lot of ground since it's been on. FTWD looks like it will also cover a lot, as well as take people in a new direction ie Abigail. If this show were called Zombie Takeover, I'd still be saying, ""Damn, that was a good first season. I'm sticking around.""",-1,0,1444420676,1444722587

On top of that, it would be historical recognition and acknowledgement that the party is in such disarray and shambles that they need to go outside the team to help find unity. Basically tells the world that they're a bunch of fuck ups with no hope.",1,0,1444420150,1444722587
cvtz2ks,0,t1_cvtwenv,frogelixir,"Don't forget that a lot of your ""decent chunks"" are gerrymandered districts that have been drawn in favor of the GOP. It's not at all reflective of anything more than craven obsession to maintain power at all costs. ",20,0,1444415385,1444722587
cvtw5r5,1,t3_3o30o9,frogelixir,"Here's what I don't understand, and I hope someone can address: What's stopping the government from ""renormalizing"" a hyperinflative currency? Couldn't they pin it to some arbitrary commodity and say something like: the value of $1 US dollar is now equal to a gallon of gasoline? Everyone else prices their products accordingly and you don't have people having to deal with 8-digit milk prices?",1,0,1444411077,1444722587
