cuzfkds,1,t3_3kfwsq,CallMeDrDavies,"That's a good question.. I'm not sure.  My immediate family was never that religious but their immediate family was, so I had grandparents who would put pressure me into it.  My family enrolled me in a Lutheran school for 3rd and 4th grade, but I'm not really sure why, I've never asked.  What's odd is that as I view the progression of my views on religion, that school has literally no impact it seems.  It contributed zero positive or negative bias into me (from what I can tell).  I lived in Arizona and Colorado for most of my life so I was used to big cities, but my atheism took over when I reached high school, as I moved to Nebraska.  I looked around and said I didn't want to be like them, so I ran in the other direction.  I still deal with a lot of pent up anger towards religion so I have to deal with that, but that's where it came from.  I suppose you could say it came about from a sledgehammer, then.",1,0,1442097350,1444729016
cuy2ixu,1,t3_3khn6c,CallMeDrDavies,"From what I've seen about his interview, I don't think Biden truly hinted towards a potential run. It seemed like the same old same old more than anything different.",5,0,1441989586,1444729016
currb69,0,t1_curqqwp,CallMeDrDavies,"To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what school of thought I may go into. As of now I'm mainly trying to learn all the various philosophers and their general teachings. However, to answer your latter question, I do have general philosophical outlooks, like moral objectivity, so I'll likely go into something that addresses that and can be related to my political science field.",1,0,1441480881,1444729016
curqp2p,0,t1_curqjqa,CallMeDrDavies,"No you're fine! I'm also a political science major and recently added philosophy as a second major so I'm still relatively new to the field, so I don't have all the texts and thoughts quite down yet.",2,0,1441479695,1444729016
curqgxs,0,t1_curpx6q,CallMeDrDavies,"I'm not going to pretend I remember everything, but I have read the works you're likely referring to and I have no recollection of that being put forth as a conclusion. The only thing I'm able to think of from those earlier-taught texts that's remotely close to that is that you're not responsible when coerced or otherwise doing something involuntarily, but that's obviously quite different than being a slave to your genes. I suspect your professor was either speaking through a specific author and poorly conveyed that, or was simply blowing smoke. I'll let the other, more knowledgeable individuals comment on that, but I wish I could have been of more help :p",1,0,1441479257,1444729016
curpoqq,1,t3_3jro19,CallMeDrDavies,"So first and foremost, I'd say your professor has a valid argument, but not really a sound one. Before delving too deep into the actual content of your question, though, I think a little more context may be beneficial. Could you tell us what piece of literature you guys were reading when he said this, or maybe even a specific passage, so we can get an idea of the author and maybe be able to give a better response?",1,0,1441477788,1444729016
cupkft0,0,t1_cupiotc,CallMeDrDavies,"First and foremost, for whatever reason, me trying to say ""what"" turned into ""Hagar.""

Second, I thought you were asking about a different double standard. Not why others can't do what Israel does, but why Israel can do what others can't. 

Third, I'm not providing judgement, I'm providing a reason for what I thought you were asking. It's fine to dismiss my reason, but you can hardly label this as simply anti-Israel.",3,0,1441307246,1444729016
cupexiz,0,t1_cupe63j,CallMeDrDavies,"I'm actually a philosophy major so these are things I wonder about often.  I was going to make a comment earlier about how I believe in objective morals, for example, and that kind of drives my reasoning that regardless of how people view things, there is an objective and correct conclusion that one can come to.  That's part of what played into me saying that about economics, but I greatly appreciate you helping me out here.

Side note though, I'd argue it's not more difficult to prove people wrong in philosophy than other areas because the arguments have to be logic-based to even be considered valid, let alone correct.  You could equate philosophy's logic to the methodology used by other social sciences, but even then I would say logic is more intuitive.",1,0,1441298850,1444729016
cupdxvt,0,t1_cup1y1m,CallMeDrDavies,"If you can stay with me here, I promise I'm not trying to troll or anything like that, but truly understand what it is you're saying and compare to what I had in mind.  Correct me as necessary.

The way I've looked at it is that while certain ideological economists come to certain conclusions consistent with the way they view things, that doesn't exactly mean they're correct in their conclusion.  I can come to an economic conclusion while entirely avoiding a law of economics, so I guess what I'm saying/asking is that if you were to take all the different theories about economics and account for their deficiencies accurately, you would come to a conclusion.  

I suppose, all in all, I'm saying that to come to different conclusions means one side is ignoring something that the other side has accounted for (or perhaps both are ignoring).  You made very valid points about how you can't perform experiments, so I assume that's the downfall to my argument.",1,0,1441297344,1444729016
