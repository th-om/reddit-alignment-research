You didn't mention a single downside of the LP despite there being plenty of them (ergonomics, fragile headstock, higher price, erratic QA, etc).  Plus you made some outright false claims, like that the LP has a greater tonal variety than the Strat. ",4,0,1444666119,1444721211

cvruzre,0,t1_cvrntbp,GymIn26Minutes,"Economics is inexorably entwined with politics and morality.  It is at its core a study of human behavior, and attempting to ignore the connection as an act of futility and laziness.   Economics isn't the study of revenue maximization like you seem to think it is.  Nor does the economy exist in a vacuum outside of it's impact on the actors which make up the economy.

Any attempt at optimizing for a particular aspect of the market is inherently normative.  You cannot optimize for every aspect of the economy simultaneously, so policy focusing solely on one aspect of the economy (gdp growth, or efficiency, for example) may result in negative side effects in other economic aspects (say, inflation or employment).  So any economic recommendations have to be looked at in the context of their potential side effects.

The reason I grew tired of your responses is precisely because you did *not* respond to my points, you just dogmatically recited that more liquidity is always better.  This is the same sort of sophomoric single variable interpretation of the economy I see from the teenage libertarians that are so vocal on reddit.

I am not dead set against HFT, but it is worth discussing whether the benefits of HFT (smaller spread, for example) outweigh the downsides (increased volatility, for example).  More specifically, which HFT strategies are okay (like market making) and which are detrimental (like front running). Yet you refuse to even entertain the idea that there might be HFT strategies that are problematic.",-1,0,1444259261,1444721211
