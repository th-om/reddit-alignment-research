cvqn78o,0,t1_cvqlek0,BraveSquirrel,"That is exactly the problem I've found with taking time off and then trying to get back into it.  I've heard that muscles get stronger faster than ligaments and tendons do, so you have a tendency to pull/tear stuff if you try to get back into it as quickly as possible.  

After injuring myself like 3 different times when I went from a slack time to an intense time I've learned that I have to pace myself now when I start getting back in shape.  Even though I can feel I can do higher weights I'll purposely hold off from moving up for weeks and just focus on perfect form during that time, giving my tendons and ligaments time to catch up to my muscles in terms of what they can bare.  

That is an interesting thought though, it might be very efficient as long as you're careful about the way you do it.",3,0,1444171429,1444730094
