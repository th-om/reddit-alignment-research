Do you not know what a gift is? It's something given freely with strings attached. Whether he contributes to anything or not is completely irrelevant, if you receive a gift, it is yours to do with as you please. If the sender of the gift wishes to have said gift back, they must ask you or else it's theft. What part of that are you not understanding? You keep trying to ignore what a gift is.

And what is with your weird fixation on me? I'm talking about OP and you keep trying to drag me into this fantasy world you have. To answer your question, no. It does not sound familiar. I'm not in college and I bought my own desktop with my own money.",1,0,1444694720,1444724616

cvxhvo0,0,t1_cvxfcth,MomochiKing,"When did morals come into this?

To answer the question though, children don't think ahead. They don't think of the impact that their decisions have in the long term. Children want instant gratification and they want it now. Morally speaking, there are no morals. That's why it takes an adult with a grasp on the long-term to make decisions.

As for why rape is immoral, it's forcing yourself onto another person, imposing your will on theirs. If you don't know why that's immoral, I don't have the expertise to explain it. As a side-note, rape is also illegal, so there's a pragmatic reason not to do it.",1,1,1444691285,1444724616

The lack of suffering ties in with consent. If somebody is suffering it's usually against their will, rarely do people chose to endure pain when they would rather not, BDSM community aside.",1,1,1444686150,1444724616
