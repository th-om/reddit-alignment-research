cvxmk1t,0,t1_cvxl7x2,linkns86,"> Eh? I mean I have private health subsidized through my work, and at 24 wih no pre existing conditions/smoking/drinking or family history, I pay ~$98 a month. In comparison the Gold level plans under Obamacare would cost me about $18 a month. And this is in a state without medicaid expansion, at the same level of taxes I'm paying now.

That's really unlikely- but it will depend on your state and income.  I'm 29, healthy and don't have insurance through work.  I pay $118 a month for catastrophic insurance on the exchange.  I only make about 35,000 a year.  Gold would put me near the 150 mark.

cvxkbhx,0,t1_cvxj0xn,linkns86,"Not quite.  The difference between private insurance and a single payer system is that private insurance doesn't pull *everyone* into the same pot.  For instance, if you are a non-smoker and have a very healthy life style you might get health insurance from a company that only caters to people with similar life styles.  You would pay less because you are low risk and the insurance would be exclusive so you're not paying more for the unhealthy, high risk behavior of others.

The other side is that people who are sick through no fault of their own might end up paying more for private insurance or healthcare.

> If you wanted to buy a domestically-made fridge, that's actually pretty comparable, so it's not really cheaper at all for the same thing... No, you can't buy a domestically made fridge for $400 dollars.

I'm unclear on why you think that is an issue.  The purpose of the fridge example is to show that purchasing power has increased for Americans, which it obviously has.  If you're trying to make a related point about domestically made products you might have to spell it out more clearly.  I'm not trying to be obtuse, I just think we might be talking passed each other in that case.  

>You can buy an imported piece of shit for that much, but it won't last 50 years

I think you are over estimating the reliability of older products.  Generally, as technology becomes better things become more efficient.  And even if the new fridge only lasts 20 years and old one lasts 50, you could buy 6.5 of the new ones at the same cost as the 1950s fridge and get over 100 years of use compared to 50.  Adjust that for the amount you'd safe on power over the same span of time and we are probably talking magnitudes of superiority. 


>Using the price of imported goods in an effort to justify your claim that wages haven't stayed stagnant and that people are financially secure is completely misleading.

Well, that was never really my claim.  My claim was that our purchasing power has increased over time, which this supports.  I'm generally unclear on how people want to define wage stagnation and financially security.  They can be slippery terms.

  In the 1950's a refrigerator cost $329.00.  That's $3,253.36 in today's dollars.  Today you can get a refrigtor for less than a sixth of that, and it also happens to be superior in every aspect.

That is just one examples of the purchasing power increasing.  

>I tried to find valid info for you, but in my cursory searching all I can find comes from a combination of sources. Unfortunately, unless I'm going to write a paper of my own on it, it's a lot more work than I've got time for today. 

I understand.  This isn't our job or anything.  I think it is reasonable to assume that since the price of raw materials has gone down, the cost of a house has gone down as well (especially adjusted for the increased quality of modern homes).  

>I don't think anyone is saying that healthcare isn't a worthwhile expenditure. What they're saying is that our hobbled together system of private pay insurance companies is just a crappy version of single payer, with profit as a primary motive. It doesn't justify its existence next to the single payer systems that other first-world countries have.

I wrote about the problems of single payer systems and price-signaling earlier.  I think some of the statistics out there are misleading because no one in the US actually *knows* how much any medical procedure costs.  Consequentially, hospitals bill high and negotiate lower.  The high bills shouldn't be taken as the actual cost of healthcare.

>Higher education. Not public schools.

As a student with a ton of debt, this is something I've looked into a lot.  The bottom line is that the federal government backs student loans and consequently they are given out like candy (for what else can you get a 35,000 dollar loan with no colateral or credit history?).  Colleges see this as an endless supply of money and raise their rates accordingly, since they know students can get the loan money.

It doesn't dismiss this. It talks about it and what it means.

It does take these into account.

A 9 year span is not 'cherry picking'.  You could include the 2008 recession.  It's not going to change the general trend.

Why does that matter?  For most people, they are still *paying* for the services.  

>They will be FREE at the point of use, like roads, which, for all practical purposes in discussions about single payer healthcare, is what people understand ""free"" to mean. 

See, this is why you are confusing me.  First, you say I'm being misleading by bringing up when things are being paid for.  Then you say they are 'free' because they are paid for before point of use.  

Does *when* we pay for things matter or doesn't it?  In either case, as long as we *are* in fact giving our money for some service it is not free.  Calling it that is misleading.
