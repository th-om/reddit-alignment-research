cvxqfnn,0,t1_cvxq9j1,Dynosmite,"I did it for a year. It's basically working remotely while traveling on tourist or student visas. In thailand, you can stay for six months on a student visa if you take only a couple hours of thai language courses a week. 3 months on a regular visa. You then have to travel to Cambodia or somewhere outside the country for a little bit to ""reset"" your visa time. This is the basic principle, stay in a cheap place until your tourist visa runs out, leave, come back repeat. I had a circuit of about 5 cities and did a lot of traveling. You basically just have to make sure you have reliable internet access and do major traveling in between projects or on weekends.",3,0,1444704767,1444719749

It's basically travelling permanently in cheap places like Thailand and SE Asia while freelancing or running your own digital products company. There's a lot of programming freelance work out there and cities in Thailand, like Chiang Mai, cost less that 400 USD per month to live in. r/digitalnomad r/freelance",4,0,1444704334,1444719749
