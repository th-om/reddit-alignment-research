cvkffmi,0,t1_cvk6uif,hallam81,"I think a second issue with the consensus argument is that people extend their ""findings"" past where the scientific community actually agree. I would agree that the scientific community agrees that CC is real and is made by human activity. This doesn't establish which people for CC policies reach for. Such things as, it is ""bad for everyone"", ""that the US government has to spend trillions of dollars to fix it,"" or ""that we are all going to die if we don't somehow completely change the behavior of every human on the planet.""

If an argument uses data, then you can only go as far as that data will let you. If you argue from authority, people will eventually misuse that power of persuasion and ask for more because there are no limitations to the authority argument.  ",1,0,1443704613,1444724880

cv2sago,1,t3_3l2sze,hallam81,"I think the first issue here is what exactly is being considered sin and what is being ""atoned"" for. For example, yes something like adultery is a sin but it is a sin because it is a known activity that is cutting that person off from God. To me, theology is stating that the adulterer is not being punished eternally because they had sex with someone they were not married to. They are being punished because they committed adultery and that adultery cut them off from God. The separation from God is temporary but forgiveness is not mandatory. If the adulterer chooses to not atone for their separation then God is happy to let the decisions stand making that sin ""infinite"" as well. The same would be true for lying, theft, idolatry, and other sins. Some activities will always cut you off. However, some activities could cut you off before, but as we grow as a species and learn in our faith, may not be sins any longer. Stuff like eating meat on Friday.  

Punishment, though historically accurate to the lexicon, is the wrong word IMO. Sins don't cause you to be ""punished."" Sin causes us to distance ourselves from our creator. As those distances add up, we need something to help bridge the gap. For Christianity, Jesus and the saints are those bridges which guide us back and show us why forgiveness is important and needed.

cv2a9ql,1,t3_3kyzyn,hallam81,"While I don't know if it is permanent or not (or if it is unpleasant), I do believe that God will allow you to be separated from him if you choose it. I would think that the highly religious would find this to be exceptionally unpleasant but it may not be of much concern for those who are already separated and like that separation.

This doesn't mean I support either; but I am okay with its use in these situations.  State agents can't use civil disobedience because it is an abuse of power and could easily devolve into corruption. I think there is a line and the state agent that uses ""civil disobedience"" crosses that line.  ",1,0,1441372464,1444724880
