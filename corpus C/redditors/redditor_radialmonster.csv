He refused to do that as he doesn't think it's a Centurylink / Qwest issue since I get max speed tests from other sites.",1,0,1443724132,1444728730
cvkrtps,0,t1_cvkqhty,radialmonster,"Thanks so much for the info, I haven't seen it go through cogentco in any of my tracerts.  I have business DSL from them at my own location, but this isn't just about my own location, it's affecting my customers that also use Centurylink as their ISP.   If yours was going through level3 I'd be willing to offer some cash to call your contact and see what up aha.
