The Tallahassee Museum has a fairly new zip line course that gets rave reviews, plus some cool animals, though nowhere near as many as a big city zoo.",6,0,1442296331,1444726708

cuhkx7a,0,t1_cuhi65g,reakt80,"You're totally right, in the context of Sinatra's arrangements; a big band with complex harmony is pretty common in his records. I think of his sense of melody as simple, and the scalability of his songs. You can take a Sinatra tune, give it to a pianist and a singer, and still get the essence of the song. An average listener can follow the vocal melody relatively easily.  

Skrillex's music is complex in my mind because of the rhythm, the production, and the startling momentum shifts. If you want to follow one of his songs, it's an active process that requires a lot of attention and rhythmic sophistication. It's also not really scalable in the same way; It would be quite a feat for piano and vocals, or guitar and vocals, to really capture the essence of his music. The medium of EDM is a huge part of what makes it what it is.",5,0,1440691940,1444726708
cuhbw80,1,t3_3iktpy,reakt80,"Sinatra enjoyed a long, successful career in a music industry that was nowhere near as crowded as it is now. He won an academy award. He hung out with president Kennedy. His music was simple and broadly appealing. He won 11 Grammy awards and was presented the presidential medal of freedom and a congressional gold medal.  

Skrillex is a genre-pushing artist in a genre without broad cross-generational appeal. His music is complex, aggressive, and highly stylized. He'll be remembered on a far smaller scale with a much larger list of other artists. The kind of household name status enjoyed by Sinatra is going to be incredibly hard for anyone to achieve in the current climate of the music industry. ",6,0,1440674362,1444726708

Now it's just a bunch of wal mart photo studio rejects clicking a shutter and delivering utter garbage. ",3,0,1440417598,1444726708
