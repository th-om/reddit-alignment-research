cvxq9it,0,t1_cvxhfnu,Drayzen,I don't care why touch wiz exists. It's bad. In fact the general consensus is that touchwiz is one of the worst android skins. ,1,0,1444704485,1444721601

Good day.",-3,0,1444685963,1444721601

cvxd8es,0,t1_cvxd4ck,Drayzen,"Oh yeah? That's why the majority of the United States that buys flagship devices buy Apple, right?

PS: Don't be ignroant btw. That article was dropped like 7 months after the iPhone 6 went on sale, and 18 days after the Galaxy S6 went on sale.

It's going to show bias because of the splurge of new handset purchases. ",-4,0,1444684032,1444721601
cvxd583,0,t1_cvx783x,Drayzen,"You can't root on any of the MAJOR carriers in the US and Canada. TMobile let you, and I think Sprint did as well. 

It's just another reason why the S6 and it's family devices are trash. ",0,0,1444683904,1444721601
cvxd3af,0,t1_cvx6niy,Drayzen,I think Touchwiz is the biggest piece of trash in the history of OEM skins and Samsung developers have no fucking clue how to make a resilient and lightweight platform. ,-3,0,1444683824,1444721601
cvxd257,0,t1_cvx9fbm,Drayzen,"You went full stupid, just so you know.

Things like ""Shattered screens"" dont matter to me, because I don't drop my devices. I've owned like 10 smartphones and never shattered any of them. 

My radio is fine. I have 3/5 right now on my iPhone. I have 3/5 on my Galaxy S6 right now too. 

And no, I don't have to admit anything. Right now Samsung is the lead OEM for Android so they represent Android as a feature. While I appreciate myself some stock Android, as I stated there are always drawbacks when picking Android. You either deal with decent build quality by picking an OEM with trash updates, or you get fast updates and lackluster build. 

I have an iPhone, it has already received an update, and I have Beta 9.1 on the device. I also get an amazingly built device out of premium components.

Not really sure what the problem is. Maybe it's subjective? Maybe you got some hate for Apple for some reason. 

I don't hate Android. I hate what OEM's have done to Android and what Google refuses to do to position Android as a superior platform. ",2,0,1444683778,1444721601
