cvsxudo,0,t1_cvsxikz,fungiside,"I agree in the current climate not much would happen, but I guess my disconnect is that they are elected to determine the governments next steps.  If those next steps are making the government smaller, then they should be enacting legislation to do so by cutting programs.  If they have to capitulate in some regards to get advances in others, I don't see that as a problem.

It seems like many of the conservatives here view any sort of compromise as a loss, so not compromising has turned into a win...  but nothing is happening.  We're not supporting soldiers.  We're not actually lowering taxes.  We just stagnate, but somehow that's a win...  seems off to me.

Edit:  I'm getting some downvotes.  I'm sorry for being a RINO.",20,0,1444338082,1444719074
