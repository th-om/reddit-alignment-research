I wouldn't want an economist to design my town's bridge any time soon. Mathematics is the language concepts are communicated in. Just because I can understand English, doesn't mean I could automatically understand, for example, complex philosophy texts.",2,0,1444399159,1444716474

He has dedicated his life to studying physics. Do you understand how complex and difficult economics and policy decision-making can get? Would you take a lesson on particle physics from Milton Friedman?",1,0,1444395823,1444716474
cvtmpb9,0,t1_cvtjcld,-45,"Yeah man that last bit. People always love an appeal to authority. I wouldn't take lessons in particle physics from Milton Friedman, why should Hawking or Bill freakin' Nye be relevant to any economic policy?

With that said, the OP has twisted the words of Hawking anyway. Hawking never mentioned capitalism.",1,0,1444395631,1444716474

I know it sounds like a good concept to begin with, but with even some basic economic analysis you'll quickly discover that it's not only unsustainable, but downright destructive. It is not creating wealth. It is destroying it.",0,0,1444395286,1444716474
cvtmghb,0,t1_cvtl70g,-45,"Everyone's talking about automation as some dystopian thing of the future, without considering the possibility that it could decrease the amount of time we spend working. People forget that people used to work basically all day, 12+ hours slaving away until innovators like Henry Ford, with the efficiency of the assembly line, cut down working hours to the 8 hour days we now know. 

People are already experimenting with the 4 day work week. We should embrace automation, not fear it.",2,0,1444395098,1444716474

It's an appeal to authority. If Einstein, the Pope and Stephen Hawking are all ignorant on the subject of Economics, then one shouldn't automatically weight their opinions as more significant or true.",1,0,1444394832,1444716474
cvtkdi3,0,t1_cvt74kr,-45,"You just made a huge assertion. Care to elaborate? I do private math tutoring. I compete with all the other math tutors in the area. We advertise ourselves and our product by advertisement and word of mouth. Is that not a free-market? On a larger scale, are ride-sharing apps like Uber/Lyft not a free market? Is the exchanges of crypto-currency like Bitcoin not a freemarket? Where is this obligatory regulation you assert must exist?",1,0,1444389015,1444716474
cvtk40v,0,t1_cvtefki,-45,"Both the terms socialism AND capitalism have been distorted by bipartisan politics, which is a real shame, because they refer to who owns the means of production, nothing more. Both sides have good intentions - most people agree that they would like to see poverty decreased and living standards increased. With that said however, I still believe that it can easily be shown that private ownership has proven itself more successful throughout history.

""Why do you think you would need those things"", you say, typed up on your expensive personal computer or smartphone that was the direct product of decades of market competition. It is not some abstract concept that free-market capitalism has raised living standards and lowered poverty worldwide over the past century. What is incentivizing individuals to innovate if not the prospect of accessing a higher quality of life for themselves and their family? 

""For the greater good"" or ""for the progress of society/humanity"" won't hold up in the long term - rational actors take risks because they see a potential benefit mainly to themselves and their loved ones. This isn't a zero-sum game. The people working in a factory, for example, are paid less than the value they generate, because that discrepancy represents the return the entrepreneur has earned for taking a risk, creating a job and providing the start up capital of the business. That is the capitalists' equivalent of a wage.

Even if you could show that innovation could still exist in the absence of private ownership, I have a hard time believing it could rival that of the ridiculous technological progress made in the past century. I think your outlook is a bit myopic, and you lack creativity, like the people who said ""who could ever need more than 256MB of data"" in the 90s. Things can always be improved, can you imagine if people had said ""well what more could we possible need"" in the 1930s?",0,0,1444387998,1444716474
