cvu98se,0,t1_cvu9077,TelescopeFeed,"How can an absurd comparison be relevant?  All things being equal--two equally qualified candidates--with the only difference being political persuasion, I would simply argue that in the privacy of the ballot box a woman's desire for equality could very well trump her choice between the lesser of two evils.  To suggest otherwise is to pretend every woman who votes is so hyper-politicized that the alternative is out of the question.  I'd say for those of us who spend time talking politics in internet forums, it's probably a good reminder to point out that we are the opinionated oddballs, not the disengaged masses.

cvu907b,0,t1_cvu8jax,TelescopeFeed,"Of course.  But again, it's not a negative change, change being the other operative word here.  Another way of looking at it is a vote for Hillary is, at worst, more of the same for a conservative woman.  A vote for Fiorina will result in the loss of the right to choose for liberal women.  So the choice each faces is not equivalent.",-2,0,1444431217,1444723666

cvu70qb,0,t1_cvu6sss,TelescopeFeed,"That's not what I'm suggesting.  On the one hand, voting for the other results in no direct negative change (a conservative woman voting for Hillary).  On the other, voting for the other results in a direct loss of a very specific and narrow right (a pro-choice woman (liberal) would have to sacrifice her right to choose in order to vote for Fiorina).

cvu5y10,0,t1_cvu58dj,TelescopeFeed,"Well, ""hate"" is a strong word.  I see a lot of men hating liberal politics, but I don't see a lot of women hating.  In fact, the few who do hate as good as the men are so rare they're novelties.  ",-3,0,1444425937,1444723666
