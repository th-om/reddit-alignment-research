cv23v9h,1,t3_3kz2lr,unphilievable,"I believe Bernie plans to levy a tax on stock market trades, at .5%, to fund free public college tuition for those who qualify. The tax is small enough to not discourage investment on Wall Street, while still providing a good amount of new revenue to the Feds. 
Additionally, a very small tax on trades should discourage unnecessarily risky ventures that have a low likelihood of doing much good and stand to lead to new crashes in the future.",0,0,1442299845,1444728850
cv23qtw,1,t3_3l06x0,unphilievable,"The Economist and Al Jazeera are good examples of modern journalism. I also read the Kiplinger Letter. No analysis or opinions whatsoever, it's written for managers to let them know what's happening and why and how to respond. Makes for a solid, barebones summary of current events in politics and economics",3,0,1442299393,1444728850

cuzpwmd,1,t3_3kqw8p,unphilievable,"Well, technically the USA was only directly threatened by one of the Axis powers, and even that was mostly due to our political and economic actions against Japanese expansion far away from the states. For the last war fought for American freedom against a serious invasion, look a bit earlier to 1812.
Not that WWII intervention wasn't justified. Nazis, Fascists, and Japanese militarists can probably be considered... ehh... ""bad.""",3,0,1442117728,1444728850
