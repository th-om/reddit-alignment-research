cvuzgu7,0,t1_cvtihm2,Mr_Subtlety,"Well, like I said, it's quite common when any immigration occurs that some conflict arises. I'm not super familiar with the internal politics in Sweden, so I don't know precisely what obstacles there in particular are keeping young people from having more children, but it's definitely happening all across Europe and it doesn't seem to be abetting. I strongly doubt that even in a great economy, middle class couples are going to start bringing the average number of children above 3, which is what they'd need to do to keep the population growing fast enough for the economy. 

But claims that the bloodline is going to die our or the culture disappear -- that seems needlessly alarmist to me. There's nearly 10,000,000 people in Sweden, and of those, less than a million were  born outside the EU. So it's not exactly like Swedes are an endangered species, or they're in any danger of being dominated by a colonial-style invasion. Instead, they just have to deal with a number of people in their country with a different cultural background. 

Living in the US, I can well understand how it can create friction when you put different cultural groups together. As I said in my original response, it's quite a common thing to see whenever there are mass migrations of people. But this is hardly the first time in history it's happened. People survive, they incorporate new people and ultimately benefit from having newcomers with new perspectives. The culture shifts a little, but then, culture always shifts. As annoying as that might be to older people --and I understand, and sympathize with their annoyance -- it's just a fact of life. Newcomers or no, cultures shift over time and some people end up feeling alienated, especially as they get older. Fighting against it is a sure way to end up angry.

And yes, of course I can imagine problems in the short term -- I've been talking about them from the start. This particular thread is about racism, though, so it struck me as a worthwhile thing to focus on. ",1,0,1444501386,1444722511
cvsu8cj,0,t1_cvsncld,Mr_Subtlety,"Well, if you want a narrow answer to your question of whether Sweden (or anywhere) is morally obligated to allow immigrants from other races in, I don't know that there really is an answer. Sweden, like any country, can do what it wants. But allowing immigration has significant advantages, not the least of which being that Europe's rapidly aging, slowly growing native-born population is going to be faced with some serious economic perils if they don't get a little new blood. Besides, the idea that they can simply tune out the world's other cultures and races and remain homogeneous is probably impractical and unattainable in an increasingly connected planet. So yes, they *could* solve this problem just by cutting off foreigners, and the wave of hate would probably abate somewhat. But they'd be inviting a whole raft of further problems that might be much more serious and difficult to solve than simply admitting they're a little racist and working on being better.

cvrhq4j,0,t1_cvrcq6f,Mr_Subtlety,"I think the shift is an entirely predictable one; it's easy to be tolerant of other people in *theory*, when they're far away from you. When they actually come and settle nearby, it's not so easy to ignore the differences in background and culture, *especially* when there's some obvious visual distinction that allows people to categorize and ""other"" the newcomers. This same scenario played out in the [Great Migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American)) of the first half of the 1900's, when African-Americans moved out of the racist South into more racially liberal, more sympathetic North. Or so they thought -- when they got there, they found the North was just as bad, and in some ways even worse. The North talked a good game, but when they actually had to deal with large numbers of incoming other races, they panicked and freaked out, just like Europe is doing now.

Of course, just because this is a natural part of the reactionary process doesn't mean it's an inevitable constant state. Americans did the same thing with Chinese, European, Jewish, Irish, and recently Latino immigrants. But after years of virulent racist panic, they eventually mellowed out and brought the hysteria down to at least a more workable level. Obviously, it *can* happen, and it's crucial that we facilitate it happening. The problem with Sweden is that it's not even acknowledging the problem; without admitting it's a problem, finding that solution is going to be much harder. Sweden (and really, Europe in general) has had the luxury of neglecting their  race issues, while America has been (painfully and slowly) confronting theirs. Now, Europe can't afford to do that anymore; it's time they stopped pretending this is something they're immune to simply because they didn't have such a long tradition of Slavery.",3,0,1444239326,1444722511
cvqc1bj,1,t3_3npca0,Mr_Subtlety,Seems like there's just too little evidence to really make any kind of determination. What little tiny amount of evidence there ever was has been thoroughly eradicated by relentless press sensationalism. Any theories would be almost completely baseless speculation.,3,0,1444154638,1444722511
cvlw9af,0,t1_cvlnxri,Mr_Subtlety,"Well, no one is saying it's a normal thing to do. But then again, Jackson was a really weird guy, living in his own private ultra-rich universe. That makes it quite a bit harder to extrapolate his intentions in doing so. It's definitely socially inappropriate behavior but in the case of a guy who does so many socially inappropriate things, it's hardly a smoking gun.

cvjj6ua,0,t1_cvjidku,Mr_Subtlety,"Well, Oakland is where much of the money from Detroit moved after the riots, including quite a bit of their industry. Had more to do with racial anxiety than economic factors; despite the UAW, manufacturing (the big three and, crucially, their related independent suppliers) were still riding pretty high at that time. It's no surprise that when the money (and a huge chunk of the population) drained out of Detroit, surrounding areas prospered while the city declined.",1,0,1443635836,1444722511
