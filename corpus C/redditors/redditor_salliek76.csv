cvwn3p5,0,t1_cvvsumq,salliek76,"That's an unfortunate side effect of Title IX, which requires equal opportunity for men's and women's varsity programs.  The problem is that football alone fields so many players that you could not have *any* other men's teams and still have a hard time satisfying the requirement.  

When I was a student (20+ years ago), they added a women's softball program, women's bowling, and women's badminton, plus they already had women's gymnastics and volleyball and some others I probably didn't know about, *just* to counterbalance the size of the inherently male-only programs (football and baseball).  It sucks because if a guy doesn't play one of the big three sports (football, baseball, or basketball, and I'll include track here too because a ton of football players run track), odds are that their sport of choice is going to be club level instead of varsity.  

Incidentally, a lot of people in the women's sports world are lobbying to have competitive cheerleading included as a varsity sport (mostly women, sometimes 40+ on a team), which would be a good way to get more men's slots to open up for other sports.

Sorry for the long answer; didn't mean to write that much!  The vast majority of women athletes are all for their and other sports being opened up to as many as possible, so we hate to see men's programs closed or kept at club level as much as anybody.  Unfortunately you're up against a wall when you've reached your quotas for Title IX purposes, so your best bet is to lobby on behalf of women's teams just as hard as you lobby for men's.",3,0,1444626449,1444720940
cvw1u88,0,t1_cvvxk40,salliek76,"I was always taught that strength/flexibility training can help prevent knee injuries of the type that come with planting/cutting/pushing off, but ones like Chubb's (due to contact) are more or less unavoidable.  Do you know off the top of your head which category Georgia's other knee injuries tend to fall under?  (I can't stomach googling them to find out for myself.)

Disclaimers: (1) I don't think I read the post last year that you're talking about and (2) I'm a woman, so the nature of knee injuries is a little different for us due to differences in hip/knee anatomy.",2,0,1444589198,1444720940
cvvgtd7,0,t1_cvv9jht,salliek76,"Bahaha, this sort of did happen in a way.  If you were watching on TV, you would have heard Gary Danielson mistakenly say that the Georgia penalty at :06 resulted in a ten-second runoff, meaning the game would have been over.  Then the referee announced that the runoff didn't apply because the clock was already stopped, so the game was un-over.

This was especially brilliant because (1) it was a too-many-men penalty (note my flair) and (2) the runoff rule exists specifically because of UNC benefiting unfairly from an offensive penalty in the Music City Bowl...against Tennessee--the second time *in the same season* that UT lost a game after leading with no time on the clock.

cvv31gi,0,t1_cvuzb9s,salliek76,"> Gate already open? Shut the fucking gate anyway.

NOOOOO!  Leave the gate exactly how you found it!  People used to do this all the time on our farm, and it would result in a pasture full of cows cut off from their only source of drinking water, mothers separated from calves, and other pain-in-the-ass, sometimes dangerous situations for the animals. (They move around during the day for any number of reasons.)

Unless you are one million percent *certain* what you're doing is helpful, things on a farm should be left the way they're found, even if it seems unintuitive or inconsequential.  If a hose is running, leave it running.  If a light is on, leave it on.  If a piece of equipment is parked in a certain spot, leave it there.  

Yes, it's a pain to have to round up loose animals, but it's just as much of a pain to fix a fence that a cow busted through because she couldn't get to her calf.",2,0,1444507994,1444720940

cvtnxjr,0,t1_cvtnlrj,salliek76,"Yeah, that's kind of what I was getting at.  It seems like having a straight-sized model covers a multitude of sins when it comes to fitting and other questions.  I'm saying this as someone who has made clothes for myself everywhere from a size 4 to a size 22: it's a helluva lot easier to half-ass it on fit when your figure can serve as another feature of the design itself.  

It's no different from having a lingerie contest where one of the models is twiggy and the rest of them are model-curvy glamazon women; you can say what you want about ""looking past"" all that and just focusing on the design, but they're just not going to be comparable on the runway.",15,0,1444398114,1444720940
cvtnq5l,0,t1_cvtnhso,salliek76,"Yeah, you've got a point.  I hesitate to say that they shouldn't have used any plus-sized models, since that's not the point of fashion either, so I don't really know what I'm asking for, LOL.  

I'll add that I really relate to Ashley and have been pulling so hard for her throughout this season.  I first taught myself to sew many years ago because I was too big to wear any of the cute stuff that was in style, and I can definitely see shades of that in Ashley's designs.  Obviously I'm nowhere near as talented as she is, but it seems to me like her design ideas are more based on making plus-sized versions of current trends, rather than innovating styles herself.  On the other hand, plus-sized trendy *is* innovative, so I can't entirely hold that against her.",3,0,1444397720,1444720940

Aside from the obvious danger they can pose to humans (even if they're not set up in somebody's yard!), they seem awfully inhumane to me.  I grew up in the country and I can understand the need to control nuisance animals, especially large ones like bears, but I just hate the idea of doing it in such a way that the animal will suffer needlessly.
