While I agree that ""being an official of a republic is more complicated than that"", and you have to sometimes go against popular opinion to do what's right for the country, in an election you often need to do the opposite, or you won't end up being an elected official at all.",6,0,1444314012,1444722753

I don't know what ""Survey Monkey"" is, but they fail to even show up on 538's rankings of pollsters -- and there are some *real* dogs on that list (but no, uh...monkeys).

As I said, wait for a REAL poll.",2,0,1439150177,1444722753

It's not on the NBC website.

Go Google for this poll, and you will find that the only links run in a circle of right wing news sites all referring to each other's stories - without citing the actual poll.

And if it actually exists, why wouldn't you just link to it, instead of Brietbart?

Brietbart is crap.

Wait for the results from a credible source.",1,0,1439148781,1444722753
