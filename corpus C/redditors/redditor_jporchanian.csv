It was 95% ""don't touch the kids, don't be alone with the kids, don't do anything that might remotely be misconstrued as inappropriate. Especially you men in the room."" Literally told us that as guys we were immediately going to be suspicious to a passing mother or another permanent teacher, and that we had to be constantly on guard to not cause them suspicion because all it would take would be one accusation and we would be fired or worse. We were taught how to deflect kids that might try to hug us, etc etc etc.

Maybe Reddit blows it out of proportion, but I assure you it exists.",14,0,1444107126,1444730534

Not at all actually. But there are consequences to actions. If she feels so strongly about this that she needs to defy federal law, have at it. But consequences exist. 

""I can be tolerant of someone and disagree with their choices."" Yes. ""I can be tolerant of someone and vote against their values."" Sometimes. ""I can be tolerant of someone and protest their actions."" Sure.

But you can't be tolerant of someone and Legally or Physically stop them from doing/being whatever it is you don't like.",1,0,1441907749,1444730534
