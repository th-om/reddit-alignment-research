cux8c4y,0,t1_cux7h5l,LocalYocal,"October 15th, 1971, first gay couple filed for marriage. As of last year, there were over two million registered gay couples. I would say the percentage is increasing dummy, stop calling people ignorant. ",-2,0,1441921928,1444730426
cux61al,0,t1_cux5gml,LocalYocal,"Yeah you're right, there are lesbians. This is why Jerry Seinfeld doesn't play colleges anymore though, you're striving to be kind of pointlessly politically correct. I could see calling a deragatory or insulting joke ignorant, but not that. You're basically saying that a potential beard also now has the potential to be a lesbian, which I guess is true. 

I would also argue though that the percentage of gay couples has certainly increased over the years, as it has become more socially acceptable. There are a lot more people in gay relationships today, that probaby would've been married heterosexually 50 years ago, just in the closet. ",-3,0,1441918229,1444730426
cux55ct,0,t1_cux4lag,LocalYocal,"Well that's a debate between state's rights and federal mandates. I would say in the case of rights, I don't really care what Kentucky's citizens think about gay rights. That's not a state issue, there are gay people and a Kim Davis in every state.

cux4uhz,0,t1_cux47gt,LocalYocal,"I understand the legal precedence. Would you disagree that we should perhaps amend the legal code to facilitate some oversight of the position? Protecting a judge against public opinion? I fully support how that protects the integrity of the system. But a county clerk refusing to do her job and file paperwork? If she wanted to impact the judicial system in that manner, she should have become a judge. This is like a DMV employee refusing to give out a driver's license because someone's gay.

cux4gl3,0,t1_cux3inl,LocalYocal,"lol, had to. If you got a half a chuckle, then I did my job.",-5,0,1441915810,1444730426
cux4ei9,0,t1_cux3jve,LocalYocal,"That's interesting, thanks for the info. From my understanding of a clerk, the primary purpose is administrative and clerical, they are never to be interpreting the legal code like a judge would. I'm suggesting that we start holding government officals as accountable as society holds us. I understand they're elected officials, but with the state of political apathy and voter participation in this country, that doesn't mean much. ",-3,0,1441915722,1444730426
cux3sog,0,t1_cux3e61,LocalYocal,"If she had used her public office to openely racially discriminate, there is no way she would getting her job back. This country is already nutty about trying to red list people as suspected racists. You should google ""public officials fired for racism"" and look through the countless examples.

cux35s2,0,t1_cux2ptd,LocalYocal,"Again, it's a premise that relates the realities of the private sector to government, as it pertains to this situation and how it needs to change. Just food for thought, not a manifesto. Do you disagree with my point that if she had been discrimanting on the basis of race, she would absolutely not be coming back to work?

cux31a1,0,t1_cux2tqq,LocalYocal,"That was the whole point is for a political discussion, not a Q&A into the applicable legal code. I thought the Political Discussion sub was perfect for a political discussion on how ridiculous this situation is.  ",-2,0,1441913642,1444730426
