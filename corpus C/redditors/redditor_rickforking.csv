NEVER expect the Rams to do well against out of division teams as long as the awful Jeff Fisher is still head coach.",5,0,1444592190,1444731160

Is it just me or does that seem INSANELY high?",25,0,1443130449,1444731160
cvctgrs,0,t1_cvct0n0,rickforking,"Honestly...I would be ok with it.  I don't think a billion dollar tax on a poor city to pay for a stadium is a good thing.  

I've also been trying to break away from the NFL the last few years anyway.  It's hard to enjoy a game (for me) when I know these guys are *literally killing themselves* for my entertainment.  

I'm also busy as fuck.  Taking a big red marker and putting a giant X through 5 straight months of Sundays is really tough and feels almost wasteful.

The team leaving would probably allow me to leave the NFL behind, and I would, at least to some degree, be very grateful for that.",2,0,1443118160,1444731160
cvctcru,0,t1_cvcrhdg,rickforking,">If the Rams were to leave for L.A., St. Louis would become to the NFL what Seattle is to the NBA, a city that other teams use as a threat to get public funding for stadiums.

Except there is a 0% chance of that EVER happening.  The politicians just trying to keep the Rams here are really risking their own political careers.  It's incredibly unpopular to have the tax payers pay for the stadium.

I could be wrong.  Maybe the people in the city will miss the team more than I would expect or have shorter memories than I expect and in 20 years the good will to attract another team will be there, but I don't think so.  

We're *still* paying the current stadium off.  People are *still* mad that we paid for one in the first place.  St Louis is unlikely to ever pay for another stadium if the current team leaves.",12,0,1443117996,1444731160
cvcr6ai,1,t3_3m7vbb,rickforking,"I'm not convinced.  Clearly the owner really, *really* wants to move the team, but telling a city who is *ready to build a new stadium* to go fuck itself loses a lot of leverage for other teams to get new stadiums built by tax payers.  

Particularly when you look at things like [this](http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2014/nflwelfare/).  56% of people in that survey identify as NFL fans, but 79% oppose taxes for stadiums.  Funding NFL stadiums is a negative issue and only going to get worse.  For the NFL to tell a city that has taken the time and money to come up with a viable, tax-payer funded stadium ""no, we're leaving anyway"" would be a major blow to getting other cities to pay for them.  

NFL owners aren't stupid.  They know the short-sightedness of doing something like this.  I think the team only leaves if Stan pulls an Al Davis and just leaves anyway over the votes of the other owners.

cv8ay6x,1,t3_3lpo99,rickforking,"After the Bradford for Foles trade, a lot of Rams fans were rooting for Bradford to injured again or lose the job to Sanchez or some other thing.  

All I wanted was for him to play quarterback the same way he did in St Louis.  And it looks, through the first 1.5 games of the season, that he's doing exactly that.  He always had the tools, but was just never very good.",-3,0,1442783833,1444731160
