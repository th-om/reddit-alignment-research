This is due to SA being a prominent global and regional geopolitical force/ally, and other important economic factors (not just oil). To point the finger at oil is to naively oversimplify a highly complex issue.",1,0,1444351698,1444728818

It's funny because I even considered putting a disclaimer that it was a joke but I thought to myself, ""Nobody in their right mind could think this isn't a joke."" Only goes to show how wrong I was about just how stupid people can really be. 

In my ACTUAL comments, the ones with substance, arguments, evidence, and reasoning, I *did* say I was replying to more than 1 person at once, right here:

""You, and especially another commenter (sorry I don't want to spend time answering these separately, especially since you guys are arguing the same thing )assert that...""

I specifically said that so that you wouldn't continue this tired, desperate attempt and discrediting me by saying I'm ""putting words in your mouth."" So yeah, it's not ""more likes from the village liar"" it is ""more sheer stupid from the village idiot, u/BustnIt."" 

Don't worry I'm sure if you practice your reading skills and read my recent comments in this thread, you'll finally understand. 

**Speaking of making up lies, you are OPENLY making up lies and fabricating comments. I just reread these fake comments you wrote and it's OBVIOUS you are blatantly making up these fictional comments because the *AUTHOR OF THE COMMENTS IS A WOMAN! And I AM A MAN WITH WIFE AND KIDS!!!* Writing fake comments about me being a woman who was raped by her dad/uncle and became a prostitute... Definitely a new low I've seen on reddit. I will post proof when I get home that I am a fully grown man with a great career unrelated to prostitution.**


I honestly can't believe you didn't realize I could easily prove these insane allegations are false. How fucking sad and desperate, who goes on the internet and tries to totally defame a complete stranger for no reason? I haven't snooped through your history or made up stories about your life, I just was discussing the issue of exploitation in porn and you took it to another level.  

Anyways, you have failed to provide any evidence to support your view on the exploitation issue; you haven't even given an unsupported reason you believe they are exploited. You have resorted to insults and name-calling. You have committed a logical fallacy, 'ad hominem,' which is attacking the opponent's character/credibility rather than the idea itself, usually done in an attempt to hide the fact that they have no supporting evidence or strong arguments. Worst of all, you have stooped to the level of slanderous lies about me, goes as far as to *write fake comments about prostitution and rape and say I wrote them,* which is funny because of how easily proven false it is, but still very pathetic. So if you want me to post proof that i'm not who you say I am, I will, but othwerise I'm done here.",1,0,1443388974,1444728818

Bottom line is you've left the majority of my arguments unaddressed and still offered zero evidence to support your view, or even stated a reason why you belief that women are exploited in the adult industry, even though I've asked this of you multiple times. In policy debate not it addressing points is by default conceding them, and even though this is just an online debate the rules of debate are still in effect. Obviously this isn't a formal debate so a judge is not present to drop you, so go ahead and try to defend your view point If you want. 


Also, i hate to spoil your fun but whatever profile you were looking through was certainly not mine... None of that happened to me and I've never posted anything even remotely close to that.

cveu2x4,0,t1_cvdfsjs,PoonSafari,"Just for fun, I'll respond to this person who quotes a few sentences unrelated to my primary points, responds without any *actual substance* just insults and quips. Please, continue desperately clinging to the antiquated notion that women are exploited by evil sexist pigs in the adult industry, rather than having the same rights and the same means to make career choices, and be happy with their choices or adjust them accordingly, as a man in the industry.
 
You, and especially another commenter (sorry I don't want to spend time answering these separately, especially since you guys are arguing the same thing )assert that there is ""not a shred, not a single iota of evidence about women being exploited."" Person 1 conveniently skipped over that whole section and dismissed it as ""peripherally related"" and person 2 seems to have ignored it entirely. Please, either improve your reading skills or don't just read the section on exploitation then pretend it doesn't exist. One of those false statistics that has been floating around the public like ""you swallow X amount of spiders every year while you sleep"" (funnily enough was made to show how gullible the public is), is a quote by a CBS spokesman on TV saying ""Most women who try porn find it horribly exploitative, humiliating, degrading, and never return after their first shoot."" Conservatives repeat this constantly, their thought process being ""if most women leave after their first shoot, it must be horrible! why else wouldn't they want all that money? It must be hell!"" Actually, if you do the math using the data pool of 10,000 actresses you'll ~17% only do 1 shoot, with the predominant reason being they are in financial trouble and need a quick influx of cash, but don't want to seek a career in porn. Nothing about being exploited or humiliated. 

I mean, come on. This is just getting embarrassing for you guys. You openly assert that the study doesn't discuss exploitation or compensation, when in fact those 2 things are 2 of its main sections. If that's the level this discussion has devolved to, then I'm just going to move on.

Next, the biggest hole in your argument is the fact that you have provided 0 substance whatsoever, all while critiquing my source that you very clearly did not read or barely skimmed) let alone get the full report which is very thorough and detailed and would take you a lot longer to actually read and analyze). In fact, you haven't even done the BARE MINIMUM, which is just stating why you think women are ending exploited by sexist men, without even providing a source. You're literally just regurgitating conservative filth you've swallowed. If you're going to continually assert that women in porn are exploited by sexist men, then please provide evidence. Otherwise, you'll have to accept that you're wrong and come to grips with it. Well, you're eventually going to have to accept that one day, because while you may have been right 30 years ago, in 2015 you are far from the truth. 

Please, continue to argue that most women in porn are helpless, unhappy, and being exploited, while women in porn laugh their way to the bank. If you don't like a source with a 10,000 actress data pool that actually walks you through the steps to determine the truth behind a common ""porn = exploitation"" argument used by conservative pundits, the go ahead and use your own time to do some research and you'll find women usually earn $1000-$5000 per scene (depending on company and content) and usually shoot 5-15 times per month, depending on what directors are looking for her particular sex acts. This is all excluding the big money makers that generally only apply to popular actresses who have their own websites/products/etc. As you can see, an actress who isn't very busy and isn't very popular (which describes an average, non-famous actress) makes around $50,000 a year, which is above the national average annual wage. Cross referencing this figure against the actual average, yes it is a 50k average. 

Please keep insulting the women/boys stuck in the hellish world of sex trafficking by throwing around the word ""exploited"" in regards to women in their early 20s who voluntarily do work and earn wages comparable to many men the same age starting in finance or STEM careers. 

Do you live in California? I'm assuming you don't otherwise you wouldn't have such a warped, unhealthy view on porn. Try living in the state that produces ~85% of the world's porn and you'll meet many people who work in the industry. Maybe then you'll realize that most women in porn are not helpless and exploited.


Also yes, you did use a blanket statement to dismiss a large category of primary evidence as outliers. You said don't bother posting autobiographical evidence from women who are outliers in the industry due to their fame. Even if a actress is now successful, a question like ""When you started in the industry and were just an average actress, did you see women as being exploited by men in the industry?"" or ""Do you know many women in the industry that are not famous/successful? Would you say the majority are happy with their career, or is it primarily the successful ones?"" are totally legitimate, regardless of the woman in question's success. ",1,0,1443280280,1444728818

I mentioned the types of primary sources I intended to post, and they dismissed them as outliers, despite the fact that they directly address the issue of exploitation in the industry, simply because the actress is now successful (there's no way she could remember being an average actress, or have friends who are average in the industry /s). 

So rather than argue about the merits of actual adult actresses views on exploitation in the industry, I posted a source which uses a pool of 10,000 actresses information which is publicly available, and walks the reader through the step-by-step process of how to determine the truth of these claims. Again, this data is all publicly available, to attack its legitimacy is desperate at best.",1,0,1443224779,1444728818

Sasha Grey was merely a place to get started, if you weren't sure where to find non-porn interviews with the actresses. If you consider her an outlier, which she may be now that she's extremely wealthy, but she talks at length about her early career where she was just an average actress (which is what I meant in my previous comment, her thoughts/opinions about the work and industry when she was just an average actress).I never said all actresses have equal careers and equal opinions. Putting words in my mouth is no way to have a rational discussion. Plus, using a blanket statement to completely dismiss anyone who provides evidence that doesn't support your argument, is close-minded and frankly quite laughable. If you dismiss all interviews with porn stars that have/had a positive view on the industry as average actresses as ""outliers,"" then your mind is so closed there is no reason to continue the discussion, as it will be like trying to convince the Tea Party that Obama is not a Muslim. 

Since you were so adamant about not using outliers, look at this study of a pool of 10,000 porn actresses. It walks you through the steps used to determine the results so that there's no confusion about the integrity of the methods used, because some might immediately jump to the ""it's not published in Science so it's not legitimate! All studies not published in Science are false!"" It also cites many arguments commonly used by people such as yourself, and then uses the data to determine the truth of the claim. You'll need to download the full report, because the parts posted online are mostly about characteristics of average actresses, but there is lots of good information relevant to if women are actually being exploited or not (they aren't - it specifically refutes claims about it being degrading, humiliating, painful, disease ridden, exploitive, trapping them in the industry, etc).

cv9u57j,0,t1_cv7pu75,PoonSafari,"You feel bad I spent so much time typing....  some short paragraphs? I'm not sure how long it takes you to type a paragraph but I'm a little worried that I'm debating a child if you think that takes more than a few minutes... Hopefully you're just a slow adult. 

Ask yourself this: why are you so desperately clinging to the idealistic and impossible notion that men and women have brains that are built exactly the same way and function exactly the same way? I'm not saying that men are more intelligent than women, or vice versa. They just have slight differences (very slight, relative to the entire animal kingdom). Why is that a bad thing? We already know it to be factually true that the neurophysiology of male and female is not the same, as well as other things that affect brain functions like biochemistry and hormonal balances. Based on these facts, it is to be expected that there will be some slight differences in brain function. We are just still trying to figure out what exactly those differences are, and we've got a good general idea but haven't proved it definitively or nailed down details thoroughly.

Anyways, on to the study you said specifically refutes my claim and that's the end of it (most adorable thing you've written by the way). One paper with dubious evidence from a mediocre source does not automatically refute the idea of men being represented more than women along the extremes of quantitative abilities. Regardless of your cherry-picking a study just because it supports the minority opinion among scientific studies on this issue, I will still respond as if it were an impressive study with excellent sample size, quality peer-review, published In a prestigious journal science with rigorous requirements.

First, your study is on IQ, and quantitative abilities are only one element of IQ. It does not specifically discuss mathematical abilities or any other quantitative skill. Even if men and women are neurologically exactly the same (which is factually false), and women and men are represented exactly equally throughout the entire IQ spectrum (which the majority of studies show to be false), this does not prove or even suggest that women and men perform equally well at advanced and abstract mathematical tasks. 

Second, the fact that you posted one single study and then stated that this proves you are correct and I am incorrect, shows what little experience you have in both academic debate and scientific research. Even if you posted 100 studies that supported your argument, if the conclusion that the studies support is the *minority opinion* among the scientific community/studies on that issue, then it is unlikely to be true. I'm not saying that my stance is factually true, I'm saying the *majority of studies* on the subject support my claim, making it more likely to be true. Both of our stances are entirely possible. 

Next, you suggest that studies done on adults are flawed because childhood activities segregated by gender can affect intelligence, like Barbie vs Lego. 
1) the study you cited sampled adults, why cite a study as the foundation of your argument if you believe it to be flawed (and then tell me exactly how it's flawed)? 2) Sure, I agree childhood activities can affect intelligence to some small degree. But again, the *majority* of scientific studies on ""nature vs nurture"" indicate that while upbringing can affect adult intelligence to a small extent (so small that a common debate is if it is statistical error or actually due to upbringing), it is primarily based on genetics and physiology. 

You said I confuse fantasy with reality due to the fact that I said many women enjoy their careers in porn and are not forced into it by sexist men taking advantage of desperate women. What world do you live in? A parallel universe without Google apparently. You can go see for yourself, watch interviews with porn stars (actual interviews, not the ones in the porn videos meant to turn guys on), or go read the books they have written (Sasha Grey for example is fairly well spoken and write well). Sure there are bad stories, but those are the minority, just like other careers for *both genders.* Please note I'm not talkinhb about sex trafficking, which is a vile crime, I'm just talking about adult actresses in the US, who you seem to believe do not enjoy their careers and are somehow forced into it by the wicked patriarchy?

Finally, resorting to calling names and insulting the other party as a means of strengthening your side of a debate is a clear indicator that you do not possess the maturity nor the intelligence to have a rational discussion about an idea, so this will be my final response, as I have no doubt you will reply with more of the same.
