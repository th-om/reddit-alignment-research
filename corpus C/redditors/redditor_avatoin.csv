cvxtwdf,1,t3_3ojlwm,avatoin,"Communication is less effective when done remotely, even with web cameras, and politicians do A LOT of communication with each other. They are more effective being able to talk to somebody directly, side conversations, or the occasional lunch or gathering.

Have you tried working in a large company where sometimes meetings have to be done over Skype/WebEx? The communication is a lot worst and tends only to happened at planned meetings. But amongst my team, who are right next to me, I can communicate with them at lot easier, with ad hoc conversations, also body language plays a huge role. Web cameras don't allow me to throw an idea off my colleague over a cup of coffee after I bumped into her in the hallway.",1,1,1444711083,1444719705
cvxp2o1,1,t3_3oj0uq,avatoin,"In general no. But, assuming yes.

At first I'd would have thought Rubio, but then I attended a speech of his.

Then I thought Bush, then I keep hearing his opinions or certain events.

So maybe Kasich, then I find out he was one of the ones leading the charge against Clinton in the 90s.

So then I thought Carson, then I remembered why he even got mentioned in the first place. Then he kept talking.

So maybe Chris Christie, but maybe not.

So maybe Rand Paul... No, too libertarian.

So I just thought, nope. I couldn't do it. I can't vote against Sanders with any of these people.

God I miss Romney or Jon Huntsman.",1,1,1444702634,1444719705

cvwe6do,0,t1_cvwcn9u,avatoin,"We don't have scientific fact that certain races have an advantage. The current fastest runner is a Jamaican, at some point before that it was an American. The San Antonio Spurs won the NBA championship a couple years back its starting line-up is a bunch of white guys. The Patriots just won a Super Bowl and its team is a huge mix of races. Michael Phelps won more gold medals than anybody, and he is white. If you can show me a study that can link race to physical superiority, then maybe we can talk, but you seem to be cherry-picking and relying on stereotypes.",2,0,1444609347,1444719705

cvwd1t5,1,t3_3odsav,avatoin,"Eventually you will become to old to work, or at least it will be very hard to hire you because its safer to pay a younger person to do your job. And as you get older, everyday tasks become harder and more painful. So eventually you will need to stop working and retire until the day you die. But you still need money, you need to be able to afford a house, electricity, water, food, medicine and medical care, entertainment, etc.

Part of the money will usually come from the government. However, this tends to be a very small amount. So, during your working years you put aside money to save for retirement, just like a squirrel will save nuts for the winter. A retirement account puts this money aside, and usually invest it to grow in value. Most people will invest their retirement funds into a mix of the stock market and government bonds. Some will buy real estate that they can rent out or sale to provide income. 

Either way, the goal of the retirement account is to provide money for when you are too old to work.",1,0,1444607159,1444719705
cvwct3y,1,t3_3odym9,avatoin,"Imagine if one million people game Netflix $8 every month. Then Netflix would make $8,000,000 every month. That's not an insignificant amount of money. Now imagine that 3 years ago, Netflix had 30,000,000 subscribers. That's $240,000,000 every month. That's a lot of money.

Netflix reports to have over 60,000,000 subscribers world wide this year. That almost have a billion dollars, per month.",2,0,1444606708,1444719705
cvwcf56,1,t3_3odw9o,avatoin,"Does society accept that there are races physically superior? I don't think so.

Sex is different because its a lot easier to point out examples for many physical activities. There was just a report with the US military showing that women were more likely to get injuries in certain tasks than men. The fastest men are measurably faster than the fastest women. However, this only work in the extreme cases, such as professional athletes for some specific sports, and it would typically not be acceptable to deny a woman access to a physical task if they could prove that they could do it.

I don't think there is any evidence to show that there is any mental superiority between sexes, and definitely not between races. The best I can think of is that women's brain mature several years earlier than men, but I doubt this translates to any mental superiority.",1,0,1444605996,1444719705
