cvxauld,0,t1_cvx84a6,zDougie,"Sorry, I thought it was obvious.  A noisy and powerful group in the US prefer to follow the customs of a 2000 year old religion, based on an agrarian society where large families, season wars and every-man-responsible-for-himself.  Of course there are more details and this is a gross exageration, but in rough terms this is what the tea-party and theocratic republicans shuffle money towards.

Then we have another powerful crowd that consider themselves victims and that government must protect them and hand them everything on silver spoons.  Again, a gross over simplification and exageration, but in rough terms this is what most of the democrats shuffle money towards.

However the future is not going to be agrarian (farms and 'self-made-men').  Nor will it be factories (unions and hand-outs).  We must prepare for what nano technology is going to bring us.  Our communities (government?) need to provide highly flexible and available training in all kinds of fields.  We also need to take responsibility for parts of our communities that don't function as well as others.  

Money will continue to pool in limited areas and it needs a productive means of balancing.  Neither party are addressing the future.  So while still pretty generalized, does that help you understand what I was suggesting?",-5,0,1444680681,1444720828
cvx5qlq,1,t3_3oh768,zDougie,"Unfortunately, Bernie is still pretty light on details.  That combined with you not being specific regarding which items and what you would consider to be 'working' (and a time frame for accomplishment) makes ZernerDiod's brevity appropriate.

Overall, I like Bernie.  All my life (born 1962) I have seen how the democrats and republicans all work to siphon the public teet from this special interest to that special interest ... and somehow they and their families get rich and secure awesome careers.  To have someone challenge the endless efforts to manipulate the populous through fear tactics, endless wars and so on is quite pleasant [and yes I have supported Ron Paul in the past].

If we can pull 10% of the funds being directed towards big oil, international conglomarates, the military-industrial complex and use it to build up infrastructure and instill hope and confidence within the lower classes of our society - then I think it would be an awesome turn-around.  

Bernie won't win the primaries and if he did he would accomplish none of his currently stated goals.  But he CAN get on the bully-pulpit and force real discussions about the very serious malfunctions present in our society.  He can also help change the fight from 2000 year old religion to an economic system that will be effective 50 years from now.

I say give him all the support we can muster!",2,0,1444673341,1444720828

cvu8l6a,0,t1_cvu7cso,zDougie,"Yea.  Of course then there is heat and radiation, but those too would be gradual increases and waves - so yes.",2,0,1444430466,1444720828
cvu6dk0,0,t1_cvtlt8f,zDougie,"Well, 'see' is a process of detecting radiation within a specific frequency/wavelength.  'hear' is a process of detecting vibrations/changes in pressure or density.

In common circles, the most common thing discussed is 'solar winds' and 'solar sails'.  Some of the 'sail' concepts are working more with radiation than particles, but solar winds are about the enourmous volume of mass constantly being emitted from the sun out into the solar system.  I'm looking for a youtube that will address this better than I can ... 

Addendum: I guess I'm not going to find a 'science' thing on this because all the discussions are about the endless flow out from the sun.  It would be like discussing two people talking during a hurricane - there's no way you would hear each other.  Due to the speed and energy level of the mass being emitted, they discuss and treat it as radiation ... even though a lot of it is in-fact just mass.  In between stars though there is still mass, and waves and pools or pockets of density.  Of course to detect these miniscule quantities and 'hearing' the variations would probably not be possible.

Maybe all this gives you some ideas though?  One nice Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYRpXZjkHlU

cvsso4q,1,t3_3nzhpo,zDougie,"I want each candidate to be given several minutes per topic within which the candidate must speak directly to the topic and NOTHING else.  Real topics like:

* Corporations as people and Money as speech. (to me this is the sole item issue that will make a no-go for a candidate).
* Polution control - not just carbon but all of it ... mercury, carbon and so on.  This topic must be addressed at the Federal level, State level and Global/trade level.
* Police/Law reform - remove polticing from sentencing.  Who should be in prison?  How do we make sentencing more equal regardless of race or social demographics?  How should Jail/Prisons be financed?  How do we de-militarize our police?
* Federalizing healthcare and if they support single payer, how to introduce competition and/or price controls.

cvsonom,0,t1_cvsl1am,zDougie,"I'm not sure what I said that sponsored the last paragraph, but I love your last paragraph.

An interesting example in my mind is Palestine.  For years, dozens of foreign countries sent money to the PLO and other semi-official entities there.  That money was to build infrastructure, develop functional police forces and so on.  I will skip the issue of how they actually spent the money, but suffice to say that policing their own territory never seemed to be of interest to them.

Israel was endlessly attacked by forces operating in, taking refuge in and maintaining weapons, rockets and so on in the Palestinian territories.  Yet Palestine never took efforts to police such persons.  When Israel took matters into its own hands, it was Israel that was labeled as terrorists, not the Palestinians.

There is much more to this story, but I'd like your comments on that ... as well as Mexican gangs operating in Los Angeles and other areas of the US.

Thanks,",2,0,1444324786,1444720828
cvslgaw,1,t3_3nywry,zDougie,"Weird question.  Sound is made of pressure waves and I've read that technically the solar system itself is a kind of 'atmosphere' around the sun.  So I think the question would resolve down to how much mass compression is required to be 'heard'.  

What type of device are you thinking of for doing the hearing?  What type of mass are you thinking of (photons aren't really mass, but much of the radiation is mass ...)?  

Do you see where I'm going?  We 'hear' pressure variation in the gaseous mass that surrounds us, so at what point would you say it is no longer audible?",2,0,1444320111,1444720828
cvskhr2,0,t1_cvsjks3,zDougie,"I agree with every one of your points.  I even agree with GuavaOfAxe that it is a euphemism, but ... since Congress has authorized the military actions I wonder if we aught to go ahead and call it war.

Many people look at Websters as though it is some form of bible on correct English usage.  Thus 'terrorism' means everything from Bernie Sanders using angry phrases about 'revolution' to WWII, Vietnam and so on.

Prior to 9/11, the working definition of terrorism was pretty reasonable.  Any action that would traditionally be reserved for war being used by non state entities against non militarily valid targets to force community and/or state change.  For reference, look at the UN materials regarding acts of war and the various resolutions that use the term terrorism.

George Bush is not god.  We need to push a return to the pre-9/11 usage.  If such acts are not committed or sponsored by state entities, then they are crimes and should be treated as such.",1,0,1444318675,1444720828
cvmhhwn,0,t1_cvlz8c0,zDougie,"I have never been much of a fan for using webster style definitions ... because too often people use the words or terms in a way that is not consistent with such definitions.  

You imply that you are law enforcement, and that is fine.  The definition you provide is pretty much what I learned in the military back in the 80's and my son says that he was pretty much taught the same thing in the marines in the 2000's.  However, my comments are regarding actual practice in the US in recent years.  Perhaps your department is different, but I know that many areas around the country are not using such a definition in their actual practices.

I have had a burr up my butt since I first learned of such things back in the late 70's.  Swat and Hawaii 5 O were big hits at the time.  Much of what ran on these shows offended me, but I figured most of it was just theatre.  As a teen and later, I learned that swat teams were being formed in every city for damn near no reason.  I also learned of search and seizure (sp?) practices that I found abominable.  Then about how they can take property, even that which is not owned by the presumed offender, at the time of arrest - without waiting for conviction or assignment of costs and such.

So I keep my ears to the ground on these matters.  I will avoid examples that are vague 'I heard' stories and use Vista California as an example (at the time I lived and worked near by).  There had been ""riots"" over a period of 3 days in north-east Vista.  IMO the riots were almost laughable, but that's not the point.  However a bunch of military-like equipment showed up and maintained a perimeter of control for 2 days in the area (blocking normal route home).  Afterward, they used video, pictures and so on to identify 'potential provocateurs' and 'responsible parties'.   They had to choose justifications for searches premises and convincing friends and family to rat them out.

To shorten it up, they used 'civil disorder' for some, 'gang activity' and 'terrorism' where ever they needed to play the system to their interest.  The courts let it play out and when it went to prosecuting the defendants they used totally different terms and arguments.  The press had a field day, but the courts and juries played like idiots and let it go even when presented in court.

That combined with the last decade of pushing military hardware into local municipalities under the terms 'national security' and 'terrorism' freely and liberally ... even where there is absolutely no reason to use such terms.

I wish I could be a believer ... but ... ",1,0,1443846832,1444720828
