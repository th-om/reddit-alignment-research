What I do think is wrong is trying to say it's ""just for fun"" implying a link between trophy hunters and true psychopaths. Plus no one is protesting the **millions** of deer trophy killed in the united states every year but I'm supposed to care about a single lion? Why?

Edit: *I'm* not saying women should or do blindly vote for Hillary. Just drawing a comparison to someone saying black Americans ""should"" vote for Bernie and someone saying women ""should"" vote for Hillary and how it's rude, condescending, and doesn't make any sense. I thought that was clear within the context of the comment thread but judging by the downvotes it apparently wasn't.",0,0,1444656025,1444716887
