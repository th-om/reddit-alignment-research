First, he doesn't look like a nobody.

Second, not peaking early means you can see what the field looks like, what attacks might look like, what tactics might not work, you don't become an early target, and so on. Plenty of benefits, but not without risk.

> More laughable spin. ""Doing fine"" is not the point of political fundraising. Having the biggest war chest is.

It's not about having the most, but having enough. And he has enough for now.

> So the media quoting a staffer's spin magically makes it true? Fascinating. Somehow I doubt you would apply this principle to anyone else.

When it comes to what a campaign strategy is, yes. Especially since Rubio isn't floundering

> It is when it gives you no advantages and costs you supporters and money.

Which isn't happening. 

> It's really just kind of a weird statement to make. Are you high, by any chance? Just curious

Not high, but just applying whatever logic you're using to the race. ",1,1,1444696016,1444716306
cvxkgcm,0,t1_cvxisjj,ClockOfTheLongNow," > I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding what you are saying here, but the Democrats have actually won the popular vote in the majority of the presidential elections in the past 30 years

Won the popular vote, yes. Majority of the popular vote, no. Clinton never got higher than 49%ish.

> Denying that gerrymandering exists and does cause disproportionate representation, and that current estimates say democrats would have around 20 more seats if the lines were drawn fairly, or over 30 more seats and control of the house if they drew the lines, is ignoring reality.

Distracting helps both parties, sure, but it is not the fault of districting that ideological clusters exist, nor can you make proportional conclusions in a geographic model. To assume the results would be the same if we ran elections proportionally is an error.

cvxi65v,0,t1_cvxh14r,ClockOfTheLongNow,"> It makes about as much sense as a football team purposely not making gains on the field or a sprinter lagging behind in the hope of catching up later. 

Actually, this is a common move in many race-type sports.  You don't want to be the lead the entire time, and you can actually benefit from the people in front of you.

> Because taking the lead gives you access to millions and millions of dollars in campaign funds that you can use later? This isn't fucking rocket science, man.

And Rubio is doing fine on the fundraising side.

> What's that supposed to mean?

You claim it's some weird, unknown strategy, yet the media has reported on it.

> Still, it is more likely that he is simply not doing well and is making the best of it. It is less likely that he is sabotaging his own campaign as a part of some master-plan.

I disagree.  Laying low is not sabotage.

> I will define ""good"" as ""first place or close second"". In that sense, he is indeed ""not good"".

cvxi01s,0,t1_cvxhc3r,ClockOfTheLongNow,"> The presidential results do. The country is becoming more democrat even if the majority of the states are republican, because the majority of the population of the US lives in 9 states, most of which are democrat.

I'm not sure we have the data for that.  The Democrats have only won the majority of the popular vote under Obama in the last 30 years, no other time.

> Congress should be about split but right now is heavily gerrymandered giving republicans an estimated 20-25 seats they wouldn't have in a fairly apportioned system that reflects the voters accurately.

""Accurately"" implies a proportional model when we have a geographic one.  The gerrymandering excuse needs to stop at some point.  

> The senate could very likely flip next year

Very true, but it's likely to track with the presidential results given how well the Republicans did last year.  If the Republican is a president, I expect both houses to stay the same.",1,0,1444691486,1444716306

cvxhw6x,0,t1_cvxhqla,ClockOfTheLongNow,"> I disagree with this in part--I think that the core of the Democratic party leadership is really heavily invested in moderating positions, making accomodations,and controlling the far flank of the party. 

I think they give that appearance and have the media in their back pocket willing to advance that narrative, but if we look at who they're electing and promoting into higher office?  I mean, Clinton, Obama, Reid, and Pelosi are not into moderating positions.
>  The DNC really wants to police that out of the mainstream of the party. There's also the role of policy, which in some cases is moderating. For example, in foreign policy the average view of a lot of progressives borders on isolationism, and the foreign policy establishment absolutely does not support that, which is part of why it doesn't show up much in the Dem platforms that actually win elections.

I guess the issue is that the conflict you speak of doesn't get the press the establishment/base one for Republicans do.

cvxgkwj,0,t1_cvxgdy8,ClockOfTheLongNow,"> It's not a ""strategy"". 

Of course it is.  You limit your exposure, you let the rest of the field duke it out, and you slip in when the timing is right.  This is not some sort of weird, strange strategy.

> Do you think Rubio would turn down high poll numbers if he could have them? 

He might in September or October a year before the election, yes.  Why make yourself a target?  

> a. Rubio has an unorthodox campaign strategy that nobody knows about, which somehow involves not raising money and fighting tooth-and-nail to hang on to 3rd place... all according to ""the plan"".

It's not unorthodox, and it's not unknown.  I linked you to the Washington Post, for god's sake.

> I think you pretty much have to be a fanboy conspiracy theorist to actually believe that (a) is more likely than (b). Am I wrong?

Dead wrong.  Rubio isn't even my first choice, and I'm still undecided as to whether I'll be backing him in the primary.  Do you know what a middling candidate looks like?  Mike Huckabee.  Lindsay Graham.  Rand Paul.  Mike Kasich.  Scott Walker figured out he was middling and bailed.

Rubio's situation looks *nothing* like theirs.

> He's in the ""top tier""? Meaning not the worst? Isn't that what I just said? That he wasn't the worst, but he wasn't ""good""?

He's not ""not good.""  Your claim is to shunt him to the loser's bracket and nothing about his performance supports that.
