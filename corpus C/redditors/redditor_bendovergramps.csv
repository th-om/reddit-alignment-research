cvvyu8e,0,t1_cvvw7hb,bendovergramps,"> Pro-gun advocates believe that people should be able to protect themselves and you don't need to have an abortion to protect yourself from someone else having an abortion. 

Spuriously worded. Pro-gun people should protect themselves, but yes, there are things you would want to protect yourself from by having an abortion. For instance: not being ready for a child, financially or emotionally. Sure, you could say, ""use protection, or abstain!"" The truth of the world right now is that sexual maturity does not guarantee mental maturity, and people make mistakes. The only person paying for their mistake is the mother going through an abortion, which pro-lifers seem to view as a walk in the park.....

I asked for dissenting opinions. So please go eat a dick with this patronizing bullshit. This is a friendly sub, dude.",-6,0,1444584497,1444731064
