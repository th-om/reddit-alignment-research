cvxtlcw,0,t1_cvxgou9,Lung_doc,"I've usually seen us listed 4th too, like [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Metropolitan_Statistical_Areas) where we are listed with a pop of 6.9M.

But [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_urban_agglomerations_in_North_America) we are sixth - also by wikipedia.  This looks to be more what I think of as the metroplex, and has a population at 4.6M for 2012. The order goes New York, Chicago, LA, Philidelphia, Miami and DFW.

It seems the former is a [""metro statistical area""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas-Fort_Worth,_TX-OK_Combined_Statistical_Area#Combined_Statistical_Area)

cvwyxpb,1,t3_3og9wa,Lung_doc,"I had a job for a while where I had one weekday off in return for occasional weekends - loved my personal time sooo much.

I was able to do this again recently, except my husband's home and it just wasn't the same.  I love seeing him, but that time thats 100% my own was so great.

I tried to recreate some ""me"" time - exercise while listening to books on tape or even watching a tv show at the gym - but its not the same.

I don't have any great advice except maybe see if your husband can take the kid out for a daddy and me date once a week to give you a few hours.

And be patient - a few more years makes a big difference as far as work related to taking care of kids.",4,0,1444662863,1444728440
cvwv35g,0,t1_cvwmmcx,Lung_doc,"Yes - some of both

The worry about being a nuisance I think is common during their early 20s.  You just miss your kids so much when they leave home, but you also remember sometimes loving to hear from your mom and sometimes thinking - again?  So you hesitate to call.

I also have a friend whose kids completely rejected her - for reasonable reasons I suspect, but it's been years now.  

I sometimes want to reach out to the kids and say please call - maybe just on mothers day? It would just mean so much to her.",1,0,1444655118,1444728440

cvweaks,0,t1_cvvswtc,Lung_doc,"Interesting point.  I'm almost always the one to call my mom because she's retired and I know if I call her, it's a 90% chance it's a good time to talk.  And the reverse is not true at all - so I try to call every week.

But I'm almost never the one to call my son.  I might text him to say hey can we talk sometime?  

And he says yes we should! But may or may not say when and may not call for another week.  

And I feel like maybe I'm bugging him...  ",2,0,1444609568,1444728440
cvw7wab,0,t1_cvw5jzp,Lung_doc,Right.  And the reason the beer aisle at my grocery store is cordoned off also has nothing to do with religion.  Because I'm sure the grocery store employees notice a big difference in workload with that one aisle blocked off....,17,0,1444598327,1444728440
cvw7tp2,0,t1_cvw4ds4,Lung_doc,"That's true.  But I hate our weird alcohol laws too.  I lived in San Diego for a while, and we just bought liquor at the grocery store.  There were  very few liquor stores - some specialty stores for wine or greater selection, but none of these scary stores with bars on the window with urine stains on the sides that one must visit if you live in certain ""dry"" areas of dfw.",6,0,1444598211,1444728440

I only use it once every year or two, and keep it stored in Oklahoma (lake texoma) - but I'm supposed to drive up there, drag it over the border to find a ""trailer inspector"" and get some form so I can then renew my registration.

I just normally hate subscriptions because half the time I forget to cancel it when i stop using it - and then finally notice it on my credit card  a few months later.

So now I just get so annoyed at companies with autorenewal as the only option that I usually avoid them.",1,0,1444583224,1444728440
