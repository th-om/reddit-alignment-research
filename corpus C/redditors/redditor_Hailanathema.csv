I'm convinced that the South has generally moved to voting more Republican over time, I'm not convinced either parties stance on racial issues is the reason why.

> ""Republicans appealed to anti-civil rights sentiment to win elections"" is simply making an observation based on empirical and historical fact.

Sure but, again, you said:

>Guess who supported racial segregation and supported things like ""states' rights to resist forced busing"" at that time and in the decade after: Republicans.

Are you saying people who are in favor of racial segregation are not necessarily racists?

>Yes we do.

What part of this document shows Republicans attempting to appeal to segregationists? The closest I can see is the recommendation to take a hard stance against forced busing but, as I noted up thread, over 90% of people of both races were against forced busing. If most people want lower taxes, including segregationists, and I try to get people to vote for my by saying I'll lower taxes, is that also courting seggregationists?",1,0,1444681957,1444718134
cvx80al,0,t1_cvx6p20,Hailanathema,">""Southern strategy"" is not just a general term for the strategy used by political campaigns to attract voters in the South; it is a particular phrase used to describe a particular strategy during a particular time period.

What I'm saying is I don't find the argument that it exists or was effective to be very convincing. All the elections that are pointed to as evidence of the Southern Strategy working are elections where Republicans won 80% or more of the states. I don't think a national election win on that scale tells you very much about geographically local changes, presumably whether or not Republicans successfully appealed to segregationists they would have won, as they did in many other democratic states (this is particularly true of 1984 and 1972 when Republicans won 49/50 states). 

>the assertion that ""1964 began fundamental changes in the way southern whites voted"" and that ""the southern strategy is not just a myth"" does not imply that 100% of Southern states should vote for Republicans 100% of the time in 100% of elections. That's absurd, and nobody is making that claim. Stop trying to pull single cases and use them as evidence that the general assertion is incorrect.

Alright, let's grant that pre-1964 the South was solidly Democrat and after 1964 it had generally become more Republican. You posit the theory that this is because Republicans successfully appealed to segregationists and so segregationists started voting for them. This doesn't make sense to me, presumably the highest percentage of voters who were pro-segregation was during Jim Crow and its immediate aftermath, but the south got more Republican as we got farther away from segregation and, presumably, as the number of voters who were pro-segregation decreased.

>Literally nobody has said anything close to this. AFAIK, you're the only person who has mentioned racism. I would highly recommend you avoid employing straw men like that, as it prevents meaningful instruction from occurring.

EDIT: I know you didn't literally make the connection that republicans are racist *because* the people that vote for them are, but that seems like a pedantic point to make.

You said Republicans were the party in favor of racial segregation.  If that's not calling Republicans racist I'm unsure what is.

As you said:

>Guess who supported racial segregation and supported things like ""states' rights to resist forced busing"" at that time and in the decade after: Republicans.

>The ""Solid South"" was largely a Democratic bastion until this realignment, after which time it turned solidly Republican. We know that this happened.

If by ""turned solidly Republican"" you mean gradually, after 30 years or so, then sure.

>We know that Republicans capitalized on anti-civil rights sentiment to win elections.

We know no such thing. I'd be curious to see statements from any Republicans saying they want to bring back segregation or take away minorities rights.

>People have admitted such.

Saying ""we wrote off the black vote"" is not the same as ""we are in favor of racial segregation"", and it would be strange for Republicans to be the party that voted more strongly for the [Civil Rights Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#By_party) than Democrats, then turn around and campaign against.

Pretty much everyone supported an end to forced busing. A poll in the early 1970's showed 96% of white and 91% of blacks were [opposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desegregation_busing#Criticism) to forced busing.

Even [Jimmy Carter](http://crdl.usg.edu/export/html/ugabma/wsbn/crdl_ugabma_wsbn_68770.html?Welcome) was opposed to forced busing. I don't really see how Republicans resistance to forced busing is evidence of racism, given pretty much everyone else was also opposed to it.

>Because he's a Southerner. See what I said about Carter above.

This seems like a double standard, when the South votes for Republicans it's because Southerners are racist and Republicans are by extension racist, but when the South votes for Democrats it's just because they're southern. Does Bush being from the South (governor of Texas) then explain why the South voted for him? Or is it because of the Southern Strategy for Bush also?",2,0,1444673514,1444718134

Regarding those elections, Republicans won 40+ states in 1972, 1980, 1984, and 1988. So inasmuch as they won the south, they won everywhere else too.

If we go past 1988, Clinton carried about half of the south in [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1992), and about a third in [1996] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1996).

cvwy1hs,1,t3_3of7i5,Hailanathema,"I think you're confused about abortion here. 

>Theme 1

You talk as if any act removing a fetus from the womb was aborting it (including c-sections and inducing labor), but abortion is removing a fetus from the womb *with the intention of endings its life.* People who are anti-abortion are not generally anti-C-section or anti-inducing-labor because these are generally done with the intention of having the child live. If abortion is purposefully killing a fetus then the point at which it becomes viable outside the womb is a pretty obvious candidate for when it becomes wrong.

>Theme 2

You seem to be making two separate arguments here.

1. The argument people that are anti-abortion are making is that abortion decreases the sanctity of human life and leads to a general breakdown of societies moral values.

1. Our current system could not handle so many unwanted children, leading to those children having to liver lives of abject poverty (lives not worth living?) and be a general drag on society.

The second one (and the majority of your argument) seem pretty orthogonal to the first one, and I don't think anyone who isn't religious makes the first argument anyway.

Overall, I don't see how either of the arguments in theme 1 or 2 require religion in order to make sense, both of them make sense just fine as secular systems of morals.",2,0,1444661302,1444718134
cvvn0w8,1,t3_3oa3ea,Hailanathema,"As others have said classical liberalism is mostly about treating the individual as the atomic unit of society and respecting the rights thereof. I think the classical liberal intuition is put more eloquently than I by the following quotes from John Stuart Mill and Robert Nozick.

>That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him, must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.

--John Stuart Mill ""On Liberty""

>Why not ... hold that some persons have to bear some costs that benefit other persons more, for the sake of the overall social good? But there is no *social entity* with a good that undergoes some sacrifice for it's own good. there are only individual people, different individual people, with their own individual lives. Using one of these people for the benefit of others, uses him and benefits the others. Nothing more...Talk of an overall social good covers this up...To use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take into account of the fact that he is a separate person, that this is the only life he has. *He* does not get some overbalancing good from his sacrifice, and no one is entitled to force this upon him---least of all a state or government that claims his allegiance (as other individuals do not) and that therefore scrupulously must be *neutral* between its citizens.
