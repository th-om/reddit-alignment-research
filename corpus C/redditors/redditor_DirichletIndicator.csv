cvx9gm3,0,t1_cvx4flg,DirichletIndicator,"The .17 number is certainly interesting.  If true and truly meaningful, it pretty much invalidates any other argument.  The man was effective, he should stay.  But there are claims that the number wasnt statistically significant, which could mean he was simply not bad enough to fuck his students over in a significant way, and also a few really smart kids ended up in his section.  It could also be that kids who are good at picking the easy professor remain good at picking the easy professor the next year.  It could also be that kids who check professor ratings before signing up (his classes are fuller, hence full of people who actively chose their section) are more conscientious students.  If so, his flagrant disregard for department policy plus his lack of research potential make his dismissal entirely justified.  

So yes, that number would in principle mean he should stay.  I don't feel it makes for a definitive case without a closer look at the data at least, and even then we have to worry about confounders.  The simple fact is that it's effectively impossible to know if he was a better teacher or not.  ",3,0,1444678699,1444726168

The only relevant issue is how much it would cost, because I refuse to believe that the federal government couldn't rally up as much concrete as it wants with enough money.  

Edit: also, that article assumes the wall would be well built and effective.  But the federal government is doing it based on a campaign promise, so if it happens at all it will be shoddy and cheap and easy to tunnel under, greatly reducing the materials needed. ",2,0,1444585915,1444726168

Multiplication distributes over addition in both variables, but exponential distributes over multiplication only in one variable.  In the other variable, addition becomes multiplication.  

If you want an operation that distributes over multiplication, it would be commutative, namely a^ln(b) , but iterating multiplication 3 times would correspond not to ""exponentiating"" by 3, but ""exponentiating"" by e^3 .  Because we index the number of iterations additively in normal exponentiation (1, 2, 3...) instead of multiplicatively (e^1 , e^2 , e^3 ...) the operation is fundamentally asymmetric.
