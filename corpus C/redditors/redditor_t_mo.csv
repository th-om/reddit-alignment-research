But if you can't even, then maybe it isn't the article that is false.",1,0,1444326473,1444727131

For example: asset valuation.

cvsnyjy,0,t1_cvsnq4v,t_mo,"It seems to me that the article is proposing 200 and *you* are proposing 40.

To suggest that, for no reason other than you proposing it, the latter is a fact and the former an inaccurate assumption, is what does not seem to have a basis in reality.

Both figures seem to be theoretical presumptions, based on limited real information, but yours includes additional assumptions that the first does not include.

Not that I think either is a 100% accurate reflection of reality. But these additional assumptions on your part seem to indicate an even further departure from reality than that article.",1,0,1444323810,1444727131
cvsnfga,0,t1_cvsmurx,t_mo,"And you are suggesting that, because that article uses the theoretical value of the assets he inherited and follows through with a hypothetical investment scenario, the article is inaccurate.

But, because you use the theoretical value of those assets, *add in an additional hypothetical scenario*, then follow through with a hypothetical investment scenario, that you are not inaccurate?",1,0,1444323016,1444727131

cvsm071,0,t1_cvslnju,t_mo,"This is incorrect, he still would have done better if he had only invested for a portion of that 30 year period, or gradually divested himself over the course of the period.

What you are suggesting is an extremely low diversity high-risk approach, this is closer to the method he actually used, and it appears to have worked fairly poorly for him, relative to abundantly available alternatives.",1,0,1444320910,1444727131
cvsl0v3,0,t1_cvskkge,t_mo,"My impression is that this account does not address reality:

People who invest their wealth into an unmanaged index fund can still spend their money and therefor experience all that life has to offer.

He is worth less than he would be, not the same as, compared to using an unmanaged fund. Based on the averaged return of the S&P500 over the last 30 years he would be worth almost double had he made no significant independent investments over that time period.

The more successful man isn't the issue (and is difficult to even define), the wealthier man is the issue (and it is easy to define), the wealthier man is the one who started with as much money as trump and utilized nothing but an unmanaged fund.",1,0,1444319471,1444727131
cvsk0uv,0,t1_cvsjoa7,t_mo,"The suggestion is that he would have made *more* if the *only* thing he did was use an average index fund. He almost certainly has a diversified investment portfolio which *includes* this type of investment, but also includes substantial losses which the fund would not have sustained on a long term average.

Clearly a low diversity portfolio (a single index fund and nothing else) is not optimal, as I stated there are investment methods which have higher average returns based on higher risk investments. Trump has a lower average return than taking a very low-risk low-return approach.

cvseljq,0,t1_cvse90q,t_mo,"It is just a statement about how money works, the index fund is just an aggregate method of doing the exact same things trump was attempting to do independently (lend money to businesses, transfer between businesses, sell and reinvest assets, etc).

Successful investors with diverse portfolios will often outperform index funds, because the aggregated method is somewhat standardized and more risk averse than some talented investors, but the funds still make a lot of money relative to not investing at all (money in the mattress, or savings account).

The message is that trump, with all his business acumen, under performed compared to a relatively risk averse method of investing.  

Imagine a football coach that has near absolute certainty that if his team does nothing but run the ball it will score a total of 14 points in the game. Trump is the team manager, he wants to pass the ball using plays he designed during some portion of the game instead of just running every play. The team scores considerably less than 14 points in the end. Trump congratulates himself, because the team scored so many points under his decisive management.",4,0,1444308424,1444727131
