Plus, all this likening it to wonders of the ancient world... Given that many people are looking for large spending projects on public works, I am almost more pro-wall now than I was before I read it.

Well, I've been to ones that run the gamut.  Your committee has a document in hand, I assume, so they already should already understand the technical details.  Were I you, I would try to make sure that the lay people at least have a basic idea.  You can have an introduction to each idea for the audience, then give the important technical details for awhile, and repeat.",4,0,1444468045,1444716398
