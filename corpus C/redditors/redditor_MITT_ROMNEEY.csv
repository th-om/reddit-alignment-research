Is it not reasonable to say that if they were part of the TPP, it would increase the demand for slaves?

cux68io,0,t1_cux5ali,MITT_ROMNEEY,"Of course free trade is more complicated than that and there is something called comparative advantage, but you're not helping your case with ad hominem attacks and shooting down straw man arguments. For starters, many people are against free trade deals not because ""dey took our jobs!"" Engaging in trade with developing nations perpetuates worker exploitation in those nations. In all honesty, I doubt that most of Bernie's supporters really care about trade with developed countries. Also there is merit to the argument that free trade outsources jobs. That is not to say that there aren't some positive results from trade deals like NAFTA but you should not be saying that people who disagree with you don't understand economics. http://www.epi.org/blog/naftas-impact-workers/",2,0,1441918537,1444730944

cua9ehw,0,t1_cua8wqt,MITT_ROMNEEY,What do you mean I don't have a say? Of course I have a say I can vote for senators  and representatives who would vote for a constitutional amendment. Also we do not need to always blindly accept whatever they say nor do we always have to trust them. That's such an elitist thing to say. And how does the system break down if we don't believe them? If they're wrong we vote for people who would push for a constitutional amendment and that's that. It's easier said than done but you get the idea. ,1,0,1440125832,1444730944
cua8hsh,0,t1_cua5c4n,MITT_ROMNEEY,"And they're doing a pretty shitty job at interpreting the constitution if they just blatantly ignore the fact that the constitution explicitly prohibits the state promoting religion. It isn't even one of those instances where the wording is vague either. I would even go as far as to say that any justice that truly believes that government references to God are ok is not qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice. Honestly though, do you even realize that the Supreme Court can make really bad decisions like Dred Scott v. Sanford, Bush v. Gore, Plessy v. Ferguson and Hammer v. Dagenhart. All of these were terrible decisions and you're telling me that they are always right and can do no wrong? ",1,0,1440124096,1444730944
cua2lyu,0,t1_cua27dd,MITT_ROMNEEY,You clearly don't understand what I'm saying so I'll simplify it. Some traditions are good for culture like holidays because they are fun and bring people together which is reason enough to continue those traditions. However saying that we should do something JUST BECAUSE it's a tradition is a logical fallacy. This would apply to references to God on currency when you say that we should do it simply because it's tradition. ,1,0,1440113301,1444730944
