cvxukn5,0,t1_cvxu3d4,noelsusman,Yeah I kind of just assumed that part since that's why a bunch ended up in Atlanta.  They certainly didn't come here for the weather.,2,0,1444712643,1444723966
cvxsx0z,0,t1_cvxs5gp,noelsusman,"You can thank the steel crash of the 70s and 80s for at least part of it.  Tons of Pittsburgh residents had to move and San Diego was/is a prosperous, growing city with great weather.

As an Atlanta fan I'm very familiar with this phenomenon.",29,0,1444709043,1444723966
cvxq2ic,0,t1_cvxpz59,noelsusman,"SD, like Atlanta, is a transplant city.  Also the Steelers have been good for a long time which helps build a wide fan base (bandwagons turn into family teams).

The darker side of this is that the collapse of steel in Pittsburgh in the 70s and 80s caused a huge number of Pittsburgh residents to move elsewhere.  Growing cities like San Diego were a popular destination for those people (same with Atlanta, there's a huge Pittsburgh fan base here).",2,0,1444704167,1444723966
cvxpudg,1,t3_3oiplv,noelsusman,Blake is reaaaaaaally lucky that dogging it didn't cost him the touchdown.  Guarantee he'll be getting his ass chewed out at practice for that one.,10,0,1444703804,1444723966
cvxij75,0,t1_cvww37x,noelsusman,"Yeah, the plan was to suck this year pretty much on purpose.  I mean, we traded away almost all of our talent over the offseason.  The idea is to get competitive again in time for the new stadium in 2017, but we'll see how that works.

Also there are still rumors that Fredi will be getting the ax at some point.  Keep him around to lead the shit team and bring in a new coach for our shiny new team in a shiny new stadium in 2017.  That's the theory at least.",2,0,1444692351,1444723966
cvxi4tj,1,t3_3oifz6,noelsusman,"Yup, I did that exact thing this morning.  I dropped the guy I was going to drop for waivers to pick up Carolina and I'll drop Baltimore for waivers instead.  I was glad I noticed it.",1,0,1444691705,1444723966
cvxhkhy,0,t1_cvxdf6s,noelsusman,"TBS is pretty bad but that can go both ways.  In general male students tend to look down on female students and assume they don't know what they're doing.  Most male students are good about this, it's not like women on campus can't find anybody who respects them, but the minority is big enough that almost every woman I've talked to on campus about this has experienced it at some point.  There's also the general ""boy's club"" atmosphere that can make some women feel uncomfortable and alienated, but I haven't found that to be too bad on campus.

In general I've found that in settings like group projects if a woman knows her stuff then there are rarely any serious issues with her feeling welcome or part of the group.  It's when a woman may not be up to par that she gets unfairly singled out more than a man would if he wasn't up to par.  That's just what I've seen but limited sample size and all that.

The issues that cause the gender gap in engineering students start in childhood before anyone even arrives at Tech, but those are slowly changing for the better and it's showing in the numbers.

FWIW I've seen much worse gender discrimination out in the real world than I have on campus.  In the context of current society I think Tech is pretty good about it, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement.",-2,0,1444690781,1444723966
cvxgir0,0,t1_cvx401t,noelsusman,lol Keenan Allen is my WR1.  That team is nuts.  Edelman and Ingram on the bench?  Unless that's an 8 team league that guy has already won.,3,0,1444689087,1444723966
cvxgamh,0,t1_cvxeoi8,noelsusman,"It's supposed to be for players where there is no conceivable reality in which dropping them makes any sort of sense.  It limits the damage from people rage dropping their team or just doing something really stupid without realizing it.

You can always turn it off if you don't want it.  I turn it off in my leagues even with some major tacos because I can manually repair any damage that's done.  Haven't had any problems yet.",5,0,1444688728,1444723966
cvxfc6y,0,t1_cvxf16s,noelsusman,"I think their wording is terrible because if you take it literally then in your 10 yard scenario he wouldn't be considered a runner which is obviously absurd.

I can see what you're saying in that he had some control of himself to dodge any incoming contact even though he was falling, which seems like it meets the spirit of the rule.  I think the fact that he got hit before he came down to the ground and never stopped falling kind of invalidates any amount of control he has while falling.

I think the key is that he never truly established himself as being upright and running after he got hit in the air, so he has to maintain possession through the entire tackle including when he hits the ground.  If he had stopped his fall to the ground and come up a bit for a step or two before lunging then it would have been a catch.

I think you make some good points though and I'm not entirely confident anymore that it shouldn't be considered a catch in theory.",5,0,1444687229,1444723966
