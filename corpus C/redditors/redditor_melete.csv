cvxshyi,0,t1_cvxrxep,melete,There are some REALLY bad games on Steam. Or just ones that have been bundled indiscriminately (may also be bad). Buying random Steam keys is very much not worth.,3,0,1444708246,1444730314

cvv3xgw,1,t3_3o90al,melete,"Cube/Blood Shards are super important to getting gear. Moreso than actual drops in the game.

Also, it's not a constant loot curve, once you get a reasonable level of gear you can do speed t8/t10/GRs and get a very high number of legendaries.",2,0,1444509615,1444730314
