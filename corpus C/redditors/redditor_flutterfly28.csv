The GOP can't use any of what Bernie is saying against Hillary or against the Democratic Party, as he is officially an Independent who doesn't represent anyone's views but his own. Ability to say whatever he wants with no consequences - perfect person to be #2 to Hillary. It's a win for the Democratic Party and for Bernie (who gets the attention of the #2 spot to start a movement that should in the long run help the Democratic Party). Just think about how much sense it makes.",1,1,1444712810,1444719623

> The Democrats have a master-plan this election and I am so grateful for it. They know that the policy/ideology differences within the Democratic party are miniscule compared to the great 'shut down the government'-level divide between the Democrats and the Republicans. After the last 6 years the Democrats know that political progress takes more than just the Presidency, [it takes a party](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/opinion/it-takes-a-party.html?_r=0).

All they have is Benghazi/Obamacare and each other. Watch them beat each other to the ground. No matter who is left standing (lol Trump), the party is in total disarray.
            
>If it hadn't been Hillary, the Democrats would have coalesced around another candidate. What better evidence of the strategy is there than the fact that the #2 spot is being securely held by a non-Democrat who has sworn not to run third-party and also sworn not to run a negative campaign? Elizabeth Warren would have been a better general election candidate, but she didn't run. Her run may have actually threatened Hillary/caused party infighting and nobody (including Warren/Sanders) wants that. Somebody has to be #2 to Hillary and Sanders is the perfect person to be it. He can bring up important issues, make overly idealistic/implausible proposals, and drum up enthusiasm for a more liberal Democratic party/candidate in the future. But the GOP won't even get anything out of attacking him because hey! he's not even really a Democrat.

I'm concerned that many of Bernie's ardent supporters on Reddit will immediately snap back into cynicism if Bernie does not win the nomination. Do you think this will be the case?
