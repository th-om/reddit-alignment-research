Or would it be both Obama and the Republican leadership that is forced to resign?",1,0,1444662339,1444718044
cvp097q,0,t1_cvoxez1,Huey_McDuck,"Well, that is why OP is a fan of having all women escorted by a male relative when they leave the house.  This way, its much harder to rape her.  

Also, OP must be a fan of women covering their faces and bodies, as temptation must be the reason that they are raped.   

If only women were escorted by male relatives and covered up all the time save in the house, we would all be much safer.

cvozxpk,0,t1_cvox672,Huey_McDuck,"Well, having someone rap at her is much less worse than being raped. 

But why should someone be forced to live in fear?  Why should the bad guys win automatically because no one can exert their civil rights?

If the statement was ""Well, black people are afraid of being attacked at polling places so they shouldn't vote"", I would hope that you would say that they need to vote.   That we need to increase security at polling places and that they should be able to appropriately defend themselves when they do vote.

I don't see a difference between the two, you are asking someone to surrender their freedoms and rights because you think that fear should rule the day. ",3,0,1444060061,1444718044

cvox2re,0,t1_cvowmm9,Huey_McDuck,"I think what they are trying to say is that any woman that walks alone, without a male relative with her, is asking to be raped.  Especially if she isn't covering her face and body to keep men from temptation.  

I can't see anything oppressive about having a culture where women are required to walk with a male relative everywhere in public with their face and body completely covered.",6,0,1444055065,1444718044
cvly7bc,0,t1_cvkyt81,Huey_McDuck,"I have to ask, how covert is it since we knew about it from the beginning?

Also, I disagree on how successful it is, as I remember right before Mosul, ISIS took over a group of warehouses without any firefights where they got like $500 to $700 million in US equipment.

The Soviets backed the Viet Cong but unlike the US involvement, they pretended to the world they weren't involved and were ""covert"".    The US had actual troops on the ground and known forces in Vietnam.
