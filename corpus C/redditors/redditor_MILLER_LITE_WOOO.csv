The biggest advantage to doing this on a national stage is the economies of scale that could/would come to fruition with having every single person under the same umbrella. 

Currently, the federal gov (through medicare) is forbidden from negotiating precription drug costs with big pharma. This is an entirely political construct that exists solely because lobbies are legally permitted to bribe public officials through campaign donations. If we take a common sense approach to healthcare (like, seriously, let's act like we're all in this together for a minute, because we are), eliminate artificial hurdles like the one mentioned, and actually let the market forces dictate what happens with pricing, then the economies of scale of having 100M people insured by some sort of single-payer system will certainly save money in the long run. 

One more point about artificial hurdles: the entire insurance industry is an artificial hurdles. We have a for-profit entity that sits between you and your doctor, and now it's legally mandated that he sits there (Thanks Obama), skimming a bit (lol, little) off the top of your bill. Why does he even need to be there in the first place? That's what advocates of a single payer system want to eliminate.",1,0,1444155100,1444716602

Skiing is an option and there are a few small smalll hills in the southeastern part of the state. It's no Vermont of Colorado, but skiing is a thing here.

cuwutj3,1,t3_3ke7bo,MILLER_LITE_WOOO,"Detroit (metro).  The automotive tech scene is a-booming right now, particularly in the infotainment/advanced safety/connected car scenes. Don't work for an OEM. You want to get into a Tier 1 if you actually like doing tech work. You go to an OEM when you're ready to be put out to pasture, but not quite ready to retire. 

Why you should move here? Job opportunities in automotive tech. We have an IKEA. Red Wings and Tigers are better than whatever shitty team in your current city. Cost of living is way better than the Bay Area.

Why you shouldn't? You're a pussy and can't deal with snow. You like to drive on roads that don't look like they came from the aftermath of a post-apocalyptic movie (because you're a pussy). You bought into the hype about Detroit being a wasteland.  You can't find good Cuban food (seriously, can anyone point me to a good Cuban restaurant? I'll drive anywhere in the metro for it).
