That's how Fox gets away with it.  It's news from a conservative viewpoint.  ",2,0,1444600078,1444724462
cvw8u4f,0,t1_cvw5p8y,countrykev,"The ownership model-cat was out of the bag a while ago, though.

Viacom/CBS already owns a number of television, radio, and cable stations.  They also own Paramount Pictures.  

Time Warner for a long time held a number of cable channels in addition to cable systems.  

Sure, Comcast has a lot, including broadcast, cable channels, and cable systems.  But there isn't really anything there that would make it such the monopoly that didn't already exist.",2,0,1444599863,1444724462
cvvzy5b,0,t1_cvvwmcw,countrykev,"Broadcasting Cspan over the air to local markets is way more expensive than cable.  By the way, that's how c span gets its funding, through carriage fees on cable.  It would be difficult to monetize the broadcasts.  Besides, they stream most of their programming and a lot of it gets archived so you can watch it later.

States like Florida make their state government channel available over the air as a sub channel on most public television stations in the state.  Others I know stream their programming such as Wisconsin.

I don't know where you get your news, but most local newscasts focus on local and state news and not national.   If you are tuning into cnn, you are not going to get state level stories because they have fifty states to broadcast to, so the focus is going to be on the big stories.",5,0,1444586241,1444724462
cvvq7kt,0,t1_cvvbwzo,countrykev,"Except it does.  In abduction cases it is entirely plausible the abductor hits the road.  Police canvas large swaths of area, particularly along major highways, to be on the lookout.  ",3,0,1444564740,1444724462
cvvq446,0,t1_cvv9dxx,countrykev,"I got it in Fort Myers.  They canvas a large part of the state because often times in abduction cases they hit the road.  Makes sense to push the alert to large areas along the interstate because they very well could be there. It is a ""Be on the lookout"" type of situation.",2,0,1444564366,1444724462

cvsnkpd,1,t3_3nzlak,countrykev,"Well, you bought it.  So, there's obviously a market for it.  

To say whether or not your home would be desirable in the future depends on so many variables.  There are generalities that do well, like updated kitchens, decent master bedroom/bathroom.  But homes come in all shapes and sizes, and there's a market for all of them.  

Besides, you could have the perfect home, priced right, but the market is so cold is doesn't sell for months.  Or you could have a home tremendously dilapidated sell for three times the asking price because a new 10,000 employee office complex opened three blocks over.   ",3,0,1444323233,1444724462
