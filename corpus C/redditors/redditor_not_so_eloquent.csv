Kudos to you for get them home safe, but don't get pissed at your parents for not buying that. ",70,0,1444622331,1444727682
cvvrcne,0,t1_cvvr0zj,not_so_eloquent,"Honestly, honestly...I was thinking the same thing. I really *should* be rooting for NA since I live in NA, but I also want teams to go that deserve it. If AHQ or FNC get booted out for C9 it would feel like an injustice. Not that C9 don't have great individual players but I feel like as a team they just aren't as composed. I feel like if they got past groups it would be because they found one play style they do really well, and not because they are a better team overall. 

But that's the way the game works, so if they do move on I won't be salty. ",1,0,1444568668,1444727682

cvvgmp5,1,t3_3o7mfj,not_so_eloquent,"As someone who considers themselves a Libertarian, these kind of ""all or nothing"" attitudes really bug me. There are some circumstances where libertarian principles just don't make sense. It's weird to me that anyone would consider one system of thinking is perfect, be it democrat, republican, or libertarian. Obviously, in this circumstance, libertarianism does shit all to help this lady or solve the problem. I think people are sometimes just too easily threatened when their belief system is challenged and become more unwilling to make compromises. ",3,0,1444533570,1444727682
cvvg0d0,1,t3_3o8wld,not_so_eloquent,"The most important thing I learned about making soup is that if you're going to put milk or heavy cream in there, either add it to the end orrrr bring the temperature of your soup up slowly (like, painfully slowly) and don't bring it to a full boil. Curdled dairy in soup is the worst and is an easy way to ruin an entire batch of food.

Also, if you're going to boil down your soup and reduce the liquid to make it creamier and richer in flavor, don't season it until the end. If it's seasoned perfectly when you start, it's going to be an over-seasoned mess by the time you're done reducing the liquid. 

edit: is this not helpful advice? I'm sorry r/cooking, I tried!",3,0,1444532361,1444727682
