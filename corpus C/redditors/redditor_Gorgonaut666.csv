>...Our Gear has an in-match Activation Cost. This is one of our best mediators to balance collection vs over-time stat growth. To use gear, you bring it into a match, and then you must collect and spend shards to activate that piece of Gear for the duration of that match. Generally, rarer gear with higher stats costs much more than common gear with average stats.

>So, while you might have a huge set of legendaries that you've collected from playing 1000 hours, you'll be paying a hefty shard cost to get that gear activated in-match. Someone who is running three commons will be able to activate very early for a longer (if smaller) benefit.

and

> I think you'll also see a number of more PvP-centric players loadout 3 commons / uncommons with 0 shard cost. They'll feel more like a FPS Perk loadout to them, and they won't have to fiddle with them in-match.

and

> We may eventually add some variants that let you activate multiple times for bonuses with durations, but for launch, all gear is pay once for the match. Next match you'll have to activate it again. 

and

>For some modes, a good team will probably want a player to focus on buildables / turrets to maintain mode control. For that, I would find a lower cost (probably uncommon / rare) piece of Gear with Shard gain bonuses on it to help me establish econ dominance to building and upgrading the buildable nodes. Then, run some a nice fat epic or legendary that adds bonuses to buildables I build. Yeah, we have those.

Which sounds a lot deeper that what I was imagining. Note that shards are an in-match currency collected from killing enemies and mining from larger shards in the environment (I assume most of you know this, but I didn't want anyone thinking there were microtransactions involved).",3,0,1444693949,1444724600

cvxewcx,0,t1_cvxclse,Gorgonaut666,"It's just such a terrible implementation. While, yes, it expanded coverage to a lot more people, everybody I know who has heath care through it has worse and more expensive coverage than they had before, and several of them have chosen the penalty fee instead because they could no longer afford it - all of them Democratic supporters of health care reform, all of them trying to hang on to the bottom edge of the middle class. Without a single payer option it's toothless, and the website is still barely functioning. 

It's a toe in the door, I suppose, but it needs to be *completely* overhauled. I feel like we can't talk about what a trainwreck the ACA is without bolstering the Republican argument, so I'm thrilled Sanders has remained critical of it.",1,0,1444686550,1444724600

People buy these passes with the expectation that they're still going to be just as excited about the game in a year as they are today, and that's rarely the reality of it. The slightly higher price of Ã  la carte purchasing far outweighs the potential risk of becoming disinterested with the game later and having already paid for content you don't care about.

I was curious if more conservative Democrats like Webb or an ex-Republican like Chafee might do anything for you. In a lot of ways, Sanders reminds me of the old 'Made in USA,' 'hunting on the weekend,' 'give to the poor' kind of Republicans from my youth. He's a clearly a lot more liberal on social policy than they were, but I can see how some of what he's saying can cross the partisan divide. ",3,0,1444616467,1444724600
