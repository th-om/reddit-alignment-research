cvxmd89,0,t1_cvxjq0k,toastymow,"Actually, when doublelift did his famous play, he was not an adc, but a support. This was WAAAAY back when he played on EPIK Gamer, a team with Dyrus, Dan Dinh, Westrice, and Salce. That team had Dyrus top (with flex to support or ADC if westrice wanted to play top lane corki or top lane akali, which were both meta back then), Dan Dinh Jungle, Salce Mid, Westrice ADC, and Doublelift Support (with flex to double bruiser bottom, where he played Garen and Lee Sin, even Poppy once I believe). 

The specific play that happened was doublelift was blue side and face checked his bush between the outer and inner mid on the lizard side. The entire enemy team was waiting and he instantly died. ",-1,0,1444698447,1444721994

cvxm5j3,0,t1_cvxemir,toastymow,"> Going over someone's head can be construed as ""taking the initiative"" here in the west,

It only works if you're not only right, but your right decision helps the company in some way. Fuck up, and you look not only incompetent, but potentially you're purposely going against orders from your superiors, you're sabotaging their efforts. 

In the East, it looks bad no matter what. Either you were right and you're seen as arrogant or prideful because you went over your boss' head, or you're wrong and you're see as incompetent and foolish, refusing to do what your superior ordered.

cvwoehn,0,t1_cvwir5y,toastymow,"Yes. 

Homme wasn't all that amazing. Solid, but no Marin or even Soaz IMO. 

Dandy, Dade, Imp, and Mata are all gods. But at that time they were young. Dade is and I think will always be, a player that will be slow to adapt to the meta, but devastating on signuature picks. Season 3 worlds, like the current worlds, saw a pretty massive meta shift between qualifiers and worlds occuring, and Dade couldn't adapt that well. 

I think Imp honestly hadn't reached his true potential, he would get his revenge next year by winning the entire thing.

Mata and Dandy were solid, but something you forget to mention is the lack of sygnergy between Dandy and Dade. This was something that Samsung very much emphasized when they rebuilt SSW and SSB. And I think, honestly, given the results, they were right. So yes, on paper, Ozone is a better team, but, the reality is that these players together didn't work out, specifically in that meta at that tournament. ",4,0,1444630031,1444721994
cvwiwnn,0,t1_cvwa3qt,toastymow,"Yes. The story was that C9 scrimmed GMB and FNC scrimmed Najin during S3 worlds. FNC and GMB then met up and told each other the other's entire P&B strategy. Very likely one of the reasons that C9 didn't suceed vs FNC (the other, was of course, not banning kassadin). ",4,0,1444617872,1444721994

cvvxjjr,0,t1_cvvwwcs,toastymow,"The advantage of weed for casual users is that its probably not that harmful, not because smoking is bad, but because the drug is more potent. A weed virgin can get 1 good hit and be stoned out of their mind. For me to that kind of high I probably have to take about 4x the amount of weed, and that high won't last more than maybe 30 minutes (I'll be high, but not crazy high). 

So for regular users, every day users, who have being using on a daily basis for months or years, that tolerance build up really fucks with them. But for casual users, its probably not that bad. 

At least, that's my unscientific theory. ",1,0,1444582287,1444721994
cvvlp9f,0,t1_cvvhjn3,toastymow,"Technically you're right. I think what the other posters have been getting at though is the same thing that occurs in the real world, especially in careers that attract people of a lower socio-economic status, is you get people who are either distrustful towards cops for reasons unrelated to their job, or people who are poorly educated and unaware of their rights, or people who don't have the financial means to litigate effectively in the event of violations occurring. 

So yes, in theory they can call the cops. But, would a crack-head (heck, just anyone who can't pass a drug test) who never graduated from high school and is a paycheck away from being evicted really be able to effectively pursue legal or work closely with the police to take down their employer in such an instance? I find that hard to believe. ",0,0,1444545568,1444721994
