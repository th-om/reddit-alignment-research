cvxd2l9,0,t1_cvxbe08,Younger_Gods,"Now, I'm biased, but how is Feilhaber not even remotely at Reyna's level?

He's been 1 of the best 3 players in the league the whole year, and he's been the best player in MLS over the past 18 months. You cannot tell me he isn't even ""remotely"" on the same level as Reyna. 

And that's not even taking into consideration Sacha's great run of form, and Nguyen seems streaky this year, but when he's in form there's few like him. ",-1,0,1444683796,1444717700
cvxb15g,0,t1_cvx8o3s,Younger_Gods,"> Reyna was also an attacking creative midfielder, which the US doesn't even have right now.

Not to insert myself in the middle of this convo you're having to nitpick, but how does either Benny Feilhaber, Lee Nguyen, or hell even now Sacha Kljestan not quality for that kind of role?",-2,0,1444680941,1444717700

I just realized how silly it would sound trying to explain that concept to someone who doesn't follow this league and it's byzantine roster rules closely. ",1,0,1444675920,1444717700

Do I think there's any chance of this being reversed anytime soon? No.

But good for her to come out and say this. I'd also like to point out this is just one of countless examples of differences between political parties, so if someone tries to feed you the ""both parties are the same"" BS, remember this.

EDIT: For the gun-nuts who downvote any anti-gun message on sight, how about explaining how my post detracts from the conversation. You won't, but at least it's on record.

At least Saad and Dia will try and move the ball forward. Conner looks frightened at the mere though of attacking. 

Really need to look for a winger w/ pace this off season. Someone who can stretch a D, ideally as a bench player.",1,0,1443976615,1444717700
