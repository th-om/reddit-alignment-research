It's all about fighting fires, and distributing aid during floods. But all anybody ever says afterward is, well yea but now the National Guard gets deployed, what a crock of shit.",0,0,1444335215,1444716586
cvq6xz4,0,t1_cvq6hxi,OpticalDelusion,"> What monopoly? What are you talking about?

Competition is a spectrum that goes from a true monopoly to perfect competition. So when I say the American healthcare industry is noncompetitive, that means that it is comprised largely of local monopolies and oligopolies, with the only exceptions being large urban centers.

Again, this is econ 101, so I'm not sure why I have to hold your hand through this if you've actually received an economics education - it should have been apparent from literally my first comment.

It's completely analogous to utilities, telecom, airlines, and even financial institutions. You have an industry with high barriers to entry (not including the barriers presented by government regulation). This creates a non-competitive market, which necessitates government regulation. This further increases the barriers to entry, but is necessary because there is no competitive pressure to innovate, cut costs, increase efficiency, etc.

Almost everything you learn about the economic theories underlying the free market and capitalism rely on perfect competition much in the same way that simplified physics theories rely on a frictionless vacuum. ",0,0,1444147182,1444716586

cvq2gsg,0,t1_cvq1vf7,OpticalDelusion,"The emergency care would be more incidental, you're right.

But think of socialized medicine looking to do population management - things like providing programs for smoking cessation and subsidizing healthy food markets in low-income areas. These things are great in places with socialized medicine because they reduce overall incidences of chronic diseases. Then someone is diagnosed with diabetes or lung cancer in a non-socialized state. These people now have to get more expensive treatment for the entire remainder of their lives compared to the cost of a system with preventative medicine. So they move and eventually satisfy residency requirements. You end up with essentially healthcare tourism.",1,0,1444139721,1444716586
