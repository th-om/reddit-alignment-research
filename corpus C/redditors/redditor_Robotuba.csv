Not really.  You kinda flipped when I tried to do that for you.  You should just do yourself.  ",2,0,1444548099,1444719329

No, you just aren't sure what standards you have.

I wouldn't require anyone to say they have been raped.  I was suggesting what I thought might be reasonable position for someone saying the things you were saying.  See, I didn't realize that you hadn't really thought out how the abortions you are OK with would work.  I was under the presumption that you were stating a position, but it seems you are looking for something to argue against rather than arguing *for* something.

I have no interest in limiting abortion to rape victims that are willing and able to fill out police reports.  That is a position that would not really allow rape victims the access they need.  ",2,0,1444531674,1444719329
