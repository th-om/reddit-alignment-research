ct69vck,0,t1_ct5yi3p,Earendyl,"I think there will almost certainly be some amount of money going to terrorist groups, supporting Assad, etc. Obama's argument isn't that removing sanctions won't allow Iran to funnel money to these organizations, it's that the sanctions regime was never going to be permanent anyway, Russia and China won't continue sanctioning Iran, hurting their own economies in the process, if Iran is willing to agree to give up nuclear weapons programs which was the point of the sanctions in the first place. So the options realistically aren't keep sanctions or lift them, the options are lift them as part of a deal or let the deal fail and then Russia and China stop sanctioning Iran and they get the money they wanted anyway and then the only option we're left with the stop Iran's nuclear program is military action",4,0,1437111391,1444729234

cos8nqq,1,t3_2wmj5w,Earendyl,"Obviously depends on your perspective but I think the fact that income inequality has become a top issue finally (to the point even republicans are talking about it) is a great thing.
