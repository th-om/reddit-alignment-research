cvwwe2u,0,t1_cvwjlhe,wsdmskr,"A. That was an every play danger, not a random accident like the Utley play.

B. That was the players' choice, not an edict passed down by MLB like the Posey rule or whatever comes from this. 

C. This isn't just about safety. It's also about agents and MLB protecting their assets.  

D. I said from the beginning, as someone who's watched the game for 30+ years, I prefer the old style of play. That's called an *opinion.*",4,0,1444658125,1444717696

cvwj291,0,t1_cvwidk1,wsdmskr,"It absolutely was how the game used to be played. For an indication of how it's played now, look at all the comments and  tweets by current Major Leaguers complaining about the play. The game has changed.

Most players these days don't give up their bodies for the takeout like Utley did in that play, which is why so many people are taken aback by his slide. That would have been just another day at the office in the '80's.
