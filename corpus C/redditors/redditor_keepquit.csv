Why can't it be both?  People rarely do things for rational reasons.  Would you be against someone putting a picture of a dead loved on in their house? I mean they should just be able to remember them.  Tattoos aren't worse than any other sentimental thing that people do.

As for the aesthetic argument, who cares? Being fat or smoking are going to do a lot more harm over 10 years than a faded tattoo.

 It's definitely worth trying to get back into fitness.  I honestly fell off the wagon for about a year, then got back into going to the gym for the last few months. The main thing I learned is don't get obsessed with fitness.  It will just burn you out in the long run.  Do smaller things that can form into a habits.  Then slowly build off those.",1,0,1444264000,1444727938
cvruymu,1,t3_3nw8ps,keepquit,"I have a strong inclination to be physically active. This is mostly due to upbringing, my parents always forced me into sports and both are pretty active. My mom at 60 rides her bike 60 miles a week and swims for 3-5 hours a week. 

I also try to look at least somewhat put together in terms of clothes. ",3,0,1444259208,1444727938
