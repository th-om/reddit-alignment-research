cvxthjp,1,t3_3o526n,periphery72271,"He was originally gender identified and genetically male when he was Norrin Radd and was heterosexually attracted to his monogamous mate, Shalla Bal.

Galactus transformed him into the Silver Surfer, and removed all emotions except those productive to being a Herald, so during that time he was asexual. His genetics were unique and he had no reproductive capability, so his sex wasn't relevant, however he maintained his gender identification as male.

Once he met the Fantastic Four and specifically Alicia Masters, his emotional psyche was restored and he became recquainted with the idea of love, and immediately pined for his own lost lover. Being that he was devoted to only her and thought her dead, he identified as heterosexual but remained celibate.

Eventually he would reconcile himself with the loss of his original partner and have heterosexual romantic relationships with gender identified females, such as Nova and Alicia Masters. He expressed the desire for physical intimacy, however he has never chosen to alter his form to accommodate those relationships, and it's not disclosed if any of those relationships were ever sexual in nature. 

In all honesty, Nova, was, like him, a Power Cosmically transformed entity who had no need for physical sexual stimulation, and Alicia Masters had been the previous partner of Ben Grimm, for whom a sexual relationship was an impossibility, making her very likely accustomed to being celibate if not actively asexual herself. Sex likely wasn't really a critical issue for either of them.

The simple truth is that he has the power to accomplish any desired result that could occur from sex without actually participating in it, so there is really no need for him to simulate genitalia. He can generate pleasure within himself or others telepathically or via directly manipulating the brain and share the pleasure of others with cosmic awareness, so it's arguable if physical sex would actually even compare. 

Regardless, he is currently he is in a monogamous romantic relationship with another gender identified female, Dawn Greenwood, much like his previous ones. The difference is now that he is assuming a form that is analogous to the one he held prior to his transformation. However, he is never not the Silver Surfer, so it's assumed he is using his matter manipulation powers to assume a form pleasing to his partner. There's no reason to believe sexual function is not part of that package. Dawn is certainly a hetero sexually active female identifying woman, and it's assumed that when called upon, the Silver Surfer will provide for her needs in the form she's accustomed to.",1,1,1444710213,1444717620

cvwqg8o,1,t3_3of7wd,periphery72271,"Have you *seen* Thor?

I imagine there are very few straight women on the planet who would not be at least a little bit interested in a man of his physique. 

Those that aren't probably are attracted to the fact that he is quite possibly the most powerful creature to grace the surface of the planet Earth.

...and is rich beyond measure.

...and knows thousands of years of Earth history by memory.

...and is intimately aware of dimensional physics and science so complicated it might as well be magic.

It's a slam dunk as to why Jane might like Thor.

As to Thor liking Jane? Well, she's smart, hot, sweet, and a generally good person who solves problems with her mind, some to him pretty primitive tools and a strong dose of determination, something which is probably pretty novel to him. She is representative of the best qualities of humankind, who he admittedly has a soft spot for.

It's really pretty much opposites attracting.",1,1,1444637214,1444717620

cvv7wtm,1,t3_3nhcgp,periphery72271,"Why do these men need a shelter, firstly?

Next, most people are not interested in enabling infantile pedophiles in any way shape or form, and the fact that you don't understand why kinda concerns me.

To explain, the activity is abhorrent to most people not to mention criminal, the mindset is alien, and any sort of activity regarding these men would have to be heavily tilted toward prevention and therapy for anyone to be remotely interested. 

I'm also entirely unsure you would attract any clientele to your 'shelter' that is not already convicted of molestation, as the stigma for people of this persuasion is massive. 

I guess I would suspect your motives first and secondly want to measure that you did not unintentionally end up enabling the behavior society wants prevented. 

You would have equally as little interest in shelters for people who want to steal, or murder -  the risk is great that all you'd get is a bunch of better thieves and murderers. ",1,0,1444517017,1444717620
cvqzvez,0,t1_cvqtu3c,periphery72271,"If you then troll them and strand them out of combat range/ out of bounds kill them, yes, it's your fault.

It's a boat with 4 combat stations. Anytime you board it there may be 3 other players, supposedly there to make the vehicle more combat effective, that may join it with you regardless of your plans.

Now you can accept that fact and work around it for the global goal (victory), or you can be a selfish twat and demand that others allow you to go joyriding with a valuable combat resource for your own reasons thereby lessening the entire team's chances of winning.

Nothing stops you from taking the selfish twat route, just don't expect to be applauded for it, as it's completely opposite of the purpose of the scenario. Particularly vindictive teammates may even punish you for your doucehbaggery and you will get a taste of your own medicine, like the OP.

cvqnul8,0,t1_cvpzw80,periphery72271,"So edgy.

And its me who needs to get over myself. Right.

Ad homs aside, nobody was going to be harmed if the race was interfered with. I myself wouldn't advocate violence of any kind, ever, and wouldn't support anyone who did.

Nobody's lives were at risk, no matter what hyperbolic claims people try to advance to the contrary. 26.2 miles becomes 26, and a bunch of people sit/lay where some other people wanted to run.

What makes me curious is why people get so emotionally invested that they'll go through such efforts- twisting reality, representing a protest into a potential riot/massacre-via-dehydration...for what? To win a rhetorical point on Reddit? Or is the reality of BLM so abhorrent to them that they'll try anything to make them look bad? I dunno, but it seems slightly silly and petulant to me.

I know why I'm emotionally invested in this particular form and outlet for protest. I'm interested in what drives people to be so vehemently against it. Unless people really do believe that runners were going to die of dehydration and that any protest group who casus disreuption is fomenting riot, every time. 

At that point, I'd have to question who exactly truly is naive here. ",0,0,1444172548,1444717620
