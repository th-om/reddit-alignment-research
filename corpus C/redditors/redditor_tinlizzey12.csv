Well the idea of invading Iraq based on lies was a bad idea, that can't be blamed on Islam, especially since Saddams' regime was *secular*

And I wonder how ""bad"" the ""ideas of Islam"" (whatever that means) can be, considering that the ISLAMIC republic of Iran is showing the US how to take better care of its poor:http://www.aarp.org/health/doctors-hospitals/info-06-2010/iranian_cure_for_thedeltas_blues.html

And in fact after the ISLAMIC revolution in Iran, people massively improved their living standards and even gained an additional 22 years of life span:http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2013/apr/01/un-stats-life-longer-and-healthier-iran

Remember, 'vat-loads of anthrax' or 'mobile biological labs'? 

None of that was true.

The British understood this well and concluded that in Washington, ""the intelligence and facts are fit around the the policy"" as described in the Downing Street Memo
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/12/AR2005051201857.html

In fact President Bush and Colin Powell were both specifically warned that the claims about Iraq seeking ""Yellowcake from Niger"" was also false, but they asserted the claim publicly anyway...and Karl Rove tried to discredit the intelligence officials who came up with that conclusion -- this was the famous ""16 Words/Valerie Plame"" affair https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plame_affair

And ironically, the *same people* who were responsible for that mess, tried to start *another war* in the Mideast, this time an attack on Iran, under the *similar* pretext of a non-existent ""Iranian nuclear threat""
