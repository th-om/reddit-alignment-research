cvxravv,0,t1_cvxqtgt,HippeHoppe,"> I think that a really good test of the morality of a particular government action is to simply imagine that action being performed by a private individual(s). If one finds the action performed by private individual(s) morally impermissible, then by the law of moral universalism, one must find the same action performed by public individual(s) morally impermissible.

This presupposes that the state does *not* have political authority, though. The argument would go that the state has different moral rights and duties than do people on account of the state's having political authority. The state may coerce you into, say, providing charity - your neighbors may not.

>However, you will be hard-pressed to find someone who truly does not believe that moral rules should be universal. No sane, rational human being would accept the proposition that rape is wrong, except if the woman is attractive.

I don't think that you really will have a hard time finding people who reject moral universalism. In fact, the vast majority of people I meet are, *at least in some respects*, moral relativists (""morality depends on culture"") - this is not the case of most ethicists, we should note. The classic example given by Herodotus, for instance, concerns the differences of the Greeks and Callatians regarding the disposal of the dead: the Greeks cremate their parents, but the Callatians cannibalize them. Both cultures think that their own practice is best and find the other abhorrent.

A consistent relativist (which is the politically correct view to take today) would say that the right moral practice depends on the society in which one lives. I think plenty of people will accept this line of reasoning (even though it's wrong); plenty of people will also accept that, for instance, parents have different rights and duties than do their children (and that parents have authority over their children which entitles them to these rights and duties). Very *few* people actually think that ethics are universal.

>P.S. Your section on the critiques of individualism is very enlightening.

cvxo9ux,1,t3_3of7hu,HippeHoppe,"Great prompt! I think that the justification of political authority/legitimacy is one of the most fascinating questions in philosophy (not just moral and political philosophy), so I love to see this thread! I'll give my thoughts on some of the traditional justifications for political authority, what I think their problems are, and how convincing I find them. I should preface this by saying that I am a moral individualist (I mean by this that I begin moral philosophy with individual agents as the most fundamental unit of analysis - I'll address at the end why I think moral individualism might be the weakest part of my argument against political authority), a [stoic propertarian](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/3kmqru/iama_deontological_anarchocapitalist_ama/cv30wxc) (so I am a virtue ethicist, and property rights and contract play an important part in my ethics), and I'm an anarchocapitalist (so I reject political legitimacy/authority). I think defending propertarianism or Neostoicism is too large an issue to cover in this post, but I linked my more extensive defense earlier in this paragraph.

**Consequentialist Justifications of Political Legitimacy**

Right off the bat, I'm *not* a consequentialist, and I don't think that it's obviously the case that the state is better from a consequentialist standpoint than no state anyway. But neither of these issues is really interesting for this thread. I think the more interesting question is why exactly a consequentialist justification *for the state* implies a consequentialist justification for the state's *legitimacy* (or the duty of citizens to obey the state).

Let's stipulate that Hobbes is right and the state really *is* necessary to avoid total social collapse - from a consequentialist point of view, that's a decent justification for the state's existence. For utilitarians, it's probably even a reason why you can't challenge the state - you can't set up a competing state and try to overthrow it, because that risks a collapse into disorder. But this is really only an argument for why citizens have a duty to respect the authority of the state insofar as doing so is necessary for the state's continued function in preventing social collapse (e.g., you can't start a civil war). It's not an argument for why you ought not do simply disobey the law when doing so does *not* threaten the state's vital function (say in, say, jaywalking).

Well, one might object that if *everyone* did so (disobey 'minor' laws), then we really *would* see total social collapse. Even if this is the case, the 'marginal impact' of your individual choice to break the law on state legitimacy is negligible. Unless we're rule consequentialists (which - albeit I'm not well-read in rule consequentialism - seems like a completely incoherent view to me), then it's clear that there's no real duty to obey.

**Justice of Laws Themselves**

Short reply, but some people may say that we have a duty to obey the laws because these laws are justified in their own right (this is why we have a corresponding right - even duty - to disobey laws if they are not justified). But if the law is justified in virtue of the command of the law itself (and not in virtue of the *commander* who promulgates the law), then wouldn't we be obligated to obey the law even if there were no commander? A law which says ""You ought not rape"" is clearly justified (at least in most of our views) whether or not there exists a state to promulgate it. Additionally, it lends no legitimacy to the state itself, as the legitimacy of the law isn't *intrinsic* to the state (a stateless grouping of two people would still be bound by moral duties to not rape), and its legitimacy doesn't extend 'beyond itself' to the rest of the state's functions (the state can still do unjust things, and these aren't justified in virtue of the state promulgating a just law). So the state's moral authority here isn't *content-independent*: the things the state is justified in doing are justified in their own right, not because the state is doing them.

**Compact theories of government**

Naturally, as a libertarian-propertarian, I should find appeals to compact theories of state legitimacy most convincing, but I actually think these are some of the worst arguments for the state. The explicit social contract is probably the least compelling case for state legitimacy I can imagine. Oftentimes, the libertarian response is caricatured as ""I didn't sign no social contract!"", and while I think that this *is* a common and immature response, it does seem like the obvious (and true) answer to the most basic form of contractarianism. It seems to me to obviously be the case that the standard narrative justification that ""Everyone thought (note the past tense) the state was a good idea, so they joined in social contract for mutual benefit, and this implies the state has certain rights and citizens have duties to obey"" is patently untrue. It not only appeals to a past historical occurrence which may or may not have occurred (in almost all cases, it did not), but it's unclear why a past or present agreement of some group of individuals would justify state actions which potentially violate the rights of individuals today who do not consent to that agreement.

My libertarian counter-argument relies on the assumption that an individual's rights are *logically* and *morally* prior to the state - not that they are necessarily practically respected without a state (say, you may get mugged if there is no state, but this isn't a reason why your right to your body and property is logically dependent on the state; this in the same way that, if you are not in the captivity of a slavemaster, you may be killed, but your right to your life doesn't depend logically on the protection of the slavemaster). Again, this is because I take the individual to be the most basic unit of moral analysis - I think the most compelling argument against stateless libertarianism is a (historically conservative) critique of individualism (deny that the individual really is the most basic unit of analysis).

More sophisticated versions of the social contract are obviously more of a challenge to deal with, but I haven't found many of them very compelling. The Kantian justification of the legitimacy of the state might be, in my view, the best case amongst the ""contractarians"" (although it's really not a question of voluntary assent to the state itself - the laws of the state are justified on *possible* assent, but the state itself is justified based on a pre-contractual moral duty to form a commonwealth). I still have to give it more thought and research, because I don't want to give a premature and poorly formulated response, but I'm not totally convinced either way.

**Critiques of Individualism**

The common 'problem' of state legitimacy - especially but not exclusively amongst libertarians (but also all those who generally follow in the tradition of European liberalism, which is to say almost all philosophers) - is as follows: individuals have certain rights by virtue of being persons, and these rights need to be protected. The state is the means by which these rights are protected, but this requires a circumvention of some freedoms (or rights) for the sake of protecting others (e.g., the state confiscates property through taxation in order to finance a military, which protects *greater* rights or freedoms from threat of invasion). So the question, really, is how we can justify circumventions of certain rights or freedoms, given that some people might actually not assent to this, *and* what the appropriate 'balance' is between rights protected and rights sacrificed.

This is a paradigm of moral individualism: it begins moral reasoning with the assumption that there are individuals *simpliciter* (generic, abstract persons) with rights, and everything proceeds from there. But what if we don't grant that assumption? Seems crazy from the point of view of the moderns, but I think this is a really challenging point to deal with. What if we begin our analysis with the *state* as a given, *then* proceed to try to justify individual rights and freedoms in virtue of their relationship to the state? This is sort of a ""Copernican Revolution"" (or a reaction, as this is a common pre-modern view) in ethics, where we switch the perspective of morality altogether.

People, after all, aren't just ""persons"" in some abstract sense: they're born into particular historical conditions, the way they think and relate to one another is shaped by these conditions (culture, geography, climate, politics, etc.). All of these things are not only *causally* necessary to bring you about to who you are today (in the sense that nutrients and sunlight bring an acorn into a tree), but they're also what caused you to develop into your current state (eleventh century Frenchmen think about the world differently than do 21st century Americans).

I'm not really persuaded by this critique of individualism, but I do think it's a really hard issue to tackle, and it can potentially upset the whole way we think about state legitimacy.",11,0,1444701352,1444725022
cvxk7vh,0,t1_cvwojqq,HippeHoppe,"Yeah, it's definitely not a critical theory interpretation of the French Revolutionary. It's more historical analysis than anything else. I *did* write a paper last year offering something sort of like a 'critical theory' interpretation of the failure of the French Revolution based on the philosophy of Max Stirner and some subsequent Stirnerian writers, along with some conservative critics of French revolutionary liberalism. If you're looking for Stirnerian or conservative criticism of the revolution, I can give some recommendations, but that's about it. I think it does sort of deal with the type of thing you're talking about, as much of the paper was based on how the belief in the volonté générale, abstract reason, universal morality, and republican virtue taken altogether necessitated the Reign of Terror and wars of revolution (this is *not* Jonathan Israel's view - he basically thinks that everything was great under the laissez-faire liberals until Robespierre and his socialist friends came and wrecked everything).

I combined the Stirnerian criticism with traditionalist conservatives, but Stirner's by no means a conservative author (in fact, the vast majority of Stirnerians are radical socialists and anarchists... **not** Marxists - Stirner and Marx hated one another -, but plenty of post-Marxist communists, like Deleuze and Guattari, were influenced by Stirner). So it may be useful.",1,0,1444695115,1444725022
cvxjsqc,0,t1_cvwxm5s,HippeHoppe,"Sure! I wrote an essay for one of my courses last year on a topic which dealt with the intellectual origins of the French Revolution, so I'd love to talk about it! Israel starts out by criticizing the prevailing historical treatment of the origins of the revolution, which seems to fall into two camps. 

(1) First, a lot of historians seem to say that the revolution was essentially moderate, and that it basically got ""out of control"" in responding to crises - the vast majority of France was conservative, and even the vast majority of revolutionaries were moderates, so why is it that things got radicalized? Because times were scary! Israel disagrees with this view: although the vast majority of France and revolutionaries were pretty moderate, the intellectual *leadership* which spearheaded the revolution and controlled the assembly were radical liberals. So he's already running against the historical grain here. Note that he doesn't discount structural/material factors as playing a causal role in enabling the revolution or the domination of the radicals, but he doesn't think that the revolution just sort of progressively slipped into radicalism - there were radicals from the start (many advocating revolutionary liberalism for decades before 1789), and they played a dominant role from the start.

(2) Second, a lot of historians seem to adopt a pretty reductionist view of the revolutionaries, ""ascribing the Revolution to an undifferentiated *philosophie* modern"" that ""[fails] to focus on the particular current embodying the main revolutionary tendency"" (p.18). We think of the French revolutionaries as ""Enlightenment revolutionaries"" without regard for what that really means - the Enlightenment included a lot of people with pretty diverse views. Robespierre was unquestionably an ardent revolutionary (""The Incorruptible""), but was hated by many equally radical revolutionaries. So ""[i]t was not Enlightenment philosophy generally, only a certain kind of philosophy that was responsible"" (18).

The Revolutionary Republicans were the left-wing faction which dominated the assembly, even though they were a smaller group than the aristocrats, constitutional monarchists, and Orléanists (moderate liberals). The *Jacobins* were themselves divided between the liberal democrats and the constitutional monarchists, and the *far* smaller faction of left-authoritarians (who were powerful only because they had control of the press and could routinely stir up the Parisian mob into intimidating the other factions).

Here's the really controversial part: Israel divides the revolutionary ""Left"" into two main camps. First is *La Montagne* (""The Mountain"", so named for its position on the highest rows of the National Assembly), who are the ""left authoritarians"" - they advocated what basically amounted to a totalitarian state, radical egalitarianism (notably, the Montagnards were not sympathetic to the rights of women, however), and were far more violent than the other factions. Robespierre and St. Just fall into this faction. Their violence wasn't just directed at reactionaries, we should note: they executed plenty of radical liberals like Brissot, Gorsas, Kersaint, and Carra (Condorcet was also a *persona non grata* in this camp).

In 1791, the Jacobin Club split into two separate factions - liberals known as the ""Friends of The Constitution"", later known as *Feuillants*, broke away from the left-authoritarians (the Feuillants numbered over two-hundred deputies of the assembly, so the left-authoritarians were left pretty much powerless). The Feuillants seized power and tried to stamp out the authoritarian left republicans remaining in the Jacobin party through press restrictions, but their power collapsed due to poor harvests, political instability, and military failures from 1791-1792: notably, the remaining Jacobins were able to instigate war against Austria and the German states in order to shore up political support for the hard left.

The non-Montagnard members of the French left were a pretty diverse group: it's not true to say that they were *all* 'moderate liberal monarchists' (Israel certainly doesn't believe this), but it's also not the case that they were all liberal republicans either. Still, during the early stages of the Republic, the dominant political ideology was something akin to laissez-faire libertarianism.

This isn't something that Israel explicitly argues in-depth, but it's something I've done other research on. Jean-Pierre Hirsch, for example, argues that ""[Revolutionary] France was probably the first country where 'laissez-faire' was officially accepted by the state"" (1281). In addition to emancipating Jews and Protestants, allowing civil divorce, ending the slave trade, and abolishing old privileges (Israel 11-12), the early Jacobins encouraged internal mobility of labor and capital (Boff 441) by removing restrictions on travel, refused to intervene during business cycles (439-440), denied subsidies to failing industries (441), limited the welfare state only to the provision of basic sustenance to those unable to work (442-443; notably, France had a centralized welfare state as opposed to the English parish system - this isn't to say that the English system was supported by voluntary contributions though: Britain had mandatory tithes, where France did not; France's welfare state was notably very stingy by comparison. In 1791, the French Assembly went so far as to ""abolish all the administration of trade and machinery of the law"" (Hirsch 1286).
