cvhhsuf,0,t1_cvhgsyn,CutOffUrJohnson,"Yeah you're right. I originally misread this part and it made the plan seem ultra progressive and my view of Trump as a blue collar populist confirmed it for me.

> The Trump plan eliminates the income tax for over 73 million households. 42 million households that currently file complex forms to determine they donâ€™t owe any income taxes will now file a one page form saving them time, stress, uncertainty and an average of $110 in preparation costs. Over 31 million households get the same simplification and keep on average nearly $1,000 of their hard-earned money.

On viewing the tax brackets it really isn't that progressive, as I misread $150K for $1.5M and didn't notice he was preserving some deductions for the top tax brackets. 

 That quick skim tho.",1,0,1443484179,1444724722
cvhcxua,0,t1_cvh5atd,CutOffUrJohnson,"This is what flashed through my head:

Bad: No carbon tax. No consumption tax. Doesn't eliminate corporate taxes. Keeps mortgage interest rate deductions. Claims about revenue neutrality are farfetched. Where's the EITC?

Good: Lowers corporate rates, more progressive.

To be fair, nobodies tax plan is great AFAIK.",1,0,1443475916,1444724722

Is crying during movies bad economics?",4,0,1443413253,1444724722
