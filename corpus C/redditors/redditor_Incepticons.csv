My first instinct after the really close game was over was to look for the post game thread because it honestly felt like a playoff game, I was a little bummed there wasn't one but I really wanted to see everyone's reactions. 

I really think the PGT will be a success! ",7,0,1444702736,1444723883

Unfortunately I'm seeing the screen that non-premium users are seeing because apparently they can't take any more payments right now. So I just paid for a full year and now I can't watch nor contact anyone about it :(",2,0,1444695951,1444723883
