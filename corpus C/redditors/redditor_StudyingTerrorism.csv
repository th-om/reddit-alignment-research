cvwwq9q,1,t3_3ofwq8,StudyingTerrorism,"Like all things in international politics, there were several reasons for the Obama administrations decision to call for the removal of Bashar al-Assad. Some of them made more sense when the civil war started in mid-2011 than they do now. 

### Ending the War

The Obama administration sees the presence of Assad as a leading reason for the Syrian Civil War's continued fighting. And it is probably a correct assessment. By removing Assad, the opposition would no longer have a reason to continue the war and the reconciliation process can begin, thus Syria can begin to rebuild. It sound ridiculous now with such a fractured opposition in Syria, but back in 2011, 2012, and maybe even early 2013, the moderate rebel fighters made up the bulk of the major opposition force. But even today, a major reason that Syrians are joining the opposition is because they wanted to remove the Assad regime. In fact, many of those fighters in groups like Ahrar ash-Sham or Jabhat al-Nusra joined because those groups were effective at fighting against Assad more than a shared ideology. In fact, it is probably the only thing that the entire opposition can agree on. Although removing Assad definitely won't end the violence in Syria, it will be a necessary first-step. 

Perhaps there was a time earlier in the conflict when it would have been possible for Assad to stay, so long as he made significant changes to the Syrian political system. But with so many Syrians that have been forced from their homes, wounded or killed by pro-government forces, it is now nearly impossible for Assad to remain in power over all of Syria. The fact that most Syrian refugees heading to Europe are not fleeing ISIL, but [instead the Syrian military](http://www.dw.com/en/survey-leaves-no-doubt-syrians-are-fleeing-assad/a-18775789), should give you an idea of how divisive Assad's rule is.  

### Geopolitical Benefits

Syria is a major ally and partner to two of the United States' adversaries--Iran and Russia--and removing Assad means removing a vital partner for both states. In the case of Iran, Syria acts as a conduit for weapons, arms, and advisors that Iran sends to Hezbollah in Lebanon. You may remember hearing of [Israeli airstrikes](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/world/middleeast/syria-says-it-was-hit-by-strikes-from-israeli-planes.html) against Hezbollah in Syria over the course of the war; this is a small example of that. Although removing Assad still wouldn't prevent Iran from supplying Hezbollah entirely (many weapons and equipment are sent via cargo ships), it would make it a lot harder. Additionally, it would undercut Iran's attempt to expand its influence in the region. Since the Arab Spring, Iran has been increasing its funding of Shia groups all across the Middle East in what is known as the [""Shia Crescent""](http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21647367-shia-militias-are-proliferating-middle-east-shia-crescendo). 

For Russia, removing Assad would also remove the last strong pro-Russian state in the Arab World, or at least significantly weaken it depending on what the post-Assad leadership looks like. Syria and Russia have had a very friendly relationship for several decades, mainly due to economic and political ties developed over the Cold War. With Putin trying to use Syria as a means to reestablish Russia as a great power that can conduct military operations beyond its neighboring countries, removing Assad would be a great blow to those plans. 

### Democracy and Human Rights

Although these things do not play a major role in foreign policy, in the case of Syria, democratic and human rights values do play some minor role. You have to remember, the unrest in Syria started during the Arab Spring, when dictators across the Middle East were being confronted with massive pro-democracy movements. The presidents/dictators in Tunisia and Egypt had already been forced from power in the months before and it seemed like this was a chance for Obama to get on the right side of history early (especially after his wavering and ambiguous messages towards Mubarak). 

When the protests in Syria turned into a war because the Syrian military started using extreme violence against the protesters, it only solidified the calls for Assad to go. The list of war crimes and crimes against humanity that the Assad regime has committed is well-documented, extensive, and long. The thinking behind many in Washington (and many other countries around the world) was that a leadership that attacks their citizenry with such brutality cannot be allowed to remain in power. While the United States has never shied away from supporting brutal dictators in the past, in Syria's case it makes no sense to support Assad (especially considering the other two major factors above).",16,0,1444658824,1444723255
cvwaeg7,0,t1_cvw7l9p,StudyingTerrorism,"Ya, that is very conspiracy theorist-y. Before you go just ""believing"" things about the CIA, or any other intelligence agency for that matter, you should read up more about the agency and the intelligence field. The thing about intelligence agencies is that most people just don't understand how they work, what their internal dynamics are, how they interact with other government agencies, where they fall in the government organizational structure, and what their limitations are. If you are interested in learning more, I would recommend reading some of the books listed in the [CIA's Suggested Reading List](https://www.cia.gov/library/intelligence-literature). There is also the AFIO's [Guide to the Study of Intelligence](http://www.afio.com/40_guide.htm), which can provide more information on intelligence in general (though whoever designed that site should be fired). There is a lot of literature out there which can help explain how the CIA operates and will likely provide you with greater clarity on the field as a whole.

But to answer your question: No, the CIA has no ability to direct policy, either towards the embargo or any other foreign policy issue. The fact that the embargo remains in place can be attributed primarily to two factors: 1) the older Cuban-Americans who are a sizable voting bloc in Florida and oppose any lifting of the embargo an will vote against candidates who suggest doing so (which you mentioned), and 2) a lack of political inertia among the general American populace to lift it.",2,0,1444602478,1444723255
cvw4ygn,0,t1_cvw0o01,StudyingTerrorism,"I would doubt that many members of the CIA actual think that their operations in Cuba will depend on the status of the embargo. If anything, dropping the embargo would allow for greater penetration of Cuba because there would be more reasons for U.S. citizens to be present and develop relationships with the locals. Additionally, Cuba hasn't really been that high of a national security priority since the end of the Cold War. There are several other locations that present more pressing threats to regional security--such as Venezuela, Colombia, or Brazil--that are more likely to divert the budget for ""Cuban ops"" as you call them. 

But like u/00000000000000000000 said, the CIA does not direct or develop policy. Their job is to collect information and produce intelligence for the policy makers, specifically the President . Even if there was a hypothetical portion of the CIA that does not want the embargo lifted, they have no way of actually making sure that it doesn't. ",1,0,1444593823,1444723255
cvvvttr,1,t3_3oazqh,StudyingTerrorism,"Counterfactuals are always difficult to determine accurately because by their very nature they are going to be driven by assumptions, speculation, and guesswork. We don't know exactly what would happen if Allawi became the Iraqi PM in 2010; the situation in Iraq could be better, worse, or the same. That having been said, allow me to take off my political scientist hat for a second and speculate the crap out of it. 

> How exactly would this have affected post-2010 U.S.-Iraqi relations? 

This is an interesting question, because even though Maliki was a major sectarian and the cause for a lot Iraq's problems today, he was still seen as ""our man"" back in 2010. Maliki was cooperative in the Surge operations and even deployed Iraqi Security Forces against the Mahdi Army in Basra and in Sadr City. So even though it seems obvious now that Maliki was the wrong choice, it wasn't so obvious back in 2010. 

If the U.S. put enough pressure on Maliki to shut up and allow Allawi to form a government (and assuming he is successful) after the elections in 2010, Maliki would have probably been a major spoiler in the following months or years. It's unlikely that we would have seen a return to 2006 levels of violence, but I would not be surprised if a bunch of Shia militias aligned with Maliki started making trouble or if the Mahdi Army returned (it disbanded after 2008). The United State would have likely continued the same policies it did under Maliki, such as switching to an advisor role. The United States still might have withdrawn in 2011, as that was more an issue with the Obama administration than with the Iraqi government. If the Iraqis requested that the United States not withdraw entirely there would probably still be a small contingent of U.S. troops in Iraq. However, I doubt it would be any larger than 3,500 (more likely closer to 1,000) troops. 

Part of the issue with the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq was not just the military withdrawal, but also the diplomatic withdrawal. President Bush used to call the Iraqi PM everyday during his term, which some have speculated is why Maliki was cooperative with the United States during the Surge years. President Obama, on the other hand, did not dedicate the time and resources to engage diplomatically with the Iraqi government, both personally and on a larger organizational level. This distancing from Iraq only increased after 2011. I find it highly unlikely that the United States would have dedicated more diplomatic effort towards an Allawi government. 

It is likely, however, that U.S.-Iraqi relations under Allawi would be better than under Maliki. From what I understand, Maliki had to constantly be pressured to not play sectarian favorites and be sure to bring the Sunnis into the political fold. An Allawi government would likely not have that issue. He was an Iraqi first and a Shia second; Maliki is very likely the other way around. An Iraqi government run by Allawi post-2010 would have been much easier for the United States to deal with. 

> How exactly would this have affected developments in Iraq, in Syria, and in other parts of the Middle East and Arab World after 2010?

This is a much more difficult question, because it relies on external factors that are difficult to judge. But I'm gonna speculate anyways. 

Iraq would not be in the same state that it is today. That I am fairly confident of. ISIL would probably still exist, but it would be in a much weaker form than it is today. Much of the support that ISIL gets from the Sunni populations (when it is not demanding it under threat of death) is due to the heavy pro-Shia policies and heavy-handed responses to Sunni protests that Maliki implemented. If Allawi was PM, these policies would not have been implemented and ISIL would be much weaker than it is today, though it  would still be present in Syria as well. Part of the reason that ISIL was able to take so much territory is that they could use Iraq as a safe staging area for operations against Syrian rebel positions into Syria. Once they established a sizable foothold, then ISIL could turn its focus back on Iraq. But with an Iraq under Allawi, ISIL would be less likely to establish itself across a broad section of both countries. 

Syria would still be in a civil war. In order to ensure that Iraq did not get dragged into it, Allawi would probably take a neutral stance towards the conflict. Borders would be more closely monitored for foreign fighters entering/leaving Iraq (though many would likely get through; its a big border). There would be a large Syrian refugee population in Iraq that would likely stress the Iraqi system, both in economic and security terms. It would probably be very similar to Lebanon in that respect. Unfortunately, Allawi lacked a lot of the political acumen that Maliki had, so it is also likely that Allawi would be struggling to keep Iraq together as the Syrian conflict spilled over. 

Iraqi-Iranian relationships would probably still be stronger, though I doubt they would have been as strong as they were under the Maliki regime, and likely not too strong to cause much of a major political storm in the United States. Relations with other Sunni Arab states would also likely be better; since Allawi was more of a secularist and non-sectarian, he would be less likely to forge stronger ties with Iran, which would help build stronger relationships with the GCC states and Jordan. 

In terms of Syria itself, I am not sure how the conflict would be right now. Without a strong ISIL in Syria, the moderate rebels would definitely be in a better position than they are today, especially in the east. However, many of the moderate rebels' problems stemmed from internal command and control issues, which means that they would still be weaker compared to some of the other opposition groups . The Syrian government would not have an Iraq that would be as cooperative as the Maliki administration was. This means that Iran would have a harder time delivering arms and men to Syria for the Assad government since they would have to have the cooperation of Iraq to use its airspace. Hezbollah would likely still be a major player for Assad, as well as some Iraqi Shia foreign fighters. Jabhat al-Nusra would probably still split with its original funder, ISI, but it may be in a stronger position and remain as a popular destination for extremist foreign fighters. Overall, I think you would still see a very bloody Syrian Civil War, but one that is more contained and with a weaker ISIL presence. 

And if you are interested, the New York Times Magazine ran an article on Allawi back in 2011 entitled [Iraq's Last Patriot](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/magazine/06ALLAWI-t.html?_r=0). It may help give you a better idea of the man and what he was capable of. ",4,0,1444579173,1444723255

cvurwgo,1,t3_3o7hqb,StudyingTerrorism,"This is a very disturbing development, both in terms of scale and in terms of timing. If memory serves, this is the single deadliest terrorist attack in Turkish history. More disturbing that the death toll is that fact that this attack occurred at a pro-peace rally that was advocating for the government and the PKK to stop fighting and that bombs struck mostly supporters of the HDP, the pro-Kurdish political party. The HDP has been advocating for an end to the violence since it started, and has denounced the PKK throughout it. This attack also came a day after reports that the PKK was ready to unilaterally return to the ceasefire, although those calls were dismissed by President Erdoğan who said he would only accept it if the PKK also turned in their weapons. 

What comes next depends largely on how Turkey's political leaders. One of the key people to watch is Selahattin Demirtaş, the co-head of the HDP. After the previous attacks on Kurds and HDP rallies, he has appealed for calm and dissuaded his supporters and other Kurds from engaging in violence themselves. However, this attack is far more symbolic and far deadlier than any of the previous ones, and he already seems to be losing his patience. This attack will likely result in the PKK withdrawing any proposals for a ceasefire and has the potential to galvanize some Turkish Kurds to throw their support behind the PKK. And while the HDP will likely continue to advocate for nonviolence and peaceful protests, people can only suffer so long before they move to other means to ensure their security. The political leadership in Turkey will need to move quickly to both tamper down any calls for violence as well as finding the individuals responsible for the attack f they want to prevent an escalation of the Government-PKK conflict.

cvtueae,0,t1_cvtib6b,StudyingTerrorism,"> they are the Taliban

That's a very disingenuous way of describing the mujahideen. While some elements later joined the Taliban, which was a separately created organization outside of the original mujahideen forces, many did not or were active combatants against the Taliban through the 1990s and early 2000s. There were seven designated groups that received U.S. and Saudi funding through the ISI, and only a portion would end up joining the Taliban.

> Note that the story also mentions Abdullah Azzam as being an ally of the US

This is the absolute first time that I have ever heard of Abdullah Azzam being considered an ally of the United States. While Azzam did set up fundraising centers in about 33 cities the United States, I have never seen any evidence that it was facilitated or done with the approval of the United States. Furthermore, the article seems to be conflating the Service Bureaus/Offices in Pakistan with other funding efforts. The Service Bureaus were mostly independent of any government funding, focused on supporting Arab mujahideen, and largely relied on the largess of Osama bin Laden; what outside funding they did get came from Saudi Arabia (outside of the CIA-ISI pipeline) and from other Arab donors.

cvsmpcn,0,t1_cvsm6mc,StudyingTerrorism,"That's a very weak argument. I am not fan of the Oath Keepers (I think they are far more harmful than helpful), but it is absurd to call them terrorists under the FBI definition, even if you included a provision on the threat of violence. First you would have to prove that the Oath Keepers were acting unlawfully and actively threatening violence, which in most instances of terrorism means making concrete threats (e.g. ""We will kill/destroy 'X' until you have done 'Y'), and then you have to state what their political or social objectives are.",1,0,1444321927,1444723255
cvslu0e,1,t3_3nz995,StudyingTerrorism,"Your right. Terrorism doesn't have a fixed definition. Not among academics, the different agencies in the United States, or different nations of the world. But that doesn't mean that terrorism cannot be defined, or even identified. You just need to better understand what terrorism is. 

As it was already stated, the definition you provide is so vague that a large degree of violent acts can fall into this category, which is why it not used by any authority. One of the most widely read papers on terrorism is Weinberg, Pedahzur, and Hirsch-Hoefler's article [""The Challenges of
Conceptualizing Terrorism""](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/095465590899768), which outlines this lack of a standard definition in the field. However, despite the lack of a common definition, there is still broad agreement on key elements that make up terrorism. Another major piece of academic literature on this topic is Alex Schmid and Albert Jongman's *Political Terrorism: A New Guide to Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data bases, Theories and Literature*, wherein the authors conducted a poll among the major terrorism scholars in an attempt to reach a more common definition. They took the 109 definitions that they received and compiled them into 22 definitional elements, listing them by frequency of use. I have included the top 13 in the list below: 

Definition | Frequency
:---------|----------: 
Violence, force | 83.5%
Political | 65%
Fear, terror | 51%
Threat | 47%
Psychological effects | 41.5%
Victim-target differentiation	 | 37.5%
Purposive, planned, systematic | 32%
Method of combat | 30.5%
Extranormality | 30%
Coercion | 	28%
Publicity | 21.5%
Random, impersonal | 21%
Civilians | 17.5%

As you can see, you already mentioned the primary two--violence and politics--but those are only part of most definitions. Many also include the targeting of civilians or noncombatants, the intended audience of these acts (which is not the same as those *directly* affected by the violence.) and the attempt to influence it, the organizational structure of those committing violence, the psychological effect of the violence and the generation of fear. From the above list, the authors provide the following definition: 

> Terrorism is an anxiety-inspiring method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual, group, or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal, or political reasons, whereby—in contrast to assassination—the direct targets of violence are not the main targets. The immediate human victims of violence are generally chosen randomly (targets of opportunity) or selectively (representative or symbolic targets) from a target population, and serve as message generators. Threat—and violence—based communication processes between terrorist (organization), (imperiled) victims, and main target (audiences(s)), turning it into a target of terror, a target of demands, or a target of attention, depending on whether intimidation, coercion, or propaganda is primarily sought.

Although it is very long, it gives a good overview of what terrorism generally is. Unfortunately, this definition doesn't help much outside of academic settings. To give you an idea of how terrorism is viewed in the world outside of academia, I am including some of the definitions used by various U.S. government agencies below:

**Federal Bureau of Investigation**

> The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.

**Department of State**

> Premeditated, politically-motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.

**Department of Defense**

> The calculated use of violence or threat of violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or try to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological.

As you can see, these definitions are much more thorough and includes elements of terrorism that you have left out of your definition, even if they are not as long as Schimd and Jongman's. To finish up, I am going to include my preferred definition of terrorism. It was was generated by Dr. Bruce Hoffman, one of the world's foremost authorities, if not *the* foremost authority, on terrorism and can be found in his book *Inside Terrorism*. He describes terrorism as:

* Ineluctably political in aims and motives;
* Violent--or, equally important, threatens violence;
* Designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target;
* Conducted *either* by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) or individuals or a small collection of individuals directly influenced, motivated, or inspired by the ideological aims or example of some existing terrorist movement and/or its leaders; and
* Perpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity. ",4,0,1444320662,1444723255
