Remember a crime is not a hate crime unless it is done with the intent of committing a crime based on a connection to a group.   

For example: If I beat up person who is gay because he cut me off in traffic is still a crime but not a hate crime.  Yet if I beat a person up who is gay just because he is gay, it is a hate crime.",-2,0,1444310050,1444717115
