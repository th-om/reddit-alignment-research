Yes, it is called a magazine. Please use the word. Clips are very rare these days. ",1,0,1444609928,1444718064

cvveg5f,0,t1_cvus8g0,GrinnnNBarrett,"Back in the early 90's Bill Clinton started making noise about an ""assault weapon"" ban. I started looking into that to see what it was all about. In the 70's and 80's one didn't see very many military look alike rifles. It was mostly bolt action rifles you would see at the range. Well, I ended up buying an AR-15 A2 HBAR Sporter in 1992 just ahead of Bill's ban. Still own it today.

Having realized what a fine and versatile rifle it was, I (along with the rest of America) have been fascinated with AR style rifles ever since.  

I give Bill Clinton credit for popularizing and marketing the AR platform we have today. 

Thanks Bill!",2,0,1444529378,1444718064
cvsqpjg,1,t3_3numox,GrinnnNBarrett,"I have *always* been of the school of thought that I would never kneel down just to be shot in the back of the head. It's not my character. I would rather die being shot while trying to choke the shit out of the futher mucker. I agree with his comment that if the gunman was rushed it might have saved 8 out of 10 lives. Nobody will *ever* teach that tactic in Active Shooter Awareness training. But in some situations, it would be the right thing to do. Remember the by-standers that put the end to the Gabrielle Gifford's shooting? Had by-standers not intervened Jared Lee Loughner would have kept right on shooting. ",0,0,1444327778,1444718064
