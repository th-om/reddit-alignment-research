Don't forget Oprah on the tea side. So understated, but it's becoming integral.

Bottled water too! 

If there's an emergency let's really fuck ourselves over by going after drinking water that is not easily or cheaply transported from other metro areas. 

Food and drinking water. What's the worst that could happen if we had a shortage?

Apple car in 3-5 years? 

How far fetched is Apple buying Tesla and spending a few billion on infrastructure versus going it alone?

Dell is buying EMC for $67b. How much would Tesla cost for Apple? ",2,0,1444697702,1444717344

>Looked at scooping up some EMC options on Friday based on the rumor (but didn't)  and was sad that it rose 5% after hours. Thought I missed the window but today the stock is flat and VMWare is off 10%.

>Any idea way Wall St isn't moving on this? 

Lots of debt and lots of players. 

Dell just recently went private and the company that acquired a large ownership stake is heavily involved here as well. It's basically PE and financialization of the industry. We will see how it plays out but in theory DellEMC will basically be Carlyle and Halliburton of tech platforms now. ",2,0,1444696841,1444717344

Eh, planned parenthood isn't the worst thing we spend our money on. It's least of all abortions, mostly pregnancy services and STD testing and counseling for people without insurance. 

It's a pain in the ass to get a routine STD test even if you have gold tier insurance. 2-4 weeks to get into a ptp/pcp, that leaves urgent care and usually reacting to symptoms. 

If nothing else PP is helping prevent the spread of stds regardless else you think about the organization.
