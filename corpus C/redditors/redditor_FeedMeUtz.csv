cvxbdzh,1,t3_3ogkll,FeedMeUtz,"Keep in mind that, until about 20 years ago, opposition to abortion was almost entirely a Roman Catholic issue.  Even in the Deep South, in the 1970s and 1980s there wasn't a massive push by evangelical Protestant churches to oppose abortion or birth control.  (That's not to say that they 'supported' abortion, it just wasn't a priority above all else.)  It was only fairly recently that it's been politically by the GOP used to whip up hysteria.

My trig teacher was Vietnamese, and she announced to the class that only the Asian students were capable of understanding the complexity of higher math, and we white and black students should just muddle along as best we could, she didn't expect us to pass.

cvttkgd,1,t3_3o0quo,FeedMeUtz,"There are lots of places in the USA, but here in Maryland there's Fort Detrick, where a lot of biodefense research work was done in the 1960s and 1970s.  I believe that some nearby flocks of sheep died from escaped nerve gas.  There's also a big piece of land in Gaithersburg that's NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), where physics research has been conducted for decades, and they even have a small functioning nuclear fission facility.

cvtsxvz,1,t3_3o1da8,FeedMeUtz,"I remember when this story was first published.  I went out on the Googles to do some research, and discovered that this company spends a massive amount of time and energy scrubbing the internet of any possibly negative comment about the company.  They also employ the tool of flooding the net with positive links.  I did find a mere handful of links where someone posted a complaint about the fact that their marketing methods are unsavory and it's very similar to a pyramid scheme, but then some of those links also contained vicious threats to the poster to remove the negative information.

If you are forced to resort to such drastic measures to protect your reputation, then there's probably something profoundly negative that you're trying to suppress.

cvtshf5,1,t3_3o1cyt,FeedMeUtz,"I notice in the comments of the newspaper that a commenter with an Arab screen name states that '80% of your women are raped by you before they're 18'.

It's important to realize that this is what many Saudi men believe.  They are told by their culture that Western women are whores, and thus don't deserve to be treated like anything else.  Whores by definition cannot be raped or molested, since by their very nature they have granted consent to every man.  (This is believed by some American men too, btw).

It's not just a question of some specific Saudi or arab men being 'ignorant' or 'uneducated'.  I saw myself that highly educated Saudi men, including princes, have cognitive dissonance about this issue.  In my 20s (in the 1970s) I was frequently going out to Georgetown discos and pubs, and there was a large contingent of Saudi men who were attending Georgetown University and American University who would party at these nightspots.  They would drink and try to pick up American girls, and I personally knew two women who were assaulted by Saudi men.  Years later I recognized the names of a couple of those princes as being very conservative leaders of the country.

Then there is the fact that their entire culture (in most Muslim countries) is completely saturated by the religion.  You may think that living in a rural US Southern Baptist community would be oppressive, but it's absolutely nothing compared to living in a fundamentalist Muslim place.

cvtroyq,0,t1_cvtbow2,FeedMeUtz,"I live in the DC area, and in Montgomery County, MD in the 1970s was the first time I heard of this.  There were a lot of diplomats living in the Potomac/Bethesda area, and some of their abused maids had escaped the homes and went to the county police with their evidence of abuse.  Back then, there were no advocates (still aren't many), no one understood what was happening culturally, and it was hard to find translators for the domestic helpers.  It was a big scandal for awhile, and the Saudi embassy was furious about the adverse publicity.  Now they are less likely to do this sort of thing unless they can control the surrounding area.  But even 40 years later, the police here aren't sure of what their powers are when it comes to diplomatic immunity (or when it's claimed, but they actually don't have it).
