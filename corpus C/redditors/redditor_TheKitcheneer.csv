cutekd2,0,t1_cutc8j1,TheKitcheneer,"Your probably pulled from nowhere number of $12,500 (which is far lower than the average full time Wal-Mart wage, as noted by /u/cantletthatstand) is actually almost $1,000 OVER the poverty line for a single person.

cuqpmdv,0,t1_cuqonqu,TheKitcheneer,I second trying GEICO.  My premiums dropped by more than 50% when I switched from USAA to GEICO.  I re-check the premiums every year and Progressive is always significantly higher as well.,2,0,1441391470,1444732052

cupvseq,0,t1_cupqok6,TheKitcheneer,"That ""problem"" could easily be solved with a life insurance policy on OP. I think it's making quite a leap to think that that's the only reason the had the abortion, especially considering that they had been trying for the baby, so it's not like she was surprised.

cumafdm,1,t3_3j39b1,TheKitcheneer,"The answer really depends on why you want a BIFL phone.  Because honestly, phones just aren't something that are good to buy for a long time.  The technology changes quickly, and even if you don't want to upgrade, lots of apps will just plain stop working on an old phone.

Instead of dropping 1000 euros on a phone, you should buy cheaper phones and replace them when they break.  Check out a phone like the Moto E or Moto G (new version is waterproof).  Get a good case for it.  When it breaks, replace it.  You can replace one of those 5-6 times before you hit 1000 euros, and you'll have a MUCH better experience than keeping one phone for 5-6 years.

But if you won't listen and really want THE MOST RUGGED PHONE EVER, check out the Samsung Galaxy Active lines.  Those are probably your best bet if you won't just go a cheap and replace strategy.",3,0,1441056501,1444732052

cubqx2w,0,t1_cubec18,TheKitcheneer,Agreed. I've had the same one for seven years now and it's still as good as the day I bought it. One of the best purchases I've ever made. ,3,0,1440248548,1444732052
