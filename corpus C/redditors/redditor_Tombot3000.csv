I'm not sure if they're actually using it to judge Western countries (statistics are far more available and reliable there anyway, so they wouldn't need to) but even if they are, it wouldn't skew the numbers as much as you'd expect. The vast majority of people do not live in the developed world. ",1,1,1444731466,1444731528

I do feel that a ban on Chinese nationals cooperating with NASA is against the tenets of science and is unnecessary politicking by congressmen sticking their hands into the scientific community. As far as it ""equally repugnant"" compared with a racial law I do disagree, but they're both quite terrible and I don't think it matters if we paint a night sky the same shade of black.

cvwlph0,0,t1_cvwl1ei,Tombot3000,"Correlating with nationality doesn't make it the same, nor does race being a protected class make it equivalent to nationality. In the USA and many other countries race is legally an explicitly separate class from nationality. You are wrong. 


Access to academic conferences isn't equivalent to access to unrestricted travel, which is often considered a human right. Banning Chinese is still unfair, I don't disagree with you on this, I simply object to your needless and wrongheaded assertion of racism. It is discriminatory and it is a bad idea, but it's not inherently racist.


You're not appealing to authority, you're only pretending to - find me an authority that says race=nationality and then you can say that's what you're doing. And deflecting by pointing out we are on /r/China and I'm a ""rando"" on the internet is meaningless; we both are.

You realize Manchurians, Tibetans, Uighur Chinese and the other 50+ ethnic groups in China are also banned under this, right? A white person with Chinese citizenship would be banned, while a Han chinese born in the USA would not. It's not their race, it's the antipathy between two governments and those governments involvement in academia that is the issue.
