cvscw92,0,t1_cvs31gt,sord_n_bored,"My friend has them somewhere on a computer, but basically we went with the Tactics Advance period because it had more races and interesting events going on. Tactics or Vagrant Story wouldn't work as well.

We changed the names of many standard classes to fit the world, and the rest we kept because it wasn't like any of them would be out of place in Ivalice (Fighter-Warrior, Thief-Rogue, Artificer-Engineer, etc).

Guns use the same rules as bows and arrows. I think we made a special gun-mage class.

You could retrain your current class to any other class by spending 24 hours and 100gp/level of your main class, but only towards a secondary multiclass (so if you put 5 levels into rogue and 1 into warrior, for 500gp you could switch to a level 5 rogue level 1 warrior). Nobody really switched because it was cumbersome, and the classes are pretty fun anyway. Feats and multi-class feats also had a cost I think. Levelling up happened practically once every two or three games.

For races, Bangaa were Dragonborn with a bonus to Con instead of Cha, and no fire breath (it was something borrowed from the half-orc racial tree I think). Seeq also borrowed from half-orcs, but had bonuses to stealth and thievery. Moogles were half-lings with a minor levitate ability. Viera = Wood Elves. Gria = Windsoul Genasi. Revgaji = Half-elf with dwarven resistance instead of dual heritage. Etc.

Then items were changed to fit the theme. Phoenix Downs were a special, expensive item that allowed for auto-stabilize and Con+Lvl HP in battle. Most monsters work the same, just had a different name and look. There was a lot of third party support for making new monsters and stuff if you had a DCI account.",2,0,1444303606,1444729549

cvrj61x,0,t1_cvrd69z,sord_n_bored,"Haha, ironically, I'm playing Oblivion now for the fourth time, and it's my least favorite Elder Scrolls game (and I'm counting Battlespire and Elder Scrolls: Adventures)...

... Ok, well it's under Adventures but above the first two TES games and TESO. I really hate it, but I still enjoy parts of it. If it wasn't for OMM I'd write it off as a dumpster fire and purge it from my memory, but the quests are too goddamn fun.

And I know humans have some aspects to them that are interesting, that's why I mentioned Red Guards, since they also get a lot of cool stuff. Nords were also cooler in my mind before Skyrim (where they kinda fell flat to me.) And speaking of snake-people, there's that whole Akaviri thing going on to the east which is rife with mysterious intrigue we'll probably never see.

And to be fair to LotR, that world could have an interesting game too, you just need to do it right. I think Cyrodiil was all the Shire and none of the rest of Middle Earth. Half of the maps were randomly generated and left that way, at least. Compared to Skyrim and Morrowind, which were more carefully crafted. There are so many beautiful hills in Skyrim, that just take your breath away when you crank up the draw distance. Or the strange houses of the Telvanni. I struggle to think of anything really unique in Oblivion except maybe the Shivering Isles?

Anyway, on-topic...

For me, I think it's mostly about how Skyrim sort of stays out of my way as a system. And I know a few of my friends really hated on Oblivion for some of its quests, namely the Dark Brotherhood stuff. One friend really fell in love with the group, and hated how he couldn't do anything but kill them all or just end the story early, whereas the Dark Brotherhood has crap happen in Skyrim, but there are slightly more ways to deal with it, and it gave you space to react however you'd like. It's hard to contextualize, but I think reactivity counts, and also maybe the way in which the game doesn't react, but leaves you space to imagine. Like comparing Fallout: New Vegas to a Bioware game. In Bioware games everything you do is on a pre-made track, so the game can react to the few choices you're given, but in New Vegas a lot of decisions and paths are neutral, and things just sort of naturally progress from your choices, but you rarely get an NPC to directly remark about what you've done.

If the Dark Brotherhood quest was written closer to how Obsidian writes, where it's very loose, then if the player chooses not to kill the Dark Brotherhood and instead kills the messenger that would be the end of that. If it was Bioware you'd have no choice but to do that. Since Oblivion has a lot of support in and around their quests, it feels like not killing the Dark Brotherhood isn't a choice, even though you can technically do that. Because the story continues further on after you kill them.

I think all of these games could do more to go through simple, character defining methods of roleplay. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines is my favorite RPG because it's full of very small character-defining decisions. And the repetition of going back and forth to your lair, climbing the vampire social ladder and dealing with mortals and immortals gets you into the feel of the world. Every interaction is small, and most ""quests"" are resolved quickly, but because of that the decisions they offer you can be wider as well, and the way the vampire world treats you leaves space for giving your character individual reasons for why they did X, Y or Z, while retaining that interactivity.

Which is a lot of words that probably doesn't make sense.",2,0,1444241405,1444729549
