cvxu5ia,1,t3_3ojh3j,kevinbaconjames,"I'm a rank amatuer, so take any advice I give with a large helping of salt, but heres a bunch of random observations that stuc out to me for the TBBT script:

- The origins of surnames is a good topic of conversation for the guys to have, it fits the show perfectly

- You do a very good job of finding the characters voices, I can very easily picture them delivering this dialogue

- I think the cold open ran too long. The whole Washington exchange was awkward, it forced Koothrapali to circle back a second time, which was repetitive, and the payoff was not as strong as with Hancock. After Sheldon gave the long speech about the meaning of Hancock, there should have been one last wisecrack from Leonard or Walowitz, then the credits.

- ""He was a famous general and our first president after all"". This dialogue feel awkward, maybe a little too wordy?

- The jokes about slavery, and rich white guys loving Washington doesn't seem to fit the tone of the show IMO, its a little too deep

- Sheldon butts in straight away before anyone else can answer the question about fictional characters. While this is classic Sheldon, the scene might feel more natural and less obvious narrative setup if you allowed Walowitz and Koothrapali to give a couple of answers first.

- Leonard is a fan of the Wu Tang Clan? That seems out of character for him

- Sheldon saying ""rapper"" struck me as odd, I would expect him to say something more robotic, like ""musical artist""

- ""I've already taken it many times"". Yes, I'm being pedantic, but 'Many' is not natural dialogue. 'A bunch of times', 'heaps of times' or 'several times' all sound better

- Leonards joke about being forced to take the IQ test by his mother is funny, very true to the character

- Bernadette and Penny both say 'attractive' right after each other, its repetitive. Change one of them to 'sexy' or 'hot'

- Bernadette is spelt wrong throughout 

- ""tried and tried and tried and tried"" was funny, great line. I like that Bernadette adds to it. 

- ""Your nose could probably track down a pizza delivery truck across town"". The setup is good, but I think you can get a punchier punchline. ""Your nose could track down a...""

- Sheldon being proud that Leonard ""Let"" him order seems strange. Sheldon doesn't need Leonards permission to do anything, quite the opposite in fact.

- This is a small thing, but I think Sheldons IQ score should be higher. He is established to be quite a bit smarter than Leonard and Koothrapali, and it would be more effective if he was a 180, only 1 point behind Walowitz

- The name mix up conclusion was predictable. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, but I could see it coming right from the start. 


Overall I really enjoyed reading this script, the character's dialogue felt very natural, and the story fit the show well. A script like this can always be punched up with a few more jokes, which wouldn't hurt. 

Again, I would like to point out that I'm a total newbie myself and probably don't really know what I'm talking about, but let me know what you think.
