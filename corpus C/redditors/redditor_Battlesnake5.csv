cvdn70s,0,t1_cvdlipi,Battlesnake5,It's only strange to you because you think you've caught your opponents in a contradiction. But I don't know why you would think that. Nobody has to support a welfare agenda to oppose what they see as murder.,8,0,1443182262,1444724142
cvdn4k5,0,t1_cvdlrj6,Battlesnake5,"Is that why half of America is ""pro-life"" and the other side won't directly defend abortion? Pro-choice people won't even say what you wrote in public. All you ever hear from that side is diversionary tactics about wars on women and inconsistent autonomy arguments.

>That I feel would be the best way to alleviate the problems we are facing.

Yeah, that's been the experiment for the past hundred years. We haven't actually gotten to a point where any of the base problems are solved. We've had a democrat who's supposed to ""regulate Wall Street"" every fucking decade. ",1,0,1442891996,1444724142

cv9rp1p,0,t1_cv9dxhm,Battlesnake5,"We absolutely have classes. We have one class which owns capital and purchases labor as a commodity. There is another which does not own much more than the ability to woke, so they sell that labor. And then there are third classes, like skilled professionals who own a set of credentials, or people who own capital but not enough to separate themselves from the workers, like someone who owns a barbershop or something. 

Eliminating that artificial hierarchy, the power disparity between buyer and seller of labor, is what is meant by elimination of class. Not making sure that someone doesn't have a nicer car than yours. That would be silly.",1,0,1442888874,1444724142

""The BRAIN Initiative"" sounds like a douchey social media startup, and all the backronyms are the same. The DREAM Act. The way all the subsections in the ACA are denoted ""XYZ for All American Families."" Everything shouldn't read like a PR move. ",-1,0,1442878301,1444724142
