If the first shop killed the digitizer on your current phone (likely if they were attempting a glass replacement), but gave you a refund, you aren't out any money.  With the curved glass on the iPhone 6's, you needed a new digitizer anyway.  Any place claiming to fix just the glass screen 'good as new' is probably full of shit.  Even in the best cases, they're never as responsive after you swap just the glass.

If they bricked your phone, you may have some damages.",2,0,1444430128,1444720802

Dead spots on the screen are common after you just replace the glass.  Off-brand OEM digitizers are typically all or nothing.  It usually either works or it doesn't.

cvtgxvs,1,t3_3nxxb0,monsterbate,"I'm guessing this is some sort of food job or retail?  Distance to the job is a totally reasonable criteria for selecting candidates, because commute time does tend to affect attendance.  I don't know about Canada, but in the US it's a perfectly fine criteria to use when selecting candidates, and goes hand in hand with them verifying reliable transportation.

And on the other accusation of potential discrimination, I'm going to tell you something that you'll never get the business to admit.  Assuming the business is retail, or otherwise includes employees dealing with customers face-to-face, they want their employees to reflect the demographics of the location they are serving.

If it's a wealthy, white area, they want their staff to be mostly clean cut white kids.  That's just the nature of the beast.  Wealthy white folks tend to get skittish when the employees of a retail place get too ""ethnic"".  It's terrible, and the people in charge may have no desire to discriminate, but the effects are the same.  It's just likely born of pragmatism and a desire for continued good business rather than overt racism.

**tl;dr -** Distance to the job is a valid selection criteria for candidates, and you won't prove discrimination unless they say ""we only hire white kids"", or otherwise give you some concrete evidence to that effect, even if that is their intent.",1,0,1444374349,1444720802
cvtgi03,0,t1_cvtfzzw,monsterbate,"The flip side of that is that as imaging technology and genetic understanding has increased, several mental disorders have correlated to testable physical manifestations.  The field of biological psychiatry, of which Thomas Insel is an influential authority (the guy anticapitalist keeps quoting), seeks to explain mental disorders with physical/genetic abnormalities or injury.  

They've actually proven over the years that a few of Sasz's theories were correct, though not how he thought.  People with mental disorders aren't 'malingerers' as Szazs assumed.  Instead, several of the mental illnesses his contemporary psychiatrists were attempting to describe through symptoms have been discovered to be *literal* brain diseases with physical manifestations.  Most of the modern psychiatry practiced falls under the 'biological psychiatry' umbrella.  It's why there's been a shift towards medication and away from ""talking cures"".  

There are plenty of valid criticisms for the modern field of psychiatry, but that's not really what anticapitalist is doing in denying the existence of mental illness.  He's more akin to a climate change denier, flat-earther, or creationist than someone lodging a legitimate complaint towards the mental health industry.",1,0,1444372838,1444720802

According to Szazs, most people complaining of behavioral symptoms were 'malingerers' and if your couldn't find evidence of an illness with an autopsy, it wasn't real.  

He actually did manage to push psychology out of the dark ages in a few areas, and laid the groundwork for some of the means tests and methods used by modern biological psychiatrists.  

Unfortunately, he was also a bit of a crackpot who was convinced that most psychiatric patients were faking their symptoms and either doing it for attention, for drug seeking, to avoid responsibility, or as a form of hypochondria.

*I believe that some behaviors/feelings correlate to biological pathologies, and that these correlations are useful in the diagnoses of underlying disorders.*

You seem to be arguing with someone else.  You're attributing context and assertions to my argument that I am not making, then responding to them as if I did.  

Once again, you are citing Thomas Insel as an authority to support your belief that mental illness isn't 'real'.  He is a biological psychologist that believes in mental illness.  Your entire assertions seems to be that illness cannot exist without a physical lesion and refuse to acknowledge that diagnoses are made all of the time in medical science based on the *syndrome*, absent other physical indicators.

I am making no judgment on the ""morality"" of the symptoms of mental illness, merely pointing out that your refusal to accept their existence is absurd, specifically when you are using the words of respected psychiatrists (taken out of context) in an attempt to support your claim.",2,0,1444346141,1444720802
cvt0a56,0,t1_cvszpvl,monsterbate,">  In other words, you believe it's true because you believe it's true.

No.  I believe it's true based on the evidence presented.  There is more to the field of psychiatry than self reported subjective feelings.  Just like when a doctor says ""show me where it hurts"", a biological psychiatrist uses patient reported symptoms and observations to narrow down the diagnoses in conjunction with the morphology of the patient's brain, and data gleaned from actual medical tests and other physical indicators that correlate to the disease.  

The conscious mind arises from the interconnected workings of the physical nervous system, and problems with the latter give rise to a various syndromes that manifest in the former in predictable ways.  Biological psychiatry is real science, with repeatable experiments and controls.

> By the way, of course psychiatrists claim to be ""biological psychiatrists."" The debate is whether there's any validity to it, and there isn't.

You can't present the words of a couple of biological psychiatrists as authoritative on a subject, while also denying their credibility in the field they are commenting on.  You either have to acknowledge the validity of their field, or dispense with relying on them as sources, if you want any amount of credibility for your argument.

cvszcss,0,t1_cvsxybr,monsterbate,"The concept of 'disease' is not based purely on physical defect.  Many diseases are defined only by the syndrome (symptoms) in medical science.  Besides, several of the doctors and studies you keep linking come from are practitioners of biological psychiatry.

From Shorter's refutation of Szasz's work (the godfather of the pseudoscience you keep pushing):
>it is the contention of biological psychiatry that so-called mental illnesses are actually brain diseases. Modern psychiatry has de facto dispensed with the idea of mental illness, i.e. the notion that psychiatric disease is mainly or entirely psychogenic is not a part of biological psychiatry.

Both Insel and Frances are biological psychiatrists.  They both contend that mental disorders arise as the syndromes (cluster of related symptoms) associated with physical brain diseases.  Neither dispute the existence of mental disorder.  They only dispute the *semantics* associated with labeling the syndrome as the illness, rather than the underlying morphology that causes them. 

**TL;DR** - The people you keep quoting don't believe that mental illness is fake.  They dispute the accuracy of labeling the symptoms as the illness, rather than the underlying organic causes that give rise to the symptoms.  ",5,0,1444340376,1444720802
