To dissuade consumers from buying equivalent but cheaper overseas editions at import shops or on-line, they make the domestic editions limited/deluxe by adding bonus tracks or other special stuff.

It's not really divided into two systems. 

*All* countries allow citizenship to be passed by parentage in some form. Some countries also grant citizenship by location of birth.

A kid in the class typed out a 2 or 3 line BASIC program that drew a wavy line across the screen using graphic characters (horizontal bars of varying position). I was totally blown away - you could make a computer draw stuff!

That kid is now a manager of engineering at a major electronics/computer hardware company.

cvpwnt4,0,t1_cvpkapb,lobster_conspiracy,"Yoda is saying that “just trying” - an attitude of doing something with no expectation or resolve to succeed, we’ll see what happens - is not enough. You either resolutely do it with full intent to succeed, or decide not to do it with the acceptance that you will fail. (Either choice is acceptable.) But if you do and fail, don’t shrug it off with “Oh well, I tried.” Get raging mad that you failed, and do again.

This could be solved by making birthright citizenship ‘opt-out’ for parents who can prove that their child is entitled to another citizenship (namely their own, through parentage) at birth. Current U.S. and Canadian law does not allow parents to opt out at birth, and parents cannot renounce a child’s citizenship under any circumstances ; birthright citizenship is *imposed*, not *granted*. (Historically, *jus solis* in English law, even before the U.S. was founded, was aimed at forcing people to be subjects of the king.)

I find this a bit disturbing and think this is just as unfair for a person to be “bound” with obligations to a country to which he has almost no ties, as it is to be “entitled” to rights from it (which is the usual argument against anchor babies).
