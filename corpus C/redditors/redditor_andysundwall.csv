cvd23yo,1,t3_3m78h6,andysundwall,"I would have to say that Arrieta does due to the division that he plays in. The Cubs have a better record than the Dodgers and are in 3rd place in the Central division although the Dodgers are first place in the West with a worse record. If the Dodgers were to face against the Central competition, they wouldn't be in first which by ESPN's Cy Young Predictor, they give 12 ""Value Points"" to Greinke for leading his team to first place in their division which is unfair. Also, Arrieta has a +3 lead (4 to 1) over Greinke in CG, as well as having 3 shutouts while Greinke has had none so far. Arrieta has lower sabermetrics stats than Greinke in all three of the major ones for pitchers (FIP, xFIP, and SIERA).",-13,0,1443131034,1444727922
cv6h6qn,0,t1_cv66a1w,andysundwall,"I wouldn't say that his hand up is every time in between pitches. /u/syowsers is correct in asking about this, cause he does not hold his hand out for time in between every pitch. It may be that I somehow randomly chose the one video where it didn't happen but when I went on YouTube and typed in ""Kyle Seager"" to see how he batted, this was the first one I saw that was labeled ""Kyle Seager batting stance"", and it showed [this](https://youtu.be/2Jc9k1lgtq8) as his batting stance. In the video, he steps up to the plate five times in four pitches. One time he called time with his hand, and one time he stepped out of the box for time. The remaining three pitches were a normal step up with a lean and bat across his chest before straightening his back. To say that he holds his hand up between each pitch is a stretch.",1,0,1442622686,1444727922
cv5zmuc,0,t1_cv5y6i8,andysundwall,"While I agree that both sides can be seen, but if you're a batter who is trying to take away a pitcher's rhythm you can just as easily step out of the box or readjust your gloves and take their time. Once you are in the box, doing your pre-swing motions and then grabbing your crotch and adjusting your jersey should not be a tactic used. 

Weaver may be one of their strongest pitchers, but he definitely did not make that about him. If one batter does something like that, who is to say that any other batter may not try that down the road against another team. 

Batters are already given an advantage comparatively to pitchers. If a pitcher throws in on a guy trying to back him off the plate or if he loses grip mid throw and it goes a bit up and in, the pitcher is the one given a warning no questions asked. 

A good example of such favoritism might be when Brett Lawrie took out Alcides Escobar with no ejections then the favor is returned and Ventura is immediately thrown out. In both incidents, either play could have cut someone's career short yet the one by a pitcher gets an ejection.",6,0,1442593162,1444727922

I don't know why the nickname Larry was stated by OP, rather than saying his birth name which he is known by more. He is a known proponent of Net Neutrality, and was featured in a film called *Killswitch* with Aaron Swartz and Edward Snowden. He also advocates for free and open source software. *Republic, Lost* is a good book to read, if you haven't heard of it or have and haven't read it yet.",3,0,1442438346,1444727922
