This dude was all pissed of, saying I owed him an answer from a report we received from a supplier, and he copied his boss

I attached an email to my response, which was him giving me the information he claimed I was withholding from him

It was delicious ",2,0,1444252833,1444731594

cuufo6f,1,t3_3k3dc5,me_at_work,"I think the abortion question has been answered well - executive can choose not to enforce more easily than fabricating a new rule to enforce.

The guns portion is a better question.  There are certainly people who would argue that the lack of enforcement of marijuana laws is endangering the public, but I think that argument is more easily made for regulating gun sales - so to answer your question of ""what if.."", I think the response would be a public outcry denouncing that presidents strategies, possibly enough to cause that president to change course.  I'm sure there has been some advocacy against obamas marijuana strategy but not enough that i've heard about it and certainly not enough to influence his decision ",14,0,1441722788,1444731594
