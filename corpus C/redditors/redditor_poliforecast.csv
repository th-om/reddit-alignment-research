cvtywdn,0,t1_cvtwajo,poliforecast,"Really?  So the fact that we're raping and polluting the oceans to the point that they'll eventually be incapable of sustaining Killer Whales is news to you?  And you think passing stricter regulation on the fishing industry--whose fishing industry!?!--is going to fix the problem?  You're operating under a profound level of ignorance yet call yourself an animal rights attorney?

Ugh.  So you appreciate this.  Eventually, the oceans will be so barren and polluted killer whales will go extinct in the wild.  This is going to happen.  There's nothing you can do about it.",-6,0,1444415132,1444730386
cvtx2nw,1,t3_3o3dyo,poliforecast,This reminds me of what I tell my wife when she complains about my snoring.  Basically that she sleeps better when I'm snoring since my snoring evolved to scare predators (like bears and saber-tooth lions) away from our cave while we were sleeping.  She doesn't believe me.,2,0,1444412413,1444730386
cvt3d0a,0,t1_cvt0k57,poliforecast,"See, you went too far.  You mind-read you.  I wasn't excusing anyone, least of all you.  The point stands.  Your upset requires you take what Obama said out of the context in which he said it.  Why must you pervert what he said to excuse lashing out?  It's not necessary.  Be angry.  It's okay.",1,0,1444347039,1444730386
cvss7ju,1,t3_3nvilj,poliforecast,"I think he is speaking in relative (to other nations, thinking Russia and Saudi Arabia are current examples) terms.  He has a point too.  What percentage of the shit you hold America at fault for is stuff you wouldn't even know about if it weren't for America (Americans) telling you about it in the first place?  Now ask yourself what percentage of shit you hold other countries at fault for you know about exclusively because those countries (or their citizens) made it known.

That last one might only seem like a hard question to answer because you are hyper focused on America, which is also a relevant point worth acknowledging.  You only care about the US because we matter.  The US only matters because we care (maybe not as much as you'd like, but a hell of a lot more than the Russians, Chinese, Israelis, Saudis, etc.).",1,0,1444329922,1444730386
