Owning a gun has been linked to higher risks of (1) homicide, (2) suicide, and (3) accidental death by gun.

• For every time a gun is used in self-defense in the home, there are (4) 7 assaults or murders, 11 suicide attempts, and 4 accidents involving guns in or around a home.

• (5) 43% of homes with guns and kids have at least one unlocked firearm.

• In one experiment, (6) one third of 8-to-12-year-old boys who found a handgun pulled the trigger.

So, the final huge asterisk needs to be considered in the context of the original comment:
> Guns are more risk than reward when it comes to protection from harm (for the majority of Americans).

Seeing as reward is a potentially subjective thing, it might be said that you could *never* make this statement because you don't know the bounds of satisfaction of a person using a gun.

If owning and shooting a gun produced a full on physical and mental state of euphoria and enlightenment previously unknown to mankind... then the ""reward"" might outweigh any personal risks, or even risks to other people, depending on the morals of the person involved.

But if we are allowed to view this in a more everyday context, if the risk of death outweighs the reward of a hobby or potential defense tool, then I would say that yes there is more risk than reward. There are other similarly cited examples on the Mother Jones case that could contribute to this argument.

I'm open to argument or interpretation of the cited information, but these positions have been put forward in most of these conversations. I'm a little surprised the original commenter bailed.",1,0,1443835255,1444727886
