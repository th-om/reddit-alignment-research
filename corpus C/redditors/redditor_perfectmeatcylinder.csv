cvxbs1v,1,t3_3ohkhm,perfectmeatcylinder,"He has said before he will not comment on his progress until he is done.

However, other people ""in the know"" (e.g., translators and publishers) have indicated we will get it soon perhaps by season 6. Just because he doesn't write about it on his blog, doesn't mean he doesn't give updates to his publisher (who would then provide information to other publishers on an as-needed basis, and those guys leak). Likewise he may have shared early drafts with D&D to help make the show better, so people on the show (even those who have not read the drafts themselves) may know how much has been written. A few months ago nikolaj coster-waldau said that the next book was basically done.

cvx4hwn,0,t1_cvx1h2m,perfectmeatcylinder,"The bags are not sealed with nitrogen unless they made a change very recently. Nor do they include an oxygen absorbed packet in the bag. And they're sure as heck not vacuum-packed (that would make them like coffee bricks). They say they reduce the oxygen when packing the bags (??) which is really weird if they aren't including an oxygen absorber.

cvx2fbk,0,t1_cvx2115,perfectmeatcylinder,"no offense intended to bfish, but not all his posts are that great. see especially his posts extrapolating a publication date for TWOW treating GRRM's writing progress as strictly linear. GRRM writes fast sometimes, writes slow sometimes, doesn't write at all (on the ASOIAF books) many times. one of those posts was maybe worth a giggle, but he's continued to update them and people hang on his words like he's a prophet.",-1,0,1444668471,1444730344
