Well good thing I've got all my bases covered then because I've got the elegance of a princess in a sundress.

The fact that you perceived my posts to be an attempt at some over the top astonishing display of rhetorical prowess, really says more about you than me. This is just par for the goddamn course, baby.

cvwl5c2,0,t1_cvwiwj4,ThisisClambake,"I don't think that many people, outside of those who never would have supported Obama under any circumstances, would call his presidency a massive disappointment. I think he let a lot of people down, and it would cost him votes, but in general the populace isn't counting down the days until they finally rid themselves of him. Well, they are counting down the days because of election hype, but that's a different issue.

I don't necessarily think you are wrong in your criticisms of Obama, but you're pointing out just a couple specific reasons that some vague, unknown percentage of the population would be inclined to vote against him. I don't personally estimate that percentage as being large enough to beat him. Nobody is saying he'd win a third term in a landslide. 

You are right to point out that the Republicans still have time to build their perfect candidate. I would point out that on the other side, in the alternate reality where Obama ran for a third term, he would also be going to great lengths to present himself as the model incumbent and finding creative ways to give his supporters the motivation that they lack.



>If that were true, he wouldn't have negative approval ratings. He does. 


I'll reiterate that his approval rating aren't dismal. He's above 40, which is relatively safe territory, if not ideal. He's also not at an all time low, nor has he suffered a recent sharp drop. People aren't passionately opposed to Obama, they are mildly disgruntled. 

Regardless, the ""general likability"" I referred to in my first post was not in reference to his job approval, but rather the fact that people feel like they know the guy, are generally comfortable with his motives - if not his actions - and have mostly positive feelings about him, personally.

One phenomenon we haven't seen tested in the US, due to the 2 term limit, is that a political leader needs to commit increasingly more and more unpopular deeds, the longer they are in power, to turn the public against them. Winning a 1st term requires significant enthusiasm for your candidacy. Winning a 2nd term often simply requires an average or adequate presidential performance. I believe that this trend of diminishing requirements would continue. Winning a 3rd term, I hypothesize, would be common among most presidents who hadn't found some way to completely turn off a very large segment of the population. So I think that Obama would win a 3rd term, but I actually don't think that he's especially unique in that way among other presidents who have been elected and reelected. The obvious counterargument would be George W, who I think most would agree could not have won a 3rd term. This, to me, seems more likely to be the anomaly.

Sorry about the wordiness of this post, I could have made my points more succinctly, but I like to type.",5,0,1444621956,1444717528
