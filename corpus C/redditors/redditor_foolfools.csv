cvqhe4w,0,t1_cvqgloq,foolfools,"> How do you determine worth of labor?

Common sense. Income divided up decreed by time and effort expended. 


>If I ""consent"" to work for a wage

It's not possible to ""consent"" in a relationship with such a power imbalance. Capitalist: You work for the wage I tell you under the conditions I decree. Worker: consent or starve. 


>if my labor is worth more than yours, is it ok for me to earn more than you?

How do *you* define worth? Some fat cat is more comfortable with you? Supply and demand of available labor has no relation to what your labor is worth, just what you are paid.",1,0,1444162435,1444721782

That's not the only way. In fact, the original sentiment was *religion* as the way for good people to do bad things.

[With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil â€” that takes religion.](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg)",-2,0,1439941843,1444721782
