cvxqylu,0,t1_cvxpxp8,4mg1n3,"Sin is not inherited, it is learned. To sin is to miss the purpose of something. The only true sin, is to live life without purpose.

Original Sin makes sense in such a way that it describes how people should not act. It does not mean that every person thereafter is damned because of how someone before them behaved, but rather that they should learn from the lessons of their ancestors.

The story of Adam and Eve only makes sense in the context of a lesson. For someone to damn themselves, and to claim that they are sinful (or that they inherited the sin of their ancestors) - having never truly sinned - is the exact opposite of what religious text intends. One is not liable for the sins of past men, but only for his own.",1,1,1444705614,1444722733
cvxkxvs,1,t3_3my1ug,4mg1n3,"It doesn't really seem like a matter of right or wrong. The truth is, people can behave morally or immorally under any economic or governmental structure. 

I personally think that capitalism - REAL capitalism - is the best way to go, because it best reflects man's most basic desire: to behave freely.

Some touchstone examples: If people are upset with the quality of manufacturer A, then they can go to manufacturer B. If people discover that industry Y hurts the environment, then they can go to industry X.

Capitalism provides the latitude of choice that people like to have. It allows for people to express their business ideas, and to be rewarded according to the level of their accomplishments. There is not a more accurate depiction of human creativity, than the free marketplace of ideas and innovations -- and there is no greater motivator, than competition.",1,1,1444696257,1444722733
cvxk39r,1,t3_3ogss7,4mg1n3,"If there were not a connection between the government and industry, then we would not need to worry about regulation and business standards. Businesses would be free to do as they please.

Under this logic, it would be assumed that businesses would take moral imperative upon themselves, otherwise they would not make enough sales because of a poor public image.

What we can do, as consumers - a body of cognizant individuals - is suspend our patronage of immoral companies; and direct our money to companies that behave in ways that we agree with. This would shift the level of market control to more moral players, as well as incentivize companies like Volkswagen to get their shit together. Overall, this would increase the rate of innovation, as companies would compete to be more moral, as opposed to the current condition which is this: who can manipulate the rules the most efficiently?",1,1,1444694911,1444722733
cvxjme7,1,t3_3ofxu9,4mg1n3,"That quote does not prove that ""most people go to hell.""

First, what was meant by that passage is that there are many ways to act destructively. There are many ways to commit evil. This does not necessarily imply that most people go to hell, however.

Secondly, let's suppose that hell is real. Let's further suppose that only 0.1% of people end up in hell. It is still not irresponsible to procreate. People are responsible for their own actions, not the actions of their children or their parents. In other words, if someone chooses to act destructively - if they decide to be a member of the 0.1% of society - then it was their choice. It would be on their own shoulders, then, that they bear the burden of eternal suffering. 

You cannot blame parents for a child that becomes evil, unless they teach that child to be evil themselves. If the child chooses to be evil despite having good parents, then the parents are not at fault. So, for the love of God, have a child if you want to. Just make sure to be a responsible parent and teach them right versus wrong!",1,1,1444694124,1444722733
cvxizi2,0,t1_cvxik9k,4mg1n3,"So you're saying that a contingency is not the same thing as a causal relationship? If this is the case, I agree. Perhaps I did not describe my understanding of contingency well enough on my part..

cvxigva,1,t3_3n40ym,4mg1n3,"""I found evidence of God because I followed a twelve-step program, thought really hard about God, then believed God exists.""

Revelation sustains no truth value exterior to the one who had the revelation. So even though God may exist to you by means of revelation, your revelation does not persist beyond your own mind. 

Therefore, yes, God exists, but only to you. Unless you can touch my forehead and mystically impose the same revelation, then it is not truly God that has been revealed to you. God's existence would be unconditional, no? There is no way that God only becomes revealed to those who can type in the cheat-codes.",1,0,1444692249,1444722733
cvxi48p,1,t3_3oi2p2,4mg1n3,"First and foremost, I would like to say that I appreciate your thought of a ""chain of contingencies"", and the imagery you describe of water and tree becoming apple. That was nice.

However, you must check your premises. In order for a chain of contingencies to begin, it's beginning must be contingent upon something. The singularity theory is an assumption, and therefore cannot provide truth value to the beginning of the contingency sequence, unless it is proven to be true.

The fundamental notion here is cause/effect. Effect is contingent upon cause; and cause necessitates effect. Necessity is a condition of contingency, much like how water is a condition of apple becoming tree. Because the tree had water, which was necessary; it verily produced the apple, the contingent effect.

Lastly, a note about ""nothing."" There is no way to capture the essence of ""nothing"" because it does not have essence. Nothing begets nothing, as it were. And of time... time is relative.

EDIT: Don't think about this shit too much, you'll drive yourself crazy! ;)",4,0,1444691676,1444722733
cvxhfyq,1,t3_3oiap0,4mg1n3,"I'm certainly not ""pissed off"" by any of this. However, I think that there might be some contradictions in what he says.

For example, he addresses Jehova directly and essentially says, ""You do not exist, because I do not want to believe in you."" I find this interesting, it's as if he is building his universe around his beliefs as opposed to building his beliefs around the universe.

He does successfully identify that this is an irrational conclusion, but it also departs from logic in a structural way: 

For someone to say, ""You do not exist,"" is to address ""You"" - in this case Jehova - and claim its non-existence. If it truly, TRULY did not exist, then it would not be necessary to claim its non-existence, because there would be no object to describe anyways. This is one of the greatest contradictions of atheism, to claim absolute truth because of a lack of evidence or refusal to believe. Even entertaining the notion of God, or Jehova, or whatever; for the sparest moment; is to admit that it exists in some way. 

The only rational, non-contradictory argument for atheism would then be an argument of ""no evidence"", which does not logically impose non-existence.

I agree that the scientific method is not perfect, but it is the best thing we have. Irrational beliefs are not bad, especially if they bring someone happiness -- if you want to believe in God's benevolence, for perhaps comfort reasons, or for guidance, then more power to you.",3,0,1444690573,1444722733
