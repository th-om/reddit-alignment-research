I think there was a modern marvels on this story, and in the end it even had the explination that it was impossible to be true.  I personally can't make up my mind on the whole thing.

cvp2qeg,0,t1_cvp0euc,geeeeeedub,"Well said.  

""I don't expect new anti-gun legislation to significantly reduce the number of violent crimes in the US.""

Me neither:  This would require some real soul searching on the causes of violence, and working on a solution to these problems.  Inner city violence resulting from gangs, violence on the boarder resulting from the drug war, ""affluenza"" inflicted white kids shooting up their schools all require wildly different approaches to tackle because they stem from wildly different problems.  

It's just too easy to get onto TV to stoke emotions by spouting soundbites about ""the gun show loophole"", ""common sense reform"", ""high capacity magazines"", ""shoulder things that go up"", ""armor piercing ammunition"", and even worse, it's too easy to pass these laws which won't change anything.  

A real discussion on the causes of violence quickly goes into taboo territory of legalizing drugs/prostitution.  It also runs head on into the fact that criminals are not criminals until they commit a crime, and the mentally ill are not mentally ill until they do something crazy.  That's where the real reform lies, and no one wants to engage in such monumental reforms, it's just unsexy and not TV friendly.  

Here is some more unsexy solutions that get ignored:  fully fund our existing programs!  Background checks should be fast and accurate, and COMPLETED.  Right now if a background check isn't completed in time, it defaults in a PASS.  This is a scandal in itself, we have laws on the books that aren't even being enforced.  Allow private sellers to run background checks if they want to.  ",24,0,1444064616,1444726364
cvlbpuy,0,t1_cvl93ak,geeeeeedub,"I agree with you completely.  This is what's called compromise.  The gun control crowd should calmly and politely *jump* at the opportunity for more regulations being suggested by pro gun crowd.  They can fight other battles another day.  Just give me the option to run a background check when I sell to a stranger.  When a background check takes too long and someone passed because there wasn't funding to get it done in time, this is a failure.  Y'all can try and repeal the second amendment another day, these are home run ideas, and could be embraced right away.  Obama's right, you can't pray the problem away, so why not do something pragmatic.",11,0,1443756101,1444726364

cvl66fv,0,t1_cvl5tfx,geeeeeedub,"Yes I have some heavy lifting ideas... But what else can we do?  Repeal the 2nd amendment?  Allow searches of people's papers and effects?  Allow the sharing of medical records?  There is a reason for the deadlock on this issue, it's a very difficult one to tackle.  Eliminating black markets is actually more reasonable than repealing amendments.  These are monumental tasks.",5,0,1443746544,1444726364
