cvxcsz0,1,t3_3ohzj8,AgentElman,"Submission Statement: If you scroll to the graph about half way down the article it shows the percent of each type of energy.  Renewable is about 5%.  Fossil is about 70%.

Renewable grew very slowly until about 2005 then sped up.  Its expansion jumped again in 2012.

Is renewable going to grow in similar numbers - a few percent a year, so it will take 70 years for it to replace most fossil fuel?

Or will renewable continue to accelerate its growth, so that it takes only a decade or so for it to be the majority of energy production?

The cost of renewables has gone down tremendously.  I imagine if all energy plants were being built today, renewables would have accelerated growth and take over quickly.  But given that most power plants already exist, you have to add renewables and remove existing plants.  That seems like a slow process as power plants age out of service.",1,0,1444683426,1444719220

So while democracy did exist prior to that, the modern era of democracy and all governments starts with the U.S. constitution and its first president.

Lots of people had a role in tech advancements.  What Edison did that was important was not his inventions.  It was his creation of a business designed to invent and create advancements.  Prior to Edison individuals had invented things when they were inspired.  Edison invented corporate research and development which is what turned technological advancement from a haphazard and occasional event to a constant process.",1,0,1444682398,1444719220
