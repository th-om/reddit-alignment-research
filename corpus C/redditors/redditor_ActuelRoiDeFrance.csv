cvx5mqz,0,t1_cvwppy3,ActuelRoiDeFrance,"There are two ways to look at the effect of Law: efficiency and rights protection. You seem to focus on the efficiency aspect. Law tend to promote efficiency when it is predictable, consistent and fair. However, a legal statute or doctrine can satisfy all three, be very efficient in short and long term, but fails to protect rights some of the time. The statements ""the Common Law system is efficient"" and ""the Common Law system is just"" involves very different kind of analysis. I don't think we can merge the two together without making extra normative commitments in order to find a way to compare individual rights with overall efficiency in economic/behavioral regulation.",1,0,1444673183,1444720373
cvmrq54,1,t3_3n9yjz,ActuelRoiDeFrance,"This might sound perverse at this time coming from a non-American. But shouldn't the American people be rationally ok with the occasional mass shooting here and there? There is an inherit risk of mass shootings anytime you allow broad and largely unrestricted freedom to own guns, but that's no different than the inherit risk of incarcerating innocent people anytime we set up a jail system, or the inherit risk of traffic accident if we embrace the convenience of automobile. These are the kind of cost benefit that many people would be ok with in a hypothetical social contract/veil of ignorance thought experiment. If you take freedom to be valuable, which it definitely is, then you have to compare the value of freedom with the probability that you or someone you care about will end up in one of these mass shootings.

Isn't this statement too strong and notoriously leads to deontologists biting the bullet on the Anne Frank scenario? Plus, Narveson seem to articulate a different conception of rights than the standard Kantian duty. 

Besides, very few pacifist actually hold such an unattainable position. Most pacifists, at least the Christian sort that I know of, seem to take a more utilitarian or virtue ethic approach to pacifism. ",1,0,1440172609,1444720373

cuaclao,0,t1_cuac4xc,ActuelRoiDeFrance,"the response is pretty cursory. Some of them don't really address the conceptual objection raised by Narveson, namely that moral rights imply the obligation to defend it with violent force, including war, if necessarly.  

I'm looking for specific argument addressing the idea why we ought to refrain from waging wars, even in the ""ideal"" just war scenario. So the idea is to either deny such implication exist by arguing we are only obligated to defend moral rights through non-violent means, and in fact we have the moral obligation not to use violence to defend violence. OR why the implication isn't really a problem for Pacifism. ",1,0,1440132871,1444720373
