I don't think that's remotely necessary for a risk reduction strategy to be strategically correct.  If you have a choice between having a 0.75 probability of losing $100 and having 0.95 probability of losing $100 and everything else is equal, you would be wrong (in the tactical sense) if you chose the latter.

>  should you fail to avoid the harm, wouldn't result in a far more catastrophic outcome than the original one would have been.

I think you'd really like Kant :p

Of course you can always invent scenarios in which an attempt to prevent a bad outcome ends up resulting in an even worse outcome.  The point is, with the right strategy those scenarios can all be unlikely enough that on average following the strategy turns out better than any other option.

> No, just that the victim is going to have a much better knowledge of their specific case.

Okay, but it seems to me that's not the point you argued for?  You made the blanket claim that (in my paraphrase) ""a rape victim cannot have done anything wrong [in any sense of the word] during the rape [which given context would include the events leading up to the rape]"".  But what this seems to be an argument for is ""we cannot identifiy the specific cases in which a rape victim did something wrong [in any sense of the word] during [and leading up to] their rape"".  Those two claims aren't equivalent.

For the record, I would strongly discourage actually talking about anything a rape victim might have done to increase their chances of being victimized *with* said victim, unless you knew them well and knew they were okay with it.

> Well if it had been ME I'd have done A, B and C and THEN that probably would NEVER have happened!""

But I'm not advocating anything of the sort.  I make no pretense that I'd be able to employ the optimum strategy in every case, especially in a highly stressful case where time is often very limited.  But I don't need to be able to personally do better to be able to tell when someone made mistake.

But I can tell you this: it would be wise to double check your calculations for what altitudes you need to start various manuvers at, especially if getting them wrong could mean having your multi-million dollar airplane slam into the ground.  I don't think the fact that if it had been me, the plane would have crashed *sooner* means I can't say that the pilot messed up.

- It is not possible for the decisions of an agent to impact the probability that agent will be raped.

cvtt6zu,0,t1_cvtpv9w,antimatter_beam_core,"I think the important distinction is between different kinds of ""wrong"".  There are two types of normative ""wrongness"":

- Being incorrect in terms of *decision theory*: the actions one took ran counter to ones personal utility.
- Being incorrect in terms of *ethics*: the actions one took ran counter to ethics.

For example, if I were to make decision to visit someone who had credibly said they would rape me, alone and without any way to defend my self or call for help^1 , then I think we can all agree that this dramatically increases my chances of getting raped.  Since I don't (and can't) want to get raped, in the absence of something else to make doing this a net positive, it runs counter to my personal utility, and is therefore ""wrong"" in the first sense.  However, since responsibility is in proportion to agency *over the act in question*, and the rapist has complete agency over whether or not I actually end up getting raped, where as I have none^2 , the rapist has sole responsibility.  Thus, I would not be *ethically* wrong if I got raped, even if I did something *tactically* wrong that allowed it to happen.

No.  I don't need to provide data to counter your data if your data is fault.  Which it clearly is, as the actual source for the data on the degree of trafficking says it can't measure the degree of trafficking.

> YOUNG girls traffic'd in from China, Romania, Eastern European and SEA countries likely don't speak German, English, or whatever the local language is. That makes it difficult to even understand where the authorities even are, much less escape their captors and race to the police.

That factor is constant with or without legalization.  I never said that it was *easy* to go to the authorities as a victim, I said that it was easi**er** under legalization.  If 1% of trafficking victims can go to the police before legalization, and 2% can after, then it's still really hard to go the police, but there'd be a big spike in victims going to the police after legalization (which the study you linked would interpret as a spike in trafficking).

> If you can provide contrary evidence, you are free to do so.

Again, I don't need to do so if your evidence is bad (which it is).  I only need to provide counter evidence if you provide some.

>  I can provide more studies proving the reality of the matter

Please do, but you should actually check where they get their data from and try to analyze it yourself first.  Studies often rely on questionable methods, especially in politically contentious fields like this.

cvq3m7a,0,t1_cvp86p9,antimatter_beam_core,"So I'm looking at your study, and I found this on page 4 of the PDF:

> Our empirical analysis is based on the UNODC [Report on Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns] data.

So how did [the UNODC report](http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/glotip/GLOTIP_2014_full_report.pdf) get it's data?

Well, the 2014 report (which is probably similar in methodology to the 2006 report cited) tells us that it's data comes from

> The statistical information was collected by UNODC in 
two ways: through a short, dedicated questionnaire distributed to Governments and by the collection of official information available in the public domain (national police reports, Ministry of Justice reports, national trafficking in persons reports, et cetera)

So in other words, most of this information is about how many cases of trafficking were *caught* by the police.  The report even acknowledges this:

> These figures represent officially detected offenders and victims... As for any crime, there is a large and unknown ‘dark figure’ of criminal activity that is never officially detected. As such, the figures reported here do not reflect the real extent of trafficking in persons

So the study you cited as evidence that human trafficking increased under legalized prostitution is based on another study that itself says it cannot actually measure human trafficking.

Further, there's an obvious reason why more people would be caught trafficking under legalization.  When prostitution is legal, the victims (and those who accidentally hire them) can go to the authorities without fear of arrest, and are thus  in theory more likely to be willing to do so.  Additionally, if the authorities are licensing and inspecting prostitution businesses, the police would be able to focus their efforts on *unlicensed* prostitution (which would include the bulk of trafficking), rather than all of it.  Thus, they would become more efficient at catching human traffickers.

I'm not claiming the reports you cited are evidence in favor of legalization.  However, they simply aren't remotely strong evidence that legalized prostitution causes an increase in human trafficking. ",1,0,1444141817,1444717440

Even accepting for a moment that Sander's is only talking about whatever ""assault weapons"" means this week, he's still in contradiction with the supreme court, because he said certain guns should be banned^1 *because* they are ""only used to kill people"" and not for hunting.  And since the supreme court has ruled that said rational isn't valid (at least in any sense that would be at all reasonable), ergo his position is in conflict conflicts with the SCotUS.

Assault rifles are by definition machine guns under the national firearms act.  No new civilian machine guns can be created for the last several decades.

You conflate ""assault rifle"" with ""assault weapon"" (easy mistake to make, considering the term ""assault weapon"" is designed to cause that confusion), but ""assault weapon"" is a largely meaningless term.  Realistically, it means ""scary gun"", and nothing more.

They don't exist, at least not in any way that you could enforce a ban on.  The only guns used exclusively to kill people are those bought, used to commit a homicide, and then destroyed.  Anyone can see that, so Sanders is talking about something else, clearly.
