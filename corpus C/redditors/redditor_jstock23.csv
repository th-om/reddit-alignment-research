cvwfmuw,0,t1_cvwb6yc,jstock23,"I'd do it the hard way. Look up some vegan recipes from native cultures. Those have been eaten for generations, so you can be comfortable with those for months, if not years. Then slowly look up those foods on wikipedia or something, and see if you're getting vitamins and minerals. Pencil and paper. Eat a variety of foods, and over the months you learn about each vitamin slowly, and figure out you're low in iron so you eat beans, etc. There's no easy way, unless you follow some person's guide, but those don't exist and can be wrong.",1,0,1444612080,1444724982

cvuvj9b,0,t1_cvut4v9,jstock23,"OK yeah I get what you're saying. I don't know much about fiber, but I know somewhat the concepts of gut bacteria and how it applies to this topic. From what I understand, different bacteria digest things in different ways, and break molecules into different products. While one bacteria may take a fiber molecule and break it down into two ""solid"" molecules, another may take that same molecule and break it down into two solid molecules and one gas molecule. This gas is a ""byproduct"" because it isn't used by the bacteria or the body.

So, the types of bacteria there are, and the ratios the appear in, determine how the fiber (or any other molecule) is transformed. Often gas byproducts represent non-efficient digestion, because all parts of the molecule aren't ""used"" somehow. So if some bacteria might be very good at digesting a certain type of food you eat a lot, it will proliferate. Then if you eat a different food, it may not do as well, and produce byproducts, if there aren't proper bacteria to digest it first. The small amounts of bacteria you already have to digest the new food (i.e. beans) will slowly proliferate. So as time goes on, you are more able to digest the new food properly. So, it's less of a human ""tolerance"" issue and more of a gut flora problem which solves itself slowly.

Perhaps randomly you and others eat foods that require a certain type of bacteria. This type of bacteria may coincidentally poorly digest the fiber in beans, and will only do so as a last resort. You have small amounts of the proper bean-digesting bacteria, but not enough to handle large amounts. It makes theoretical sense that in American culture, beans are very associated with flatulence, because an American diet is also a low-fiber diet and so probably ill equipped in the bacterial realm.",1,0,1444494198,1444724982
