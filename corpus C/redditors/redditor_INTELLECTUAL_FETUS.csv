cv86gf6,1,t3_3lowg9,INTELLECTUAL_FETUS,"I'm not a fan calling a metaphysical belief of reality being constantly changing and in flux a ""buddhist"" belief. Theres a long history of that belief in European history, starting with the Pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus and culminating with Hegel and Marx.",1,0,1442777245,1444730236
cv0yvln,1,t3_3kv9bn,INTELLECTUAL_FETUS,"In Athens, they had 300 state owned slaves, typically scythians, who were responsible for enforcing laws, arresting and holding criminals, crowd control, and herding adult males into the ekkasia for assemblies. They had slaves because when they used local citizens, The athenians would either bribe or hire their own police force, which needless to say led to chaos and unrest.",21,0,1442220624,1444730236
cv0yben,1,t3_3ktijr,INTELLECTUAL_FETUS,"In Ancient Greece, there were no ""professional"" diplomats but were rather citizens of a polis elected by the ekkasia or appointed by the ruling political body, depending on the style of government. These citizens are usually selected from the Aristocracy or someone of great importance so that the target city state knows its serious.

Upon arrival, the elected diplomat meets with their proxenos, who are citizens of the host polis with special ties to the guest polis, who then arranges mettings with the elites of the city state and discusses the matter to determine potential support of his initiative and tries to persuade enough of them to support the initiative. Then the diplomat makes his case to the ekkasia (or the ruling council) to convince them of the initiative. The people in the ekkasia voices their concerns and makes arguments for/against and then a vote is made to determine to support or reject the initiative. 

Mind you this only applied to ancient greek city states with some form of democratic representation, this does not apply to tyrannies or kingdoms.

You can get a glimpse of how this diplomacy was done reading Thucydides' histories (of the peloponesian war).
