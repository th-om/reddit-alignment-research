Let's take /r/politics for example. Assume I am a user replying to a thread about socialised healthcare. I believe it's a great thing and I want others to believe that too. I write a post outlining the benefits of socialised healthcare. 

Here's where karma comes into it. **I want more people to see my post**. That's important - the more views the larger the reach I'll have to share my opinion (which I believe to be right above all else).

More upvotes = more exposure to your views. I suspect that this is the kind of thinking that people who browse subreddits which encourages strong opinions such as /r/politics and /r/atheism - so of course people learn how to game the system. 

You and I both KNOW that if you were to defend the GOP or Conservatism you'd get downvoted to hell in politics, so you just don't bother. One chooses instead to write pandering bullshit in the hopes of upvotes. ",1,1,1444727100,1444731020

I so often see someone post a problem that women face and the response is often ""but men have problems too!""

Yes. You're right. Everyone has problems. In this particular discussion we're talking about this issue that affects women. I don't talk about the welfare of elephants when I'm talking about my aquarium either.",1,1,1444726838,1444731020
