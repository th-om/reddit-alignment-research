cvxi3ne,0,t1_cvxh9m4,CuilRunnings,"It seems as if the people at the top truly view the moderators to be the most important group on reddit, as opposed to content creators or the voting community as a whole as the content sorters.  Why do you think that is?  What sort of evidence do you think directly contradicts that?",1,0,1444691650,1444727570

cvxh8iq,0,t1_cvxh23n,CuilRunnings,"Using terms with endearment towards me does not effectively address the association between /r/blackpower, Farrakhan, and viewing racist violence favorably.  How would you feel about a /r/whitepower subreddit talking about how great David Duke is?  And to top it off, David Duke goes out of his way to urge violence.  So I'm not really sure in what world ""PC BRO""ing positive thoughts about racial violence is EVER ok.",0,0,1444690234,1444727570

cvxgyvv,0,t1_cvxguzq,CuilRunnings,"It looks like they hold Farrakhan, someone who called for 10,000 blacks to rise up and kill white people, in a positive light.  This sort of racist garbage should definitely be behind some sort of content warning.",2,0,1444689807,1444727570
cvxgv8x,0,t1_cvxg277,CuilRunnings,"NP, this subreddit doesn't get enough traffic.  Anyway, to answer your question more fully: the reason why the middle class has ""stagnated"" (not including increasing medical benefits and costs) is primarily due to globalization.  This has had the [overwhelming positive effect of fighting poverty world-wide](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/wordpoverty2-600x387.jpg).  But it is hard for US jobs to keep pace, especially when the lower classes have 15% more children than those who contribute to society.  Regardless, now that the world has caught up a bunch, I think we will see more even growth.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further, and cheers.",1,0,1444689648,1444727570
cvxg1xc,0,t1_cvxf9l2,CuilRunnings,"The businesses did not birth those people, they were not responsible for those people through their childhood leaving them adults with no discernible skills or abilities, why exactly do you view this as the responsibility of business?  To be honest, we should thank these businesses for employing these otherwise unemployable people, and lowering the bill that those who contribute to society would otherwise be forced to bear.

Also: look at total spending... it's not low.  Also, ""demand"" is too often seen as the economic equivalent of ""free energy.""  It is not.",1,0,1444688351,1444727570
