But on the other hand it may not be too late. What prompted you to choose this topic? You are probably reacting to some view you've heard or read. Perhaps it's the commonplace that ""everyone is entitled to their own opinion."" Finding a source that expresses this view gives you flint to strike your steel against, and a starting place in your research.

I don't know of a particular source off the top of my head, but in terms of a little direction for your searching, it sounds like the topic your argument falls under would be rhetoric: convincing someone that one's opinion has merit.

Good luck.  ",1,0,1444273680,1444720257
cvqxl8z,1,t3_3nrdbp,jjf,"The Puritans had a profound influence on U. S. culture, including   its desire for political independence.

Broadly speaking, there were and are three Christian church polities: episcopal, presbyterian, and congregationalist. Episcopal polity is hierarchical: a church is overseen by a priest, who is governed by a bishop, who is ruled by an archbishop. Authority is concentrated in one man and is conferred downward by appointment. Presbyterian polity is republican: local congregations elect elders who jointly form a session. Sessions call or appoint pastors. So authority is held by the session, but it is made up of elected representatives. Congregational polity is democratic: local congregations vote directly on issues effecting that particular church, including calling or dismissing a pastor. Authority rests ultimately with the people of the congregation.

Puritans explicitly rejected episcopal polity, and favored either presbyterian or congregationalist. The analogy between church polity and political government was not lost on the powers of the day. When James I assumed the throne, Puritans in England were hopeful that his Scottish Presbyterian background would incline him more favorably toward them. James, who loved theological disputation, convened Presbyterian and Anglican ministers to hear them debate how English religion should be organized at the Hampton Court Conference. At the conclusion of this, to the great disappointment of the Puritans, James astutely observed, ""No bishop, no king.""

So the Puritans are philosophically disposed toward representative self-government. On top of that, the conditions of their Massachusetts Bay Charter gave them broad leave to govern themselves, so they have both the motive and the opportunity for it.

It's also worth mentioning that the Puritans believed all children, regardless of gender or social rank, should be educated at least enough to read the Bible well. This led them to establish schools in the northeast, both primary (in fact they made a statute that any community of 100 families had to hire a schoolmaster) and secondary (they founded Harvard for the training of ministers). The priority given to literacy contributes to the rise of print culture in the northeast of the United States, which is enormously important in the movement for independence. The broadsheets become the battleground of ideas, which the literate public is invited to follow and join. 

I'm sure there are other significant contributing factors. Look at Perry Miller's *The New England Mind*. It's older (1939), but a seminal text.",2,0,1444189908,1444720257

Yes, there are. And no, I can't say with certainty. But I can say it with a high degree of probability.

I'd invite anyone to compare the number of deaths by knife or bomb to the number of gun deaths in America. A gun is a tool to make killing easier. Lacking that tool, a certain percentage (probably a large percentage) of violent people wouldn't be able to act on their urges or intentions. Some few might make bombs. Some more might stab people. But right now any nutjob with the will to do it can get his hands on a machine designed to rapidly spit death, and kill three or ten or twelve or twenty people before anyone has time to react. The pasty internet troll can drop the trained combat veteran with seven rounds before the soldier can even reach him. What would that kid's chances have been if he had a knife? 

I can say this with certainty: without easy access to guns, there would be far fewer violent deaths in America, for the simple fact that violently killing someone would be far harder to do. ",2,0,1443895249,1444720257
cvmui75,0,t1_cvmtx91,jjf,"> Increased access to guns doesn't just magically make people more violent.

No, but it does make it easier for violent people to kill. That is the entire purpose of a gun: it is a tool to make killing easier. 

So, case in point, the basement-dwelling loner who wants to get off 4chan and make his mark on the world would not have the strength or fortitude to beat or knife 10 people to death. But with a handful of guns, he can do it quite easily. 

The violent nature is present with or without a gun. The gun just makes it far easier to carry out.  ",2,0,1443889932,1444720257
cvmtm3p,1,t3_3n9yjz,jjf,"I think you're looking for a rational explanation for a view that stems more from emotional and identity than from logic. 

Gun ownership is a fundamental part of American cultural identity. For many, it symbolizes independence and self-reliance: we will protect ourselves and not depend on our government to do it, and we stand ready to menace our government should they ever grow tyrannical (theoretically, anyway -- remember, this is about a symbolic statement). 

So any attempt to control or limit guns, by a kind of symbolic association, feels like an attempt to control or limit **freedom** and **independence**. 

Even the staunchest gun advocate cannot ignore that the U. S. alone among the developed nations of the world regularly has mass shootings, and has a homicide rate far higher than other countries of the developed world. The very simple difference is that in the U. S., it is easy to procure a gun, and in most of those countries it is not. Sorry to dash cold water on a lot of half-cocked theories about how civil we'd be if everybody wore a six-shooter on his hip, but obviously if we were to make it hard to purchase guns, we -- like the rest of the world that has done this -- would see fewer mass killings and fewer homicides, for the very simple fact that it's much easier to kill someone with a gun. 

But of course if we were to limit or control guns, we'd lose a part of our uniquely American mythos. This would affect political attitudes as well. I have no doubt that an unarmed America would be a less independent and self-reliant America.   

The question is, how many lives each year is our American mythos worth?  ",-1,0,1443888393,1444720257

ctsneui,1,t3_3fuo6p,jjf,"In one of the sub-threads, and argument went back and forth over how to determine if Planned Parenthood ""profited"" from selling fetal body parts. If they make money on a single transaction (e.g., sell a fetal heart for $100 when it costs them $70 to store & transport it), is that profiting? Does that break the law?

Some argued ""no"" because PP might use the extra revenue from that transaction to cover expenses elsewhere. /u/Corranus said that PP turned a profit, $44 million he though, last year. I looked that up in [PP's own financial report](http://issuu.com/actionfund/docs/annual_report_final_proof_12.16.14_/0) -- go to page 25/28 in the doc -- and in fact in 2014 the PP national office made $36 million in profit last year, and the PP affiliates made another $91 million, for a total profit of $127 million for the organization in the fiscal year ending June 2014. 

So how does that change the question? Planned Parenthood plus all its affiliates made $127 million profit last year, some (probably very small portion) of that from selling fetal body parts for more than their necessary costs (as evidenced by PP officers negotiating prices and talking about ""revenue"" and ""helping the bottom line"").

It seems like by any definition, the organization did profit from selling fetal body parts. Maybe they did not profit as much as they could have (/u/intravenus_de_milo claims that the market could sustain much higher prices if they wanted to charge them), but they did profit some.

If they are making excess money selling fetal body parts in order to cover their losses elsewhere, how is that not profiting from the sale of fetal body parts? 

So it seems in part there's a legal definition to be clarified here. Does ""profit"" refer only to an individual transaction (I sell for $100 something that costs me $70), or does it refer to the organization's bottom line (but my business ended in the red, so I did not ""profit from"" that transaction)? If the first, then PP clearly profited from selling fetal body parts, right?
