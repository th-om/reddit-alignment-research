>I accuse you of raping me.

>Now your life is ruined. It's so stupid, and the women that make the false accusations walk out scotts free.

The poster is making a dangerously false assumption here that the accusation of rape always leads to the person who is accused being instantly assumed to be guilty. This is false, and as /u/blow_hard the flip side of this is the vast amounts of instances when the person who comes out with a rape allegation isn't believed, and often times ostracized in the community (with the incident swept under the rug). If you want examples, you can look at nearly every rape allegation against a college football athlete.

You're correct that people who make false rape allegations are not in the same category as people who are rape victims. That's exactly the problem with the statement /u/spiritbx made -- it throws every rape accusation, false or true, in the same category and places the one being accused as the victim regardless. If you follow /u/spiritbx's logic, you are going to assume every rape allegation is false. Obviously, this is far from true.",3,0,1441762188,1444726700
