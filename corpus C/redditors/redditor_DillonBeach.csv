cvh9fam,0,t1_cvgz38q,DillonBeach,Never heard of Confessionalism. Sure enough:  The repartition of assembly seats on a confessional base in the Middle East was inaugurated by the Ottoman Empire. Thx for turning me on to that. That's some old school shit. ,2,0,1443470744,1444731954
cvgx9sj,0,t1_cvgrxmp,DillonBeach,"Thx. It sounds like a holdover from an older time, like something that was codified during the Ottoman Empire-a diluted version of Sharia law.  It's great that this change has happened. ",2,0,1443452720,1444731954
cvgqtwy,1,t3_3mgxho,DillonBeach,"The idea that a government believes it can censor something today and not have it read or seen is laughable.  Pretty much any movie or book is available online, Unless Lebanon has some serious China or North Korea-like  internet blockage going on.

Sounds like there are laws on the books not allowing inter-marriage between different religions in Lebanon. Something about ""laws of their sects"". ELi5 this please. 

On a positive note it seems like the judiciary, notwithstanding it's corruption, is still operating.

cvesryw,1,t3_3mgl2k,DillonBeach,"There are some very disturbing and ignorant comments on this post. 

If the Bulgarian Orthodox Church is anything like the Serbian Orthodox Church, then very little Christianity will be in evidence. It's more like  identifying with a footbAll team, with logo of Christ, but with none of his teachings. The Serbian Orthodox Church made matters worse during the Kosovo conflict, imagining these guys will behave in the same way. ",2,0,1443277431,1444731954
cv94hy2,1,t3_3lswk2,DillonBeach,"Reminded of the ""coalition of the Willing"" during the invasion of Iraq by the Cheney regime. A bunch of these pacific islands signed on because they got payouts from the U.S.  

seems like their leaders are pursuing short-sighted policies and aligning themselves with players that don't care about climate change. ",-1,0,1442851901,1444731954

If you tell them you are a Christian Arab, they're mind will be totally blown, cause they have no comprehension that there are Christians in the Middle East, or that Christiany began in the ME.

cv4a56o,0,t1_cv3bo2u,DillonBeach,"That was a pretty rambling letter, but the ambassador appears to like Leabanon. Think of me as a time traveler. I left Lebanon a 100 years ago and now I've come back, we'll sort of. 

I noticed that it's mainly English and some Arabic on this sub. The English is really good, like its everyone's first language. Has French fallen by the wayside amongst the young, or is everyone still tri-lingual?  I'm thinking of what happened in Vietnam, a former French colony, and no one speaks French their anymore.
