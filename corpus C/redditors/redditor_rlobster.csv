cvlixny,0,t1_cvlgzy2,rlobster,It is however not possible to apply for asylum in Germany from outside of Germany. I think if we want to avoid situations like the current one in the future that needs to be changed.,2,0,1443781762,1444728124
cvi522m,0,t1_cvi40ti,rlobster,"I guess I worded myself poorly. I wanted to point out that one of the biggest churches in Europe has a weird stance on sex as well, without the killing of course.",1,0,1443539838,1444728124
cvi3ptq,0,t1_cvhumkb,rlobster,"I don't know about you, but when I grew up I had our catholic priests tell us that the only time you are allowed to have sex is when you are trying to get pregnant. In a married couple of course.",1,0,1443537698,1444728124

cvi0tk2,0,t1_cvhz68y,rlobster,Exactly official administrations and police force should try and prevent situations that facilitate or enable escalations and then make sure to arrest and prosecute anyone that breaks the law.,4,0,1443532324,1444728124
cvi0qzv,0,t1_cvhyia5,rlobster,So the refugees aren't poor enough / too rich? I mean there's plenty of people complaining that they are too uneducated and poor to contribute to society in any shape or form in the near future. Wouldn't it be easier for us to integrate the wealthier with potential higher education levels?,12,0,1443532167,1444728124
cvi0f7d,0,t1_cvhybe4,rlobster,"I agree. There will be problems and not everyone will be integrated nicely. Personally I am in favor of taking in at least a certain number of refugees now and also in the future. I feel that fair quotas could be good way to prevent people from some countries to feel that they have to bear a common responsibility alone. If the end result of this situation is going to be that there will be refugees living in our societies (and it most definitely looks that way), I think that we would do ourselves a great disservice of not welcoming anyone with open arms that is willing to play by the rules and pull their weight.",0,0,1443531404,1444728124
cvi024e,0,t1_cvhz0yk,rlobster,"There are certainly reasons for restricting the influx of refugees to Europe, especially if can be expected that integration is going to be hard. I still think that looking at Gulf countries as an example for wise policy decisions is risky at best. 

Also I reject your statement that people from that region absolutely refuse to assimilate whatever that entails. I am personally friends or acquainted with a number of Syrians or people of Syrian origin, some having come as asylum seekers (not recently) and others as economic migrants. They are just regular people as far as I can tell, work their jobs and live their life. Granted these are for the most part very highly educated people, but it shows that there is nothing in their genes or water over there that prevents Arabs them from being decent members of a western society.",1,0,1443530529,1444728124
cvhzsot,0,t1_cvhyiin,rlobster,"Maybe I misunderstood you, your comment seemed to imply that the current German government is part of the Left. And yes the CDU is not the traditional immigration friendly party, which makes statements as how Germany is basically left wing country so absurd.",2,0,1443529869,1444728124
cvhy13m,0,t1_cvhwfw1,rlobster,"What kind of question is that? Obviously German laws should be enforced, I have yet to see a person suggest something else.
