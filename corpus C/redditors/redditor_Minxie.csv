I couldn't contain myself any longer at that, this was so well done.",179,0,1444675757,1444728087
cvwtzkn,0,t1_cvws3n3,Minxie,Because there is no point they are always at around 4-5 % like the Greens. They are mostly gonna win four seats or something.,0,0,1444651977,1444728087
cvwgqv1,0,t1_cvwet5r,Minxie,"They have conservative editorials and their corporate owners are definitely Conservative.

However they have a great number of columnists like Andrew Coyne who write scathing editorials all the time, and they run critical stuff of the Conservatives all the time. 

Conrad Black just had a front page article on National Post saying the Conservative were scraping the bottom of the barrel in pandering.",15,0,1444614037,1444728087
cvw8gfx,0,t1_cvw7nzb,Minxie,"Losing and increasing your total by 5 percent is pretty much losing, especially when your left-wing opposition has well over 50%.",2,0,1444599237,1444728087
cvw50du,0,t1_cvw3wht,Minxie,"That is what I'm thinking. Like you look at Angus Reid which has the Cons up by 1 or 2 points in Ontario, then Nanos where the Libs are up by 10. 

Whose right?",4,0,1444593899,1444728087
cvw4zfl,1,t3_3od3bs,Minxie,"I was just looking at all the regionals of all the last released polls, and it seems one side you have Nanos, Forum, Leger and Innovative all saying the Liberals have a good lead in Ontario, and then you have EKOS, Mainstreet, Angus Reid saying it's a two way race, and that seems to determine who is leading in all these polls.",3,0,1444593861,1444728087

cvvwlm5,1,t3_3oax3k,Minxie,"I get really upset when I see youngsters in this subreddit mentioning how many ""olds"" they see in the polls. Like, all my grandparents are not voting Conservative, peeps, neither are my parents. They aren't all conservative.

In fact I doubt 50% of them are, according to many polls combined support for the NDP/Liberal in the older demographic is more than Conservative support.",6,0,1444580600,1444728087
cvvw9e3,1,t3_3obrsj,Minxie,"Pretty much the opposite of CBC poll tracker.

You know, I see constant people saying Conservatives are always underestimated in polls, they will win more seats, etc. I think projections like this underestimate the Liberals.",1,0,1444579990,1444728087
