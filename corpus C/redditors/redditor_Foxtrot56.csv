cvxoawz,0,t1_cvxo1vd,Foxtrot56,It's not getting upvotes though. It seems like there are lots of these from both sides but they aren't very popular.,1,1,1444701402,1444716358
cvxnaz4,1,t3_3oj0uo,Foxtrot56,What do you mean? More liberal people here? It probably increased in popularity.,1,1,1444699873,1444716358
cvxkrap,0,t1_cvx2pus,Foxtrot56,Because you have to draw a line somewhere and if that line is conception then I don't think you have thought about the problem much.,1,1,1444695974,1444716358
cvxkqot,0,t1_cvx4fry,Foxtrot56,Yea and I am saying that it is a massive coincidence. Why is it that they always pick the riskiest plan? Why not wall the walkers in?

cvx2ext,0,t1_cvx26bk,Foxtrot56,I don't agree with the brain activity being a sign of personhood and right but you will be glad to hear that about 99 percent of abortions occur before 24 weeks.
