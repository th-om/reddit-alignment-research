If you want to read about the generic ""Bad Guy(s)"" that we grow up hearing how evil they are, you can always turn to any NBC, MSN, CNN, FOX, WSJ, WaPo, NYT, etc. publication and read about them.  Yet, if a few people want to focus on what needs to change inside the West, it is odd?

I don't know about you as a reader, but I don't really care about what manufactured controversy is happening in Russia or China.  Those events will usually not impact me.  However, a critical eye towards my own country (and allies) does interest me as does a critical eye towards [media establishments](https://theintercept.com/2014/08/12/nprs-dina-temple-raston-passed-cia-funded-nsa-contractor-independent-fear-monger-snowden-reporting/) that might be less critical than I might like.

So to sum it up, I would say those people you mentioned, in addition to organizations like the Intercept and Wikileaks, fill a much needed niche to keep our own citizens aware of things happening in our own country.",0,0,1444695610,1444719889

How about his articles or books that he has written?

Do you just dislike criticism of your country?  I'm not sure what your view is.  Are you expecting every journalist to cover every location?  Shouldn't there be at least *some* journalists (or other actors) that exclusively cover Western nations?",1,0,1444694346,1444719889

Examples?  I'm familiar with some of his work and I haven't come to that same conclusion that you have.",1,0,1444687415,1444719889
cvucifz,1,t3_3o4gb0,TheSonofLiberty,"Review your notes after every class!  Don't do it right after class, but do it at say dinner time.  Then when the weekend hits, try to put aside some time to review the class notes from the week (in addition to preparing for the next week).  Have you been keeping up with the readings *before* the lecture for that class starts?

I was literally in your exact same position a few years ago.  I'm still in university, just about to graduate in less than 3 semesters.  I've just been doing the readings before the assigned lecture, going over the notes or readings depending on the professor (i.e. some professors like to use the book for their exams, others like their own notes, some both), doing the homework (usually) well before it is due, etc.

Also, are you taking too many hours because you feel you should get out faster? 

Please feel free to ask any questions.",2,0,1444437890,1444719889

Is there not a possibility that he is just well read in terms of economics and just finds that the negative view of capitalism is more grounded in reality?

Also, why do we have this die-hard view of a degree as being the only path to being competent in a subject, let alone being an expert?  While I haven't taken a public relations major in university, I have read many books about public relations, so much so that I can clearly explain the concept of the industry and propaganda to friends that will listen.  Why do I need to be a ""public relations expert"" or degree holder just to explain those ideas and my critiques about them?",3,0,1444414475,1444719889
