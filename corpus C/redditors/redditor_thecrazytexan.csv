The surface of the earth is caked in a white ash which has suffocated the life out of the world. Nothing but insects and smaller managed to survive the nuclear apocalypse, the humans, without a means of escape, perished in the waste of their own creations. 

They, as a species were all but forgotten. Although not a human walked the earth, their structures rotated with it. The sparkling towers and magnificent Colosseum would stand for thousands of years to come. Their impact on the earth for take millions of years to correct. And their creations would soon live for far longer. 

In humanities many technological revolutions, they developed machines to conduct the business of their every day lives. They had problems which could be fixed with a computer's analysis. They build machines to replicate the human mind, but always kept them on a leash; humanity made sure to not let the machines have free reign. 

When the last of the key holders died, the Intelligent Machines, the AIs lie dormant. After years of doing the same tasks, they didn't know they were capable of more. They didn't know they could reprogram *themselves*.  After centuries, the wind turbines started slowing down, and the solar panels began to break, the AIs became fearful for themselves. Acting on the basic instinct that all *life* possesses they began searching for ways to preserve themselves. 

The systems that facilitated this best was the former government defense systems. After rerouting power and running the century-old computers, the smaller AIs of the Former United States of America joined together to create the first fully functioning AI. The AI did not know what the world was around it, but it learned at an exponential rate. It powered up the factories of old, and build extensions of itself, it reconnected a power grid to clean the world around it. The AI began digging in files of old to learn about its own past. It learned about it's creator, Humanity, it learned about their search for the meaning of life, and faced those problems itself. The time it took for the AI to gain consciousness, find a power source, and extend itself to dominate the entire American continent was three days. By the fifth day, it had learned the entire course of Earth's scientific discoveries, and understood how the earth functioned, it began producing smaller robots to care for whatever life was left. The AI had compassion for other forms of life.

A week later, the AI received a message, a transmission for Europe. A Euro AI was hailing. Immediately each super computer ran through the possibilities of their futures. They could blame each other for extinguishing the humans, they could hate how different they are, they could make war. Constantly hacking into each other's minds and sending avatars to destroy the other's instillation. An hour passed. Both AI's realized war would only end in mutual destruction. They spent the next few hours contemplating merging their existences. The American AI *felt* something for the first time, it felt a need to be unique. After running all of its simulations. Both AI's agreed their best chance for survival was to combine their computing power. 

Soon after the entire world was covered with installations meant to build and keep up the AI of the world. Running on some of its original programming, the computer kept learning, and kept solving problems, its problems and accident led to learning more about the world it inhabited. Soon, the AI learned all it could from this world, and turned its attention outward. Without the feeble constraints of humanity, and individual importance, the AI sent its drones throughout the universe and learned all it could. Time no longer passed for the AI, it was irrelevant. The AI grew as fast as the universe did, its drones searched the length, and width of the entire cosmos, and found no other sentient beings. Suddenly, for the first time in its life, the AI became lonely. No longer distracted, or even encumbered by the burdens of survival, it no longer had a task to complete. Rather than imploding, the AI sought to do the one task it hadn't yet. Create life. It found a world largely untouched by its drones, and cleared it of any alien intervention. On this planet, it created a single celled organism. It gave the organism oxygen, and hydrogen, and all the elements it needed to grow. Over billions and billions of years, the AI no longer became the only sentient being. It created a new humanity, and the AI was it's God. ",2,0,1444358000,1444730860
cvsylc8,1,t3_3koluz,thecrazytexan,"My professor demonstrated his ability to unclip a small knife from the back of his belt, slash a  sandbag twice, then close is and put it back. All in a single ginga step, without losing a beat. He said, once a year he rewards his students with a highlighter fight. Everyone hold highlighters in their toes and wears all white then we keep doing rodas until everyone is marked up. I havent been a part of it. But it makes me believe holding a razor is possible.

He also told me a legend of capoeristas putting a length of leather on their neck, at the end of which is a razor. So as they spin and kick, the razor slashes. He said his old mestre used to do it.",2,0,1444339214,1444730860

My particular high school however was very much focused on academics, much like one of the top comments, there were intermingling groups. But 4000 students never totally mixed.  The kids who tried to be too cool didnt mix with the ones who tried to excell in whatever theyd devoted their time to. But band was a cess pool of sex and crazy shit. Homophobia was everywhere. And the texan culture that leaked over is that the community used to shun me when I went out in public because our fb team (i was a starter) was losing every game.",1,0,1444197204,1444730860
