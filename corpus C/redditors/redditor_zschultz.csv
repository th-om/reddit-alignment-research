Well there is a Chinese flood myth. But I wonder if that really fits in the flood mentioned in the Bible.

First one: One of the ancient lords Gong Gong lost in a major war for the throne over the land (entire middle kingdom of China), in rage he smashed his head against the pillar holding the sky and rain fall, flood follows...

Second one: During the reign of King Yao the whole land was plagued with flood (perhaps due to the previous flood but perhaps not). And after 13 YEARS of struggle the situation was eased by a hydraulic genius (later became king, Yu the Great), who torn down many previous dams and cleared a path for the water to flow freely eastward into the ocean.

As for Egypt, doesn't River Nile flood every year? That would surely leave tons of flood tales.

I personally find the approach ""find some prehistory flood record elsewhere on the planet, claim it an evidence for the Biblical flood"". No matter how many evidence of a prehistorical global flood was found, that can only serve to prove one thing: there was a time when there were many floods. I mean why not? The last Ice Age ended some 12,000 years ago, of course there gonna be climate change and flood, those XXXXing ice melted! LOL. ",2,0,1444373109,1444722104

Wonderful liberal arts and science education, possible route for Nobel Prize for those who can pay.

Surely wonderful enough.

Still there are enough complain from young lecturers on the burden of getting a tenure.
