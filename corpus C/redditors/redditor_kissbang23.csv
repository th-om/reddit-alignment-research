cvwq7z9,0,t1_cvwpuof,kissbang23," I also hear my voice in my head and naturally punctuate to portray character. I've always felt I had to intentionally not punctuate things because people my age act like it's uncool or looks needy or something idk. I hate how people are always so polarized nowadays, its like people are correcting you like they're Einstein or they've intentionally gone full derp... Btw on my phone so not a great example ;) ",9,0,1444636289,1444721975

Their calendar navigation is crap (if you can find it)and they are clearly spending all their advert profits on coke and hookers... Which their overworked webdev has apparently been sticking his face in before their execs force him to cram an impressive plethora of mismatched code, imgs & content into another seemingly meaningless, overloaded page that somehow manages to blend in with the rest of the website. Honestly I can't really tell if it's intentional or not, they're either genius or really, really strung out. 

But they still have the most up to date and inclusive content for tampa, way better than anything else I've seen",-1,0,1443939950,1444721975
cvnhyx0,1,t3_3nczkx,kissbang23,"Its way to late for anyone to see it but I'll never have a better reason to share this. I was raised in the same neighborhood with my aunt & uncle's little girls for the majority of my childhood and they had this car they refused to get rid of, I have no idea what it was but it was a huge boat of a two door that was so old that one of my earliest memories was watching the road go by through a giant hole in the floor-board (or lack thereof) on the back seat passenger side. Easily large kid sized, definitely went around in that vehicle several times a week until I left the state as a teenager. 

To make matters worse, there was a wasp nest somewhere in the cushions of the back seat,big  southern wasps, though of us ever got stung that I can remember... The AC never worked in my lifetime and naturally we saw a few wasps fly out on drives, but I shit you not we'd pick up a few passengers a week no matter where we were stopped in town. They flew right in to the back seat and squeezed into wherever like it was their damn car to begin with. One time we were stopped at a light in the next town over and this guy just swoops in like he knows us.  Who knows how long that car had been in that area, they probably took more rides than I did.

I'm not hitting on you but I wanted to mention that, with all due respect to the artists, you are younger looking, more built, and boyishly cuter in the irl pic than any of the recreations capture... Maybe your cat is just making you look good though ;) ",2,0,1443629696,1444721975
