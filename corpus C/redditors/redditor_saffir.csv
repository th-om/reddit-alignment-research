The universities are not facing problems. They have literally so many candidates that they can turn away applicants while charging exorbitant prices to those that come.

The issue that does exist is that students only want education at the best schools without paying top prices. You can literally get a Harvard or MIT education FREE online; you can also get a college-level education by going to community colleges, which is a fraction of the price. Or even non-public-ivy universities, for example in California there's the CSU system, which is a tier below the UC system. But no, everyone wants the UCLA or Berkeley name on their resume, but they'll settle for UCSD, UC Davis, or UC Irvine. No one gives a shit about the CSULB that costs half as much despite being better than UCI, because it's not a UC.

>state governments don't always act in the interest of the people

You think the Federal government does? In my state, my voice is one out of 12 million. In the United States, my voice is one out of 121 million. Literally 10x as much. Where do you think my voice has more influence? 

Nope, you're wrong... it's actually the local level, where my voice is one in 40 THOUSAND. I can write my mayor and actually expect a response. Hell, if it's a good enough letter, he'll probably invite me to his office. I can barely get anything more than a cookie-cutter form back from my governor, and you think anyone at the Federal level even reads my letters?

>Is it truly the priority of the people of Wisconsin to spend $220 million on a new stadium while simultaneously cutting $300 million from the state's university system? Or are those the priorities of the powers that be?

Then vote to change those who are in charge of the University of Wisconsin. You think putting the Federal government in charge will change that? I don't think you understand how our government works...",1,1,1444694270,1444720620

As a Californian, I don't give a shit about what Wisconsin does with their money. And that's the primary reason it should be handled at the state level, not the Federal level. You know what priorities there are for your state, I know what priorities there are for my state. 

If I were to put in a proposition to, say, move all funding from Wisconsin to California, it'd probably pass since the population of California is seven times larger than Wisconsin.
