cvwvqeu,0,t1_cvwjbut,stolt,"> controlled experiments are not readily available,

I disagree on this. Behavioral economics is a body of research which has a large amount lab-done research in it. Maybe if the statement could be amended to say ""properly controlled experiments are not readily available in fields of econ other than behavioral econ""

 That is also true for geology, astronomy, and climatology. isn't it? 

> You can try to control for some variables in an experiment, but the variables are connected to each other. 

That is why multicolinarity testing and endogeneity testing exist. So, I think the real thing that needs to be said here is more like:

* *""You can try to control for some variables in an experiment, but the variables ~~are~~* ***might be*** *connected to each other*, ***which is a thing that can and should be tested statistically prior to publication of results***.

I'm not really sure that this is in any way true. If something exists, there should, in principle, be observable evidence of it existing. 

> Well no obviously but should you accept an empirical proposition not supported by facts?

In principle, empirical evidence is the means by which you determine that a theoretically determined hypothesis might be true, or might not be. 

I guess, you mean to ask, ""would you empirically test things which have no theoretical basis to them, and no specific hypothesis to prove or disprove?"" Am I right?  (the answer would be ""no, the first rule of empirical methodology is to have hypotheses to test in the place, and that these hypotheses should be grounded in theory somewhere)

Is this line pulled directly from the 2nd Hayek vs Keynes rap battle? 

In any case, I have a question, if statistical research ""confirms existing biases"" is that also true for climate science? I often hear that said about climate change. 

Also, I'd like to ask another question about this supposed confirmation of bias. Does it mean, in principle that there would be consensus among empirical researchers within the economic field? Why isn't all the econometric research be saying the same thing about things like ways in which financial markets work? or the employment effects of the minimum wage? would this be due to diverging biases?

cvvoas3,0,t1_cvurehn,stolt,"Umm, because I live in a 1st world country. 

In the country where I live, a lot of the quality of life that we have comes from the fact that we have universal health care, where we have real doctors, instead of say....snake oil salesmen. 

Because part of our quality of life consists of that people can all go to university for next to nothing, which was not the case in the old days. 

Because the church can't send out strongmen to kill in the name of christ, like they used to in the old days. 

Because part of our quality of life consists of that there are no further marauding bands of Franks and Goths and Vikings, (nor Russians and Germans for that matter), a noted improvement from the way things were in the immediate aftermath of the fall of rome.  

Running water, computers, and the world wide web are also kind of enjoyable.
