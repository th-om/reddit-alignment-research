To my mind, there is enough evidence pointing towards determinism that I'm okay with speaking confidently of its likelihood, and with looking more closely at policies based upon its implications (than I would looking at policies based upon the implications of free will).",1,0,1444718132,1444730665

Value-added is related to the gain that an employer actually enjoys as a result of the labor of an employee (estimated value-added being related to the projected surplus of a sale at a projected market value).

Ultimately, capitalism is designed to defraud employees, because designed to pay wages far less than the element I just described (which I called value-added).",1,0,1444713430,1444730665
cvxur0b,1,t3_3ois5l,Kirkayak,"Irrespective of Dennett's reservations (in his second video), I hold that it's imperative to hamstring the idea of free will in the popular imagination, insofar as such is both untrue, *and* is also used to:

* justify the idea of punishment for the sake of punishment

* justify neglecting the betterment of environments, thereby slowing or completely hindering the heightened optimization of human well-being and happiness

On the other side of things, it's probably imperative to give a sort of pep talk to persons being shorn of their illusions regarding free will, saying something to the effect that they cannot tell, in advance of trying, which self-restraints and/or self-improvements they will be capable of accomplishing... and so they should probably essay all things with completely undiminished fervor, irrespective of the fact that the results they will actually get... will have had to have been those results (and only those results).",4,0,1444713091,1444730665

There's a hugely significant difference between the scenario of paying child support, and of carrying a fetus within one's body.

Ignoring that difference, and saying every woman must incubate every pregnancy (because every sire is liable for the support of children directly descendant of his seed) is kinda like comparing apples and oranges.",1,0,1444706097,1444730665

As far as legal economic responsibilities related to a child's well-being are concerned... BOTH males and females have the option of nixing involvement with such support by not having sex in the first place. It's only that a female gets ONE EXTRA chance to nix a birth than the male does, EXACTLY because it is she, and only she, that must house the fetus for 9 months if it is to be born... the male never does this visceral housing, and so may only rightly 100% nix a birth by either a) selecting to not participate in those activities which risk it, or b) getting sterilized, whether by vasectomy or RISUG/Vasalgel.

What I am saying is that the analogy of comparing forced incubation to enforcing child support payments is an extremely poor one.",1,0,1444706001,1444730665
cvxqn48,0,t1_cvx7p97,Kirkayak,"I would say that personhood might include a number of elements, including:

* having arrived at a developmental stage wherein a capacity to feel pain (not reflex, pain) is physiologically possible (or having had such a capacity, at one time)

* having arrived at a developmental stage wherein a capacity for rudimentary cognition is physiologically possible (or having had such a capacity, at one time)

* capable of living outside of the visceral innards of another person

I am not sure that I can argue for each of these, but they seem very much akin to the sorts of things we should be looking at.

What is certain is that a 4 month old fetus is not the same thing as a born infant, and calling such a fetus a baby smacks of blatant propaganda.
