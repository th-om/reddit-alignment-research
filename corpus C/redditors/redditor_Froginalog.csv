Almost across the board shooters are male. That's the most salient point.

cvqvjmn,0,t1_cvkdpvl,Froginalog,"95% of romantic relationships may not work out either. That's why it's called dating. Doesn't prove that finding a partner, when it does work, isn't really important for people's happiness.

Psychoanalysis is, in the end, about a type of powerful relationship. Expecting it to work on ""method"" alone is silly.

Now, I'll fully admit that many analysts are greedy and will keep seeing patients as long as they're willing to keep paying, even when the analyst knows their particular dynamic just isn't doing anything for the patient.

But then, there are people who hang on in relationships even when they know they're not working too...",1,0,1444185989,1444731406
cvne01g,1,t3_3nbf4n,Froginalog,"To me the most salient common denominator in most of these cases are that the crazies are all male.

We should seriously stop and consider what that means.

Are guns less available to women? No. But women just don't do this shit. Why?

The conversation we need to be having isn't about gun control its about the construction of American Masculinity, maybe even specifically white American masculinity (at least when it comes to rampage type shootings), how it trains boys, what sort of boys it alienates or disenfranchises, what images they are haunted with, what symbolic pressures they are put under.

All the feminism and sexual liberation hasn't stopped these. They're getting worse almost in tandem with increasing PC culture and increased individualism and increased flexibility in gender scripts.

And this has its victims too (every values regime does). A certain type of (predominantly white male) subjectivity is in crisis. Not the ""alphas"" so much (whose own personal charisma and confidence carry them through either way) but these so-called ""betas"" who have been left with NO identity, no grounding in any sort of communal purpose.

Minorities and women can embrace victimary thinking. But the white male subject has been ""emptied of content"" or placed purely in an oppositional role as oppressor (you aren't allowed to have ""white pride"" for example, and talk of ""men's rights"" is looked at suspiciously).

Some men of course navigate this just fine and find their confidence and pride in other ways, because they have the strength of personality to compete in the game of individualism.

But we've created a new type of subject, a ""castrated"" subject (to use the symbolism of psychoanalysis)...and this violent aggression we see is to be expected from such disaffected disenfranchised disembedded subjects. Society as a whole has created a nihilistic void that they incarnate.

All I can say is I'm glad I'm gay...",-3,0,1443925595,1444731406

cvk6jbf,1,t3_3n0dej,Froginalog,"Nonsense. Psychoanalysis is an art. Trying to apply science to it is like trying to apply science to predict elections. You can study and study what makes someone charismatic or attractive, for example, but all that data isn't terribly useful in practice.

The effectiveness of something like psychoanalysis is extremely individual because it's all about a transference dynamic being established between the analyst and patient. Some analysts (or whatever type of therapist) are better at eliciting this than others because they just have that je ne sais quoi, and some patients are more receptive than others, and in some cases it's a question not of one or the other but merely of the match/combination.

Human beings aren't machines. Even if it ""fails"" to treat issues in 95% of cases, this proves nothing. It may be extremely effective (the only real treatment for personality disorders, at least, in my opinion...and most mental illness short of schizophrenia or bipolar is really from a personality disorder if you ask me) in the 5% of cases where the kismet actually happens, but like say seeking out a romantic partner there may just be no real way to guarantee such patient-analyst chemistry will occur except by trial and error and many failed pairings.

Sure, you can collect some general data ala match.com to make more favorable probabilities. But in the end you're talking about a transformative relationship. You can't ""science"" that. The medicalization of psychology has been an unmitigated disaster and represents an area in which our empiricism-obsession has taken us huge steps backward in terms of real understanding.",-7,0,1443673636,1444731406
cvc3qg3,0,t1_cvbvwy4,Froginalog,"It's a sad fact, that I don't know how to get around, that it is very hard to break-up a social *network* that is causing problems without actually destroying the people who make up that network.

How do you destroy a problematic CLASS without destroying the humans making up that class?

Unfortunately, it is much more feasible to destroy bodies than to destroy relationships and loyalties and interpersonal *structures* while the bodies still live. You can know a body is dead. You can never really know that a class-loyalty is dead in a heart that still beats.

The most evil sort of power is the power so diffuse that it is impossible to identify a rational target in fighting it. They say a hydra is bad because if you cut off its head, three more grow. But at least it has a head. A certain type of evil in the world is more like a slime-mold, no head at all...

It's the same problem with US imperialism. People blame the jihadists for attacking ""innocents""...but, seriously, how else do you fight a faceless impersonal behemoth of a system except to attack the people who are its citizens and beneficiaries and hope it undermines the whole vast diffuse power structure?",13,0,1443059631,1444731406
