cvwt3ru,1,t3_3oeppe,jmj1970,"There is no conflict between the Bible and modern science. As the foundation of all science is the notion that whatever someone is claiming that claim might be wrong. In those places where science claims to disprove something in the bible, we know that the bible cannot be wrong, so it must be the science that is wrong. Fortunately, science provides both the means and the methods to determine where it has gone wrong and make the necessary corrections given enough time and effort and desire. What I have always found interesting is that Christianity brought into being the very concept of the modern University and that many of history's greatest scientists have been devout Christians and continue to be today.

I would suggest reading the following document:

I would suggest these issues, etc. podcast segments:

cvw6z91,1,t3_3od9bj,jmj1970,"What is being referred to is some of the odder laws in Liv and other places in the OT. The law in Scripture can be put into one of three bins:

1. The ceremonial law. This law was brought to completion with the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

2. The civil Law. The law that applied only to the Nation of Israel. The Nation of Israel ceased a long time ago.

3. The moral law. This covers things like the 10 Commandments. This law still applies.

The laws being mentioned and other ""gotcha"" laws which might have been mentioned fall into one of the first two bins and no longer apply to us today.

You can see examples of this throughout scripture. Acts 10:9-16 deal with the dietary laws. Acts 15 and Gal 2 provides an example concerning circumcision. Luther handles the topic in his discussion of the [3rd Commandment](http://bookofconcord.org/lc-3-tencommandments.php#para78) in his large catechism. 

For further details, I would suggest starting with this short article:

[mosaic law](http://www.worldvieweverlasting.com/tag/mosaic-law/)

Worldview Everlasting is run by a respected Lutheran Pastor. The actual post was likewise written by another. Both are brilliant men well versed in this topic. Of course, the post simply repeats what one of the most brilliant theologians in the modern era, Martin Luther, had to say on the topic...and, of course, he is just repeating the apostolic faith as passed down through the generations. All of it is based solely on scripture.

For a humorous take on this, you can check out the brilliant The Lutheran Satire 6 minute video:
