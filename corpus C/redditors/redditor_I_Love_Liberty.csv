How useful, really? I don't think common criminals prior to the year 1200 were very badly inconvenienced by the fact that guns didn't exist. It certainly takes a lot of the guesswork out of picking victims if the most the victim can be packing is a knife.",3,0,1444271854,1444718944

cvra1lb,0,t1_cvr3h2v,I_Love_Liberty,"You are clearly not reading my comments.

I don't claim the USA has a better 'handle' on gun control and gun violence or any type of violent crime for that matter. Violent crime is a complicated phenomenon with many, many causes. It does not boil down to simply whether there are guns around.

>Why doesn't Australia and the UK not have mass school shootings?

Same reason why innocent people there can't defend themselves effectively against the violent crime that occurs there. There are no guns around.

>Edit: you know though, forgive me for suggesitn things that work overseas. The situation is fine. The fact that these shootings occur DAILY is fine. The US is the ONLY country in the western world where this happens, and you are right. NOTHING can be done to prevent this, this is like a tornado, like the wind. Mass shootings are totally unpreventable. Enjoy

I don't claim mass shootings are unpreventable. If you'd bothered to read my comments (I know, it's hard to actually read and comprehend things that challenge your world view. If you're not up to it, that's fine) you'd notice that I said the measures which reduce mass shootings do more harm overall by taking guns out of the hands of good people that would only use them to defend against crime. Mass shootings have claimed the live of hundreds of people over the past few decades. Meanwhile people use guns to defend against violent crime hundreds of thousands of times per year. The world is not a perfect place. There is a trade-off to every choice. In the case of guns, the benefit you'd get by lowering the already very low rate of mass shootings is not worth the reduction in the ability of the average person to defend against violent crime.",1,0,1444227733,1444718944
cvr9t2k,0,t1_cvr03ol,I_Love_Liberty,">As I read their recommendations, yes, it should not be loaded unless you intend to fire it.

That's not what I get out of reading their rules, and that's not what I got out of taking an NRA gun safety course. What rules are you reading?

>Because you think it's responsible to carry loaded weapons on your person.

cvqsxrz,0,t1_cvqqwf9,I_Love_Liberty,">I don't really want to be rude here - but sources? I am an Australia.

I'm having trouble finding the article where I saw the data. I'll keep looking.

>Without any statistics, I don't think we have a problem with violent crime.

You likely don't have as serious a problem as the US, but violent crime is a very complicated issue and there are quite a lot of factors that influence it.

>If you gave me the choice between America's Freedom Gun Laws and Australia's level of crime, it's a no brainer.

What you want is the lower level of crime. I think it's very mistaken to believe that if the US and Australia swapped gun policies, there would be more crime in Australia and less in the US.

>There was a video going around of a guy with a knife being subdued by two UK police officers. Most of the comments were ""dude would be dead in the US"" UK Police don't carry guns. They had other ways to deal with the situation. 

I don't know what video you're referring to, but it's important to keep in mind that you're always balancing risk against reward. The cops may have subdued him successfully without being hurt this time, but they are taking on quite a lot of personal risk. Knives are incredibly dangerous. I'm not going to defend police actions in the US because I think the legal system protects them far too much and they know it.

>Home Invasion point of view - would pepper spray and tasers not be an alternative?

Yes, and throwing a shoe at the invaders is an alternative too. The question is how likely any given alternative is to work and how expensive the alternative is. The best alternative is to have armed guards. They'll keep you safe against almost any non-state threat. But that's really expensive. Guns will result in you prevailing in a lot of cases than pepper spray and tasers won't, and they're inexpensive so many people can afford them.

>If firearms on the black market cost the same in the US as it did in Australia, fewer criminals would have them.

Right, but:

>> Violent criminals have been victimizing people since the dawn of man. Guns are not exactly a crucial tool of their trade. If neither they nor their victims can have guns, I'd guess they actually have an easier time because they get to pick who they attack and don't have to worry about an easy-looking mark surprising them. The exception to this rule is probably mass shootings, where guns really do seem to be the easiest and most effective way to kill enough people to get yourself in the news. But mass shootings are incredibly, incredibly rare compared to defensive gun uses.",1,0,1444181383,1444718944
cvqsa6a,0,t1_cvqrspb,I_Love_Liberty,">As I said, I am not willing to debate that point. Especially with someone who calls 60,000 ""hundreds of thousands.""

I don't call 60,000 ""hundreds of thousands"". I specifically stated that number is guaranteed to far underestimate the true number due to the way it was arrived at.

>As to your latter point, even the NRA agrees that guns should be stored unloaded and securely locked away.

That's a fine recommendation for what to do when storing the gun. Does the NRA believe guns should be stored at all times?

>but because you simply cannot be trusted with it.

Why do you believe that?",1,0,1444180255,1444718944
cvqragt,0,t1_cvqqv44,I_Love_Liberty,">As I said, I have no interest in debating that point. It's easy enough for you to find if you want. My experience tells me that it's a waste of time to wrestle with people who deny the consensus view.

Estimates go from 60,000/year according to anti-gun groups who use sources that are guaranteed to hugely underestimate the number to several million per year according to pro-gun groups who use sources that will overestimate the number. It's a very difficult number to estimate, and as far as I know there is no better consensus than somewhere in the hundreds of thousands.

>They are anyway.

No, they certainly are not if they have a gun available.

>Unless you keep that gun loaded and at hand at all times, it's impossible to use it defensively. 

This is just stupid. There are situations in which the potential victim will have time to load the gun, there are situations in which the potential victim will have time to draw a loaded gun from concealment or from somewhere close by, there are situations where only having the gun in hand will help, and there are situations where even having the gun in hand won't be good enough. Most people who have guns for self-defense keep them loaded but either concealed or close by, and they successfully use them from that state hundreds of thousands of times each year.",1,0,1444178540,1444718944
cvqqa64,0,t1_cvqodk4,I_Love_Liberty,">You are overstating it by many, many orders of magnitude. Legitimate instances of self defence with a gun are vanishingly rare.

You have better information than the peer-reviewed research on the subject? Even anti-gun groups which use data sources specifically designed to hugely underestimate the number put it at over 60,000/year.

>Offensive use of guns is, of course, the usual outcome.

Perhaps, but in most cases, criminals would be better off if no one had guns. Criminals pick their victims, not the other way around. They have the opportunity to pick a weaker target, and there is no shortage of weaker targets. The victims of crime wouldn't be a whole lot better off if violent criminals stopped using guns and went back to the weapons they used prior to the invention of the gun. The big difference is that physically weak would be completely vulnerable. Not a great outcome.",1,0,1444176830,1444718944

cvqlzzh,0,t1_cvqlkib,I_Love_Liberty,">No, they do not, because you are more likely to harm yourself or another with a ""defensive"" gun than you are to prevent harm.

The likelihood of harming yourself or someone else with a gun varies greatly from person to person. A non-violent non-suicidal person who takes great care to follow the rules of gun safety is not more likely to harm himself or an innocent person with a defensive gun than he is to prevent harm. It's up to each person to make sure he and those around him are responsible. It's not so much up to each person to decide if he will be randomly attacked by a violent criminal. That's up to the criminal.

Do people who are very careful with their guns and extremely unlikely to intentionally harm innocents not have a legitimate reason for owning a gun?",2,0,1444169396,1444718944
