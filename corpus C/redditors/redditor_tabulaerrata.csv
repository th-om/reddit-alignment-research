""Both the monument and the exhibit would be financed with park revenue â€” chiefly parking and entrance fees. No appropriation from the state Legislature would be required. Full funding sources, project scope and budget are yet to be determined. The park is operated by Silver Dollar City-Stone Mountain Park, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Georgia firm Herschend Family Entertainment.""",12,0,1444667688,1444727383

cvrfeax,0,t1_cvre0st,tabulaerrata,"No need to apologize! I simply meant that others in this specific post/thread had already given some great advice, so mine would be of marginal additional benefit. 

I hope you figure something out to avoid co-signing! Too many cons, too few pros.",2,0,1444235959,1444727383
cvqk7l7,1,t3_3nr4sr,tabulaerrata,"This has already been answered half a dozen times in this thread, so listen to these guys advice. With that, my short answer is *DO NOT CO-SIGN*. If you truly feel or believe that you need to help them out of this hole, decide whether you can help them bridge their payments *for a specific amount of time* (i.e. 6 months, a year, whatever), then do so -- I would suggest helping with the gap in what they can pay vs. the mortgage bill(s), but no more. Set their expectations, then *manage* their expectations. This isn't that easy when these are your own parents... But you need to avoid putting your credit scores/history/etc. on the line, messing up your own first-time homebuyer's benefit, and -- most importantly, IMO -- starting out on the right foot for yourself and any S.O. with your debts & expenses, emergency fund, retirement planning, and any other savings you expect to need (for travel, for eventual homebuying, for ""having a life"" as a still somewhat recent graduate, etc.).

I don't envy you this situation. Best of luck in resolving it happily with your parents. Don't give in to pressure or guilt trips! They need to straighten this out, whether it's selling the home for something financially feasible or otherwise.",2,0,1444166564,1444727383
