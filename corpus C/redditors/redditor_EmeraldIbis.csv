cvvqur0,0,t1_cvvqdrf,EmeraldIbis,"It's a well known fact that the free market is the most efficient form of economy. Restrictions on freedom of movement restrict the free market. Therefore, restrictions on freedom of movement reduce economic efficiency. That's basically the entirety of my argument.

Yeah, in the short term the wealthier countries will probably face a decline in wealth as wealth distribution equalises across the union. So what? If we're so concerned about our own short-term pleasure that we're unable to maximise efficiency and therefore maximise future growth then we totally deserve the inevitable decline in wealth relative to the rest of the world.

China has a population larger than the entire European Union. Do you think it would be good for the economy of Chengdu province if they split away from the others? Do you think the economy of Ohio would be better off if it left the United States? I highly doubt you do. So why do you think the economy of the United Kingdom would be better off if it left the European Union?

On a related note, if you're a UKIP supporter, I assume you opposed Scottish independence last year? Do you not realise that both cases are the exact same argument? Its massively hypocritical to take opposite arguments on each.",1,0,1444567174,1444719901
cvvptjs,0,t1_cvvpm7v,EmeraldIbis,"Yes, that does constitute nationalism. The idea that larger economic units are more efficient than smaller ones is a pretty basic economic principle. Its best for the European economy as a whole to have freedom of movement for goods, capital, services, and people throughout the union. Any yet people still argue against it on the basis that it may be worse for the British economy in the short term. You're putting our short-term needs as British citizens above our long-term needs as European citizens, even though it reduces overall economic efficiency. In other words, you're putting your emotional attachment to the United Kingdom above the cold, hard numbers.",1,0,1444563220,1444719901
cvvozb3,0,t1_cvvonvg,EmeraldIbis,"Most I have seen recently have been around 53/47. So yeah, pretty close.

There seems to be a lot of variation over time though. Up until the beginning of 2014 virtually every poll said 'exit', often by relatively large margins. Then 2014 was pretty mixed, and 2015 has been consistantly 'stay' up until the last few weeks when it's started to be pretty mixed again... Who knows what the odds will be by 2017.

I think one of the biggest questions is what the turnout will be though. The higher the turnout, the more likely the result will be to stay, because there is a very clear age-divide when it comes to this issue and older people tend to vote more readily than younger people.",0,0,1444559453,1444719901

In a truly free market, houses would have been built until the price came down to just slightly above the building costs. I'm OK with imposing some restrictions, but we clearly went way, way too far.",-2,0,1444507707,1444719901
