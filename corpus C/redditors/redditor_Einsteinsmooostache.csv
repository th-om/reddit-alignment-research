cvtmb43,0,t1_cvt36r1,Einsteinsmooostache,"This is false. Your formulas are correct, but overall the wrong analysis (unless his friend botched the hell out of the circuit design). 

Humbuckers have higher resistance than single coils - usually on the scale of 10:7 kilohms - and have much higher output. Lowering resistance typically thins the sound, think middle and bridge position on a strat. Independently they hover around 7 kilohms but in parallel they drop to 3.5 ish, and with that you get the thin sounding quack of a strat.

cvtm0n4,1,t3_3o12pf,Einsteinsmooostache,"I would start by checking the wiring, most likely there's a weak connection somewhere. 

But to help you trouble shoot further, is it low output in all positions or just when both pickups are selected together? 

What the guy above said about resistance is only partly correct. The formulas he gave is right, but that doesn't mean it actually affects the price of tea in China. 

In your original wiring setup, when you move the pickup selector it acts as a switch that ignores the volume pot of the pickup you don't want anyway. So if wired properly (which may be another problem) the resistance wouldn't be increased enough to notice.

P.S. Get yourself a multimeter. Game changer for guitar mods ",2,0,1444394041,1444721479
cvsl8h7,0,t1_cvq762x,Einsteinsmooostache,"I believe it done was by measuring the shadow at the same time in different locations. Some story of a runner reporting the measurements to the scientist (though I can't recall who). 

Measuring at different times of day would give you rotational info but to extract circumference would take knowing distance away from the sun. Radians/degrees --> length requires a length measurement they wouldn't have had. ",1,0,1444319789,1444721479
cvry0ai,0,t1_cvrw3f5,Einsteinsmooostache,"Cool! More what I was hoping to hear. It's a classic I believe, but man I'd love a blues boy with the p90 and then add a middle pickup. That'd be the end right there. ",1,0,1444264339,1444721479
cvrtgy5,0,t1_cvrq58s,Einsteinsmooostache,"Yes indeed. When it comes down to it I think bargain hunting for guitars is largely a losing endeavor. Good ones are pricy for a reason.

cvrn8jb,0,t1_cvrhzb3,Einsteinsmooostache,"I understand the divide but to me this is like saying an experimental physicist doesn't understand physics because they don't live in theory. 

It's a different view no doubt but the international success trump has seen (by playing the game, not necessarily because of brilliant market speculation) requires a high level understanding. At least enough to recognize how he could exploit a free trade agreement. ",1,0,1444247289,1444721479

This is not an idiotic stance. The power vacuum created by al Assad's fall would almost certainly be filled by Isis - this giving them even more valuable land resources. ",5,0,1443630127,1444721479
