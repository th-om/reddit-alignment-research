cusde3e,0,t1_cus27cq,CaptainCoul,"Thanks for the information, and others said a similar thing about lowering influence of the general populous. So I made it so people can vote for the top tier politicians, like we have currently :)",1,0,1441536975,1444732300
cusddec,0,t1_cus2lj0,CaptainCoul,"just changed it so that the top tier is now publically elected again, like we have currently :)",1,0,1441536874,1444732300
cusd5bt,0,t1_cus6w7f,CaptainCoul,"In this system the average person at least has a shot of being better heard as they're more likely to have a better connection with those organising their district/county etc. And yes they lose the chance to pick a high tier politician, but some see the current situation as having to pick the best of a bad bunch and many don't pick at all. In this system You would be letting the man/woman (who you think is the wisest and best represents your view) pick the high tier politician for you. But I do understand what you are saying and so will change the system accordingly! I hadn't thought of what you said, and now agree that people should be allowed to directly elect the top teir representatives",1,0,1441535736,1444732300

curwu5f,0,t1_curwgba,CaptainCoul,"thanks, for the feedback, changed accordingly to a geographical based system rather than an ideological based system. Oh and the thing about pairs acting as representatives of the populous was partly inspired by the Roman democracy before the Emperors became a thing. They always had two heads of states, which yes seems ridiculous at first glance but apparently led to more balanced and wiser decision making. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul",1,0,1441491691,1444732300
