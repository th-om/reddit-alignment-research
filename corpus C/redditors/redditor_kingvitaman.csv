cvxv6qw,1,t3_3ojq52,kingvitaman,"I took hunter safety when I was around ten or eleven. I don't see why issues about guns shouldn't at the very least be talked about in schools. There's 300 million of them in the US, and kids will most likely come into contact with them. I got my first gun at 5 ( .22 single shot) and respected guns a lot more than my friends whose parents kept them locked up and out of reach. I know it sounds ridiculous, but demystifying guns, and teaching how important it is not to fuck around with them is better than acting like they don't exist ( in the home and outside ) .  My family were really anti bb gun because they thought it taught kids not to take guns seriously and fuck around with them. Also, believe it or not, no realistic toy guns.

She'll be so careful and rehearsed it will be hard not to sound canned. And she's not a very good actor. She hasn't given many interviews or speeches, and I think people will quickly remember how boring she is once she starts speaking.  She's also unbelievably awful off the cuff. Check out her most recent speaking engagement, ignore the silliness of the standing and clapping, but look at how she handles it. [link](http://youtu.be/cqrSJi0aYZA)

cvxc380,0,t1_cvxbkam,kingvitaman,"Still probably not good policy for a store to lock in thieves. Never seems to end well, and I'm guessing it's not entirely legal. It also supposes that the salon in this case has good evidence to prove she didn't pay. On top of that, there's obvious language differences. She could just say she called her boyfriend to come pay and they didn't understand or something. But the whole kidnapping, or false  imprisonment charges. Those are a bit more serious than petit theft. Again, I think it sucks, I'd like to see her fight a pack of pitbulls, but a business really opens themselves up to lawsuits by locking people in. And this woman could definitely be on a settlement hunt. ",3,0,1444682417,1444717850
