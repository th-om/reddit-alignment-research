cvxr6tm,0,t1_cvwwlg3,watchmeplay63,"This is actually one of my favorite examples, because while the wages look low compared to the western world, they're actually very prestigious jobs for a lot of the workers in China. Coming from someone with a lot of first hand business and personal experience with several Asian economies, I can tell you for a fact that these factory jobs are significantly better both in lifestyle and pay than their next best alternative. Is that a good thing overall? There's certainly room for debate. But it certainly isn't nearly as bad as its made out to be. There's a reason people literally fight for these jobs.",1,1,1444705977,1444725086

cvus3vv,0,t1_cvunr0t,watchmeplay63,"Why would you want an equality of speech? You realize that would quite literally mean that the KKK would be required to have the same amount of ""speech"" as the Democratic party?
