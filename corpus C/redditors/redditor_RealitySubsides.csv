cvxt9ws,0,t1_cvxt24x,RealitySubsides,"It's fine, I'm happy to help. Show her you care, blow up her phone. Honestly, get her to talk to you, get her to tell you how she feels. 

I'm really worried about her. I sincerely hope this all works out, I hope she comes around and starts talking to you. ",1,0,1444709773,1444726740
cvxsms7,1,t3_3ojbxm,RealitySubsides,"I would say that blocking her completely and removing yourself from her life is the exact wrong approach, she's going to panic and think she did something wrong. I'd suggest that if you aren't ready for a relationship, tell her. Be friends with her, be there for her. When you're going through serious depression like she is, having someone to talk to is an enormous help. It gives you a way to get the feelings out other than taking it out on yourself. That may be why she grew attached so quickly, she's just craving someone who wants to be there for her.

If you don't want to be there for her, you don't have to. If that's why you blocked her, that's fine, it's understandable. I just don't want you to think that it's in any way making things better for her. I'd honestly just recommend you keep talking to her, say you panicked because you realized that you weren't ready for anything more than friendship, and then be there for her. That's assuming that you do want to continue talking to her, but are worried that by doing so you're only going to make her more into you, which will hurt her in the end since you aren't interested. I don't know what her depression is based around, but I do know that having someone helps hugely, even if they aren't interested.

I've been on both sides of serious depression (first my own, then my girlfriend's) so I may be being slightly biased. All I know is that it helps to have someone who cares and who is there to listen, even if they're just a friend. ",2,0,1444708498,1444726740

cvsx26x,0,t1_cvsnpzw,RealitySubsides,"I wholeheartedly agree. I think that if Sanders won the nomination, it wouldn't take long before socialist stopped being used against him. Once he starts debating and getting his policies out there, more and more people are going to find that they agree with him.",1,0,1444336947,1444726740
cvs1siv,0,t1_cvricdp,RealitySubsides,"I mean the point does have some merit. The word ""socialist"" has such a negative stigma around it, people equate it with evil for some reason. That's why they went after Obama for being a socialist. It's become derogatory. Sanders is going to get blasted with attack ads about it.",1,0,1444270526,1444726740
cvs1nr8,1,t3_3nv9ku,RealitySubsides,"I'm currently a Sophomore in college. I go to an art school, so this might not apply, but all that shit they're saying is nonsense. It's dramatically different in college. First, you choose your classes. I don't know how many gen eds you're going to need to do your first semester, but since you've gotten A's in school I'll assume you did AP or some equivalent. When you choose your classes, you don't hate them. I've hated very few of my classes and because of this, I've done better in them than I ever did in high school. Depending on your field, that may not apply (I'm a film major).

The major difference between high school and college is that you're completely on your own. That means you're going to have to be good at making yourself do the work when there's so much more fun things you could be doing. If you do the homework and read what you need to read, the classes won't be any harder than high school. I've found that they're actually infinitely easier, because I generally only have one 3-to-4 hour class a day.

High school fucking sucks. I'm so glad I never have to go back.",2,0,1444270312,1444726740
