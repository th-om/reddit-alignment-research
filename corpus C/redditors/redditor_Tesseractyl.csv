cvueo1u,0,t1_cvtppc3,Tesseractyl,"Free will and the self are illusions because they impose frameworks on reality that are essentially arbitrary. But any conception we can have of reality as interconnected and deterministic will also be more or less arbitrary. What is the measure of accuracy for such high-level concepts when so many of the issues seem to be a matter of the perspective one assumes? One cannot appeal to an ultimate interpretation of reality because every interpretation is a reflection of the individual circumstances and characteristics of the one who conceives it. To say that free will and the self do not exist may in some senses be correct. However, for the purposes of living life as it presents itself to us immediately, without abstracting about it intellectually, it seems as though these things are extremely relevant concepts for managing our lives, behaving appropriately in social contexts, and understanding the behavior of others. That is to say, it may be true that self and free will are not universals with ontological grounding, but it very much seems to most people that these terms and ideas capture something critical and important about their identities and their approach to living life. Do you reject all of these perspectives as invalid and insist that yours, that of selflessness and determinism, is demonstrably more accurate a description of the world and its state of affairs? That seems to me a terribly strong claim for someone so far out in these weeds. Both of these sets of perspectives have merits, both can help us to see the world in new and important ways, but neither has any claim to being more true.",1,0,1444442206,1444731386

cuvjl1t,1,t3_3k6avz,Tesseractyl,"Crying foul about people disrespecting the Constitution and the Supreme Court is a little hypocritical if you can conceive of a scenario in which you would conscientiously disobey the law. If slavery were made legal again, I'm certain there would be a huge number of people resisting and deliberately violating that law, and none of us would say that's a constitutional crisis threatening to bring down American society; we would say that's ""real America"" reacting to the insensitivity of our government and re-asserting our own values. Whether or not it's acceptable for people to refuse to respect and obey the government's laws seems to be a settled issue for most folks: it's acceptable as long as you have a good moral or ethical justification. The proper angle of attack with Davis is to point out that her justification is terrible. Construed properly, she is a pivotal figure in a system constructed in part to deny homosexuals their full rights, and to participate in that oppression while citing conscientious objection is doubly abhorrent in precisely the same fashion as racist segregationists quoting bible verses and waving American flags in the name of saving America from the darkies. Conscientious objection is a well-established form of political protest and most people don't challenge that notion. What remains is to point out that her objection is itself the injustice.",6,0,1441804907,1444731386
cutgoto,1,t3_3jz304,Tesseractyl,"What class is it that's asking you to make this classification? Not to be mean, but this seems like an arbitrary framework that you're being asked to shoehorn things into. I find it difficult to believe that modern historians still try to bin eras neatly this way. Coming up with a theoretical framework to fit periods into is fun, but it doesn't actually tell us anything about history, it just gives us that satisfied feeling when we think we've got everything filed away in a tidy fashion. Human affairs are not tidy now and never have been. Every period has elements of chaos, balance, and adjustment, and if you begin your analysis determined to fit into those categories, you'll just emphasize some elements and de-emphasize others until it seems to work. It's the same methodological error that leads people to get really into astrology.

Not to be mean a second time, but would you happen to be Chinese? This reeks of their cyclical model of politics, which honestly should be taught only in historiography, not history. Regardless, if you've got a teacher foisting this on you, I certainly hope their angle is that it's a fun, lighthearted prompt to provoke an investigatory paper, because if they're selling this as dogma then they're just a teeny bit of a crackpot; and even if they're not it's a framework so irritatingly simplistic it rather sucks as a prompt too. Write a paper about that and see where it gets you, eh?",1,0,1441637136,1444731386
