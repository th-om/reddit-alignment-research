cvxij5p,1,t3_3og970,soyunamariposa,"I spent years doing immigrant visa interviews (so my job was to say yes, yes but for, or no.). Thus I've experienced telling people yes (always fun & happy), yes but for (waiver app, time, money), yes but for (try again in 10, 20 years), no, and on occasion asked my employer (State Dept) to revoke a sponsors US passport because it had been obtained fraudulently, i.e. that person had a fake US birth certificate and used it to get a US passport etc.

I had several unpleasant exchanges in this sub with attorneys (when they would say ""do X and you'll be fine"" without knowing the poster's home country or entry/exit history/criminal history etc) whose expertise, such as it was, was on adjusting status within the US, or they worked solely with one ethnicity from one world region/country. Thus they saw my warnings, advice and comments as ludicrous and wrong because they were completely unwitting to the fact that different populations have very different profiles (meaning they were affected by sections of the law in ways these attorney's had never seen and didn't know to look out for/advise their clients on). One even was enraged at me and said I was an idiot because there was no such thing as falsified birth certificates and the US government couldn't revoke US passports.

Because of that experience, I rarely post in threads and just PM OPs when the think I've got info for them that might help.

My experience here mirrored my experience working with applicants. Some had been given excellent advice, while others had been taken for a ride and were now in deep doo doo in terms of ever actually immigrating.

So imho, while the process at any point from immigrating to naturalization is technically transparent and an applicant shouldn't ever need help, in reality it's complicated and easy to misunderstand. And that complication grows for every ""issue"" they might have.  An attorney who knows well about immigrating etc from *your* country can help more than one whose client base is from a different country. For example, if a person is immigrating from Mexico, an attorney who works mostly with clients from India will be clueless about the difference in pitfalls, interview questions asked etc. even as they know the process well, and thus won't be able to guide an applicant as well.",5,0,1444692349,1444729148
cvvfb4e,1,t3_3o7hai,soyunamariposa,"Didn't date in high school. Rarely dated in college. A virgin into my 20s. Rarely dated in my 20s, married for the first time at 35. Divorced after a decade of marriage to a sociopathic con-artist who damned near killed me at age 45 with no children. Remarried to the man of my dreams at 47 (equally child free) and *blissfully* happy.

When you date, kids/no kids, how old you were when X milestone happened? These things are just things. They don't prevent you from connecting with others, from finding love, from achieving a life you want.

But if someone says they are? Then kick them and their ugly judgment to the curb. That way you won't waste your time on them and thus they won't be a barrier to having your life be the way you want.",2,0,1444531016,1444729148

When you cry from frustration during a negotiation, that ***is*** giving away your power because your opponent now knows you're on the ropes.

When you cry from the sheer depth of emotion and empathy for a situation or issue that matters incredibly to you?  That will play positively on the emotions of the listener whether or not they agree with you.  In those scenarios, they won't see the tears as weak, they will see them as passion.  They will see you as human.

cvuv2rw,1,t3_3o4mt8,soyunamariposa,"There are two fictional male characters I adore, Lord Peter Wimsey and Jamie Fraser.  Both are concepted by female authors, both are establishment yet also intelligent and open to questioning.  And both make room in their lives for a female outsider.

I agree that Jamie was positively influenced in his ability to grow past the confines of his time by Claire.  But I think he also was open to it not just due to his innate intelligence, but because he too was an outsider in his own time.  He was part of the establishment, but yet not due to his black sheep status within MacKenzie clan.  That made him able to ""see"" Claire in a way that the Colum's and Dougal's could not.

Jamie gets explored and fleshed out much much more than Lord Peter Wimsey ever did.  And he is so flawed. He has so many not positive aspects that Claire lovingly dodges in service of saving him from himself.  That core though. Honor and openess.  That core is awesome.  We should all be so lucky to have it and to find it in another.",4,0,1444493336,1444729148

cvtrmgv,1,t3_3o39zi,soyunamariposa,"I became interested in AB via a Chizu Saeki skincare book and hearing about Hada Labo products as an extension of that.

This sub has helped me expand my knowledge about AB products, where to buy them, and how to use them together.  That's the main reason I'm here.

I'll confess too to an AB super-kawaii bias that's probably a little too intense given I'm likely too old to still fall victim to packaging but oh well, there are worse vices in life :) and this sub supports me in that which I like. So a second reason I'm here.

The third reason? The discussion about product ingredients and their uses. That's been a godsend! This discussion helps me choose what products to buy, and a happy side effect is when I'm considering western products, I can evaluate them by ingredients (and hence helps me avoid a lot of worthless products that promise effects that I now know their ingredient lists can't achieve).

I'd hate to see this sub expand beyond that.  AB is a sub I rarely post in, but I read voraciously. AB companies seem to be constantly releasing new products and without this sub to help me understand them, track down and translate ingredient lists, and discuss just what does this new ingredient does, and then people posting about their experiences with it, I'd be a bit lost.",2,0,1444404266,1444729148

cvssla9,0,t1_cvsmv2r,soyunamariposa,"You are absolutely correct. A visa to enter the US is issued by the US State Department. A valid visa *only* gives you the right to go to a US port of entry and ask CBP/DHS to let you in. At that point the ball is entirely in CBPs court and they can either allow or deny you entry, regardless of your valid visa and past travel history.

The entry with a birth certificate thing is really about AMCITs can enter via land ports of entry with just a US birth certificate because AMCITs have the right of return. That said, if CBP thinks anything about you is off, you're going to be hanging out with them a good long while before they let you in, so it's an ill-advised thing to do.

A third country national who is merely a resident of Canada or Mexico has to have a passport and a visa to go to a port of entry and request to enter. That CBP official was actually being nice when all he did was turn this family around, & it was likely done because it was the baby who was missing documents. ",2,0,1444330481,1444729148
cvr30x8,1,t3_3nso9n,soyunamariposa,"American exceptionalism is a term that is referring to the fact that the US was the first country that figured out how to implement democracy and have it last generation after generation, thereby becoming the world's oldest surviving democratic form of government. 

This is because its founders were able to create representational democracy. Heretofore only direct democracy had been tried and direct democracy had been shown to only work in small populations. Representational democracy allows for large populations spread out over great geographic distances.

So ""exceptional"" is referring to how very special it is that the US created a form of government that really is for and by the people AND is stable and lasting.

All of this other rah rah we're great stuff is a misunderstanding about what the term means.  

Because conservatives - who, among other things, believe in honoring the past and not changing what came before (in government terms) - started using this term as part of the ""why"" of conservatism, liberal opponents seized on the term and either willfully or without understanding what was meant, began to react to it as if it meant all the rah rah b.s.

I suspect it happened when somehow the idea took hold that you could install democracy in societies that hadn't known it (eg Iraq).  Scholars knew this to be a fallacy (read Douglass North's work on institutional development) but conservative politicians overlooked that in service of promoting a military act that celebrated other goals (US domination in the ME and forestalling Soviet influence) so as politicians and scholars who fell victim to having influence in politics began to lose sight of how politically ""you can't get there from here aka path dependency aka network effects""  and they tossed around the term as if it meant America was exceptional/great/everyone should want to be it/claim the moral high ground and the original meaning (stable, lasting democracy) was lost. 

It's too bad because championing the original meaning is a way to recognize that democracy has to be honored, protected and husbanded lest it's lost to tyranny. That is Americans need to remember how special their form of government is, and by not knowing about our political past, are prone to making short sighted changes that damage it.

I'm all for the original, true meaning. The way it's gotten lost since 9/11 and mis-used for one party to seek to avenge old wounds (US actions in Iraq) and thereby become a point of attack by liberals of conservatives is a shame given that both misuses threaten the foundations of democracy in the very way the term is meant to combat.",7,0,1444206579,1444729148
cvoijg3,1,t3_3lo664,soyunamariposa,"The Good Wife is a comment on how wives of politicians get trapped into ""standing by their man"" when it's discovered he can't keep his dick in his pants. Since the show turns on Alicia doing that (even now, no divorce to hurt Peter), the title is perfect.

But since the show explores Alicia and you learn she's a real human with flaws and will act in her self-interest, the title falls flat.

Anyone watching the show as it aired since season one gets this, but I'm sure that the title probably does not incentivize new viewers.
