Is it the location in Aurora?  Is it salary & how much?  You make it sound like it's a revolving door?",1,0,1444698315,1444726676

In a normal sense, it would be nice if a politician filmed a two minute video everyday to upload it online for his/her constituents so that everyone could see what is going on.",5,0,1444696347,1444726676

(And to be fair, the US isn't fully capitalistic due to so much regulation).  Example...government monopolies of underground cables mean you get things monopolized cable providers like Comcast.  You can't buy land and just build a cheap dwelling to escape debt and collect rainwater etc. without the real land owners (government) telling you what you can do, or else they'll initiate force on you; you can't offer medical services without government licensing etc.",2,0,1444678037,1444726676

If there is evidence against anyone that cheated, stole, coerced, killed, etc. then by all means bring the evidence against them.  I think this is again saying what sounds good but doesn't have merit.  It sounds like you're implying the majority of rich people made more money than others because they cheated, etc.

>relied upon the public when he chose to claim bankruptcy.

He used the government's own game and created a corporation which is separate from himself.  This is actually against libertarianism, but in any case, sure, I guess he exploited the game of corporate bankruptcy law because he knew the government would be there to pay it.  This is what happens though when 99% of the voting population support this and then pretends to be mad when someone exploits it.

Perhaps random note but, if there is going to be a government with taxation, then I would persuade for a consumption tax rather than taxing production.",2,0,1444669450,1444726676

I guess I'd like you to spell it out on a smaller scale and say what you really mean.  I'm saying let's consider Donald Trump for the moment simply because we probably both know of him.

 In a libertarian society, you would defend yourself via war with those like you who do not believe in initiation of force.  However, only 1% of the population is libertarian according to the 2012 election, and so the minority of the population who doesn't believe in initiating violence, pays the local warlords off because it would be a losing battle to not do so.

Libertarian handles this issue by trying to educate others about the non-aggression principle.  Until ideas change, you have to pay off the mobsters to not have violence initiated against you.",1,0,1444622891,1444726676
