cvu2hbw,0,t1_cvu27cy,FlowCannon,My reality is fact-checked against historic events and adjusted accordingly.  Unfortunately the reality for you is based off emotions and feelings.  Do you honestly believe that the human race is naturally docile and governments won't oppress their citizens if left unchecked?  Open a goddamn history book and tell me what you see.,0,0,1444420515,1444717047

>On November 11, 1938, the Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons was promulgated by Minister of the Interior, Wilhelm Frick. This regulation effectively deprived all Jews living in those locations of the right to possess any form of weapons including truncheons, knives, or firearms and ammunition.[7]",9,0,1444420118,1444717047

Glad the prospect of reducing 10 million murders is worth a chuckle to you.  Do I need to link a video of Nazis lining up children against a wall and shooting them from 5 feet away?",3,0,1444419021,1444717047

Seriously?  I don't think many people here understand that Israel is a modern westernized country smack dab in the middle of an region with laws and a lifestyle straight from the 1200's. ",1,1,1444357984,1444717047

cvrg0kj,0,t1_cvrej6c,FlowCannon,"That's right.  I forgot he completely lacked the interpersonal skills to work with members of Congress.  So in a sense, his executive powers are used in isolation.",1,0,1444236870,1444717047
cvr9or6,0,t1_cvr8nne,FlowCannon,"Obama can introduce legislation to whatever the fuck issue he wants to prioritize.
