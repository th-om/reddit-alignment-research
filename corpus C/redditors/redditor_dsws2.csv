cviddxw,1,t3_3ms7zz,dsws2,"The price of solar and wind has been plummeting.  It started sky-high, so of course we haven't been using any appreciable amount of it.  From that he infers that we never will, because we can only double and two times zero is still zero.

Then he makes a big deal over the fact that the dates we associate with particular energy sources aren't the times when those sources provided most of the world's energy.  Well, of course they aren't.  History classes tell about the inventions.  They tell about scientific discoveries facilitated the development of new technologies, and vice versa.  They tell about when international politics was affected by the fact that some countries had adopted a technology and others hadn't.  By the time a technology is thoroughly adopted everywhere, it's a background factor.

Then he goes on about sunk costs.  Of course, he doesn't call them that, because the term ""sunk costs"" is part of the slogan ""sunk costs don't matter"".  If it gets to the point where it's cheaper to build wind and solar to replace a power plant than to keep mining coal to run it, then it's cheaper no matter whether the coal-burning plant cost ten million dollars to build or ten billion.

He claims that basic physics makes it impossible to have gigawatt-scale energy storage.  That's silly.  If basic physics lets you put energy into and out of storage at a rate of a kilowatt, it also lets you store and extract energy at a rate of a gigawatt.  Storage is expensive.  It's getting cheaper, but it's still going to be fairly expensive.  We'll use a lot of schedulable demand, excess capacity, and so on, because that will be cheaper than storage.  We'll burn fuel from time to time, for the foreseeable future, because storage is expensive.  The renewable-energy future was never planning to be absolutely 100% wind and solar.  But there's no law of fundamental physics that fixes the price of utility-scale energy storage.  If there were, it would never have varied in the past.

We're not in a dystopia, and we're not heading toward one.  Much of the world from 1914 to 1945 was a dystopia.  China experienced dystopia from 1958 to 1961.  Dystopia has existed in this century, in places such as Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The horrifyingly low life expectancies mentioned in the article are the result of famine wielded as a weapon of war.  The Holodomor was basically a success, so it has been emulated.

A life-expectancy gap of about five years is cause for concern.  We can and should do better.  But it's not dystopia.",1,0,1443547623,1444723040
cvi8lzx,0,t1_cvi5ucm,dsws2,"> How much would we expect taxes to go up?

That depends how much income everyone gets, and (if we're talking about tax rates rather than absolute amount) it depends on how big the tax base is.  If it's in the distant utopian future, we'll be so wealthy overall, and basic living expenses will be so cheap, that we'll be able to provide a basic income for everyone at tax rates below what we currently pay.  If it's implemented now, either the income would be too low to justify the expense of tracking everyone and making sure people don't try to get multiple basic incomes under different names, or the tax burden would be prohibitively high (given US politics).

>Why wouldn't prices just go up to adjust for the extra income everyone is getting 

Because it wouldn't be paid for by printing money.  The same amount of money would be buying the same amount of goods and services: we would just be spending less on single-family detached homes with a couple extra rooms, less on tiny roach-infested apartments, less on unique fruit jars from the 1800s (my brother collects them, and the really cool ones are definitely expensive), less on nice restaurant meals, less on top-tier cars, less on keeping junk cars running when it's no longer economical, and so on, in an amount that exactly offsets how we would be spending more on decent-but-not-great two-bedroom apartments, more on mid-tier restaurants, more on new economy cars, more on low-end entertainment, and so on.  Taking money from some people and giving it to other people doesn't change the overall level of spending.

>UBI would create a massive incentive for immigration. Should it also include a huge overhaul of boarder security to accommodate?

I don't think so.  Free trade lets people have more opportunity where they are.  It's a better option than border security.  If anything, I think we should spend less on border security, as well as internally on the massive police state that we have in the name of security.

>Would there be the long term effects on incentive to innovate if everyone knows they can just get by on the minimum?

Innovation happens when people can afford to take risks.  To start up a company in your garage, you have to be able to afford a garage in the first place.

>I assume UBI would be massively expensive. How can the national debt (already insanely high) support such a huge increase in spending?

The government is an insurance company with an army.  If we can enable people to make money by providing medical goods and services more cheaply than the other providers, rather than having the way to make money be by having your medical products be newer and more expensive, medical expenditures could fall by enough to cover a big chunk of the cost.  We could save a lot by incarcerating fewer people.  And we could spend a lot less on our military.  In the final analysis, though, it would have to be paid for with taxes.  Any cuts we contemplate, other than in services and transfer payments that UBI would directly replace, could be made without implementing UBI too, so a fair comparison has to present it as a trade-off where taxes are the ever-present alternative.",13,0,1443545168,1444723040
cvi4ifu,0,t1_cvi1pm9,dsws2,"Space habitat designs are being improved, occasionally, by amateur hobbyists.  But no serious effort is being made, because the basic design options (toroid, dumbbell, cylinder) were figured out in the 1970s and the improvements are incremental.
