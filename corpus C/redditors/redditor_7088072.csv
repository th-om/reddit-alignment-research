1. Extreme political polarization.

2. Heavily divided social classes.

3. Money is ensnared in politics because the US always falls back on the ""muh free speech"" mentality. They didn't have the history of ""reasonable limits"" on free expression that Canada has, which has prevented the rise of, oh, hate speech, in this country.",8,0,1444351108,1444729992

cvt4juz,1,t3_3o109l,7088072,"Back in 2008, when I was three years removed from my compsci undergrad, if you asked me what Vancouver's main tech players were, I would have replied with: HSBC, MDA, EA, Vision Critical, IBM, SAP, TELUS, BCAA, Fortinet, Radical and Nokia. 

Basically, you had one of five choices:

* Public-contract enterprise CRUD at union shops where developers were second-class citizens

* Slave-driving game studios

* Slave-driving hardware companies

* Positions that could be outsourced to Bangalore at the drop of a hat

* Nokia. 

Radical has gone bust and IBM has bloodletted almost 100,000 employees. The union shops (TELUS, BCAA, BC Hydro, etc.) don't even call their software engineers ""engineers"", they're called ""programmer analysts"". Like I said, public-contract enterprise CRUD.

Now look at the landscape today. **Zenefits** is hiring 30 engineers in Vancouver. The city's come a long way.

This is still a small market compared to the Bay or Seattle, but I've kept a running list of Vancouver companies that pay new grads at least $70k base as of 2015. Besides AMZN and MSFT, which do have permanent shops in Vancouver, they are equivalent-ish to FB/GOOG/Uber/Quora/Palantir/Airbnb/Square/Linkedin/Groupon/Dropbox in the Bay/Seattle/Austin/NYC/Boston/Portland/Denver (and to a lesser extend LA/SD/Chicago/Pittsburgh). And, to be honest, you really don't need to pay Uber or Quora salaries in Vancouver.

* Amazon (Mostly SDE I positions in the Fulfillment/Operations division. There are also entry-level SDE positions in AWS but why would you torture yourself working in AWS?)

* Microsoft (Skip the game studios. If the Coalition messes up Gears of War, there will be mass layoffs on a Radical/Capcom scale. Also to any students, skip the Foundry internship and go for the full internships in Redmond, or the [Exploree program](https://careers.microsoft.com/students/explore) if you're in 1st/second year.)

* Thinking Ape (I like the company, but they haven't rolled out any games since 2012ish. Apparently there are whispers their VC is drying up.)

* Mobify (One of the few legitimate game changers in Vancouver. Completely bootstrapped and growing exponentially because companies don't want to build their own custom mobile shopping platforms.)

* Bench (Another legitimate game changer, disrupting accounting software. $7 million Series A round led by Altos Ventures back in January.)

* HootSuite (full stack engineers should easily clear $70k)

* Grouplend (Bringing B2B lending into Canada, finally. I call Grouplend one of Vancouver's ""Three Kings"" of tech alongside Mobify and Bench.)

* SalesForce.com (This is where everyone from the AMZN office downtown go to when they start having families and don't want to be married to their job.)

* Human API (Big Data meets telemedicine. Originally founded in Redwood City with a large office in Vancouver.)

* Clio (mobile apps for the legal market. Who needs junior associates? Their office is in a business park on Canada Way.)

* D-Wave (created the world's first quantum computer, office is close to Clio)

* Ericsson (their office is in the Still Creek Business Park. They pay better than other communications companies in Vancouver.)

* Samsung (a major R&D lab in South Burnaby, but it's not very transit accessible.)

* Intel (there's an SSD office near Broadway and Granville, plus Intel bought Recon Instruments in June.)

* Axiom Zen (makers of ZenHub, Routific, and Timeline.)

* CA Technologies (They bought Level 7 Technologies but didn't fold the company.)

There are probably companies I'm missing (e.g. Visier, Arista, X Plus Z) but that list is what I have solid information on.

Vancouver (and BC in general) ticks off a lot of quality-of-life intangibles you just can't find in other tech hubs. 
It's a much more urban, walkable, transit-oriented city than pretty much any other tech hub in North America. 

BC doesn't have the political dysfunction you see in Ontario or Quebec, certainly not like in the US. There isn't the racial tension or social inequalities you see in the US. The cops are on their best behaviour and there is legitimate civilian oversight. 

Renting is cheaper than most tech hubs (you will not likely find a clean 1 bedroom apartment located 20 minutes to downtown for $850/month anywhere else, not even in cheaper cities like LA, San Diego or Chicago).

Tuition at universities is cheaper than in most tech areas.

A weak loonie means US companies save by hiring Canadian devs, US VC firms are more willing to fund Canadian ventures making up for the weak VC funding in Canada.

Plus since there's no petrodollar anymore and oil prices are falling, the pivot of economic growth is shifting to Ontario and BC. This is good for the software industry in both provinces.

There's a lot of talent in Vancouver, and you don't have to pay then $120K right out of undergrad. The best part is, salaries are rising and it's still cheaper for US companies than expanding down south. VC is less of a pain in the neck, too, if you keep the company in Vancouver you can get by with five-figure seed rounds. Startup assistance from all levels of government is available. (SR&ED, IRAP, IDMTC) Ryan Holmes and Markus Frind are giving back, trying to set up a startup ecosystem. The BCTIA has opened its innovation hub, Vancouver's first (in my opinion) legitimate startup accelerator. 

OP, I'd watch out for Zenefits. Much like Uber disrupted the taxicab mafia and was banned throughout NA/Europe, and Tesla Motors disrupted the car dealership mafia and got banned in several US states, Zenefits is disrupting the HR/payroll software mafia. Fortunately, only one state (Utah) banned Zenefits, and it was reversed after public outcry. They are making an absolute killing with PPACA/""Obamacare"" compliance down in the US. Their office is at 1090 Homer. Look at the salaries: [hiring 30 junior engineers between $110-165K CAD/year](https://www.workbc.ca/JobSeekers/DisplayJobPostingApply.aspx?jobid=238251&from=EmployerProfile), with 40 hour weeks. At the moment, the highest salaries for new grads are with AMZN and MSFT, which hover around $85K CAD base. And AMZN requires you be married to your job and work on-call once a month.(though if you're on /u/Nerdbuddha's team, he'll give you a lieu day if you have to be tied to your laptop and it's a statutory holiday.)",48,0,1444349119,1444729992
