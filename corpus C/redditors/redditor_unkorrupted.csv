Of course there were a ton of Republicans who objected to the bill - it put restrictions on gun ownership and went out of its way to protect the rights of women and minorities. Rush's dittoheads were calling for ""one-strike-and-you're-out"" laws, and there were plenty of angry people who might have gone along with that.

But this is really classic. You start off accusing Bernie of being too conservative on guns and tough on crime, then post your proof as a gun ban and imperfect bipartisan compromise. You don't want to hear Bernie's actual analysis of the bill, or what motions and amendments he tried to add, because you're busy rewriting history to score cheap points.",2,0,1444404247,1444724636

You mean the assault weapons ban? The one Bill Clinton signed in to law? 

Amazing that such a popular and bipartisan bill is now so toxic that it causes both sides to play the blame game. 

Here are Bernie's remarks on the floor in 1994, explaining why this bill needed more amendments to truly address the causes of crime:

No, you're being too literal. The food isn't ""lost in transport,"" it's a distribution problem in the economic sense that hungry people can't afford the food - [so it rots in storage](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/india/120712/food-security-hunger-starvation-wheat-prices).

From [Ricardo's 1817 work on camparative advantage](http://www.econlib.org/library/Ricardo/ricP2a.html): 

""if capital freely flowed towards those countries where it could be most profitably employed, there could be no difference in the rate of profit, and no other difference in the real or labor price of commodities, than the additional quantity of labor required to convey them to the various markets where they were to be sold.""

""Experience, however, shews, that the fancied or real insecurity of capital, when not under the immediate control of its owner, together with the natural disinclination which every man has to quit the country of his birth and connexions, and intrust himself with all his habits fixed, to a strange government and new laws, check the emigration of capital. These feelings, which I should be sorry to see weakened, induce most men of property to be satisfied with a low rate of profits in their own country, rather than seek a more advantageous employment for their wealth in foreign nations.""

Ricardo's whole theory of comparative advantage is based on the relative immobility of labor and capital. What's left is absolute advantage, mostly in agriculture.",-2,0,1444158207,1444724636
