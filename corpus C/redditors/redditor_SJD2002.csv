cvsbpn8,0,t1_cvsaens,SJD2002,"Actually only the last part was an anecdote. And you really should read it because you're very misinformed. From a soldiers point of view, of course conscription is stupid. My cousin said the same thing as your friend and I'm glad I won't have to go through with it. No sane person would enjoy 2 years of forced military life. However, national security isn't a matter of what people personally want, it's what the nation needs. By the way, waygook means a foreign country, the term you're looking for is waygookin. ",1,0,1444298994,1444726804
cvs9qyt,0,t1_cvrw2gu,SJD2002,"You're clearly underestimating the ROK armed forces, they are currently more than enough to repel any armed confrontation from the North. This isn't something that happened overnight, it's a product of decades of preparation, training, and cooperation with the U.S forces. It's a good thing people like you aren't in charge of defending South Korea. That mindset of 'the North would never attack' is what made the South so vulnerable and prone to attack from the North right before the Korean War. If it wasn't for American intervention during the war, South Korea would have been swallowed by the North 60 years ago. Yes, contemporary politics lead to the conclusion that any invasion from the North is highly unlikely, but this wasn't always the case. Even until the 80's and 90's there were fears of another Korean War. We are enjoying the fruits of labor that the older Korean generation has produced. 

And since when is it other countries' responsibility to keep the South safe from the North? You do know the North Koreans have dug multiple underground tunnels large enough to transport tens of thousands of soldiers and equipment in a matter of hours, assassinated political figures, and sent spies and special forces to kill specific targets? North Korean threat isn't something to be taken lightly. No, it's not insane to require young men to enlist or spend money to keep the South safe, national security is the number one priority in South Korea and it's something that's under constant threat. The amount of time required to serve and the treatment involved is something we can all disagree with but there is a concrete need to keep a large and deployable army at all times. And by the way, the age of conscription is 18, with the majority deferring until 19, 20 or higher. 

This is anecdotal but I had a cousin that was conscripted and just got out about 2 months ago. He was stationed right by the DMZ, the worst place to be put at, and from what he tells me the equipment, training, and intelligence they have is insane. I'm talking about UAV above a squadron with every member wearing goggles that show an aerial view of the area like a video game, night vision that allows you to see in the dark as clear as day, knowledge of the location of every piece of Northern artillery and troop movement, etc. Not to mention the fact that there are plenty of professional soldiers that aren't '17-year-olds'. Conscripted soldiers make up the reserve forces, they're not the backbone of the army. Get your facts straight buddy. ",-1,0,1444290288,1444726804
cvrfxfh,0,t1_cvrcm5g,SJD2002,"Nah, this is very commonplace even for ordinary Koreans that immigrate overseas like me. I'm gonna guess what happened was these elites sent their kids to boarding schools in Canada or the U.S at a young age due to these countries being somewhat 'easy' to gain citizenship. Since they're children of elites I'm assuming they had connections to get their greencards and citizenship much easier than the ordinary joe, and once they're 18 voila they're no longer forced to serve in the army.

This situation is much more complicated when you're going for a dual citizenship but since these kids renounced their Korean citizenship it's a done deal. ",3,0,1444236741,1444726804
cvrfbq1,0,t1_cvr7ecz,SJD2002,"So the point of maintaining an armed force is to actively kill people? With that logic the American National Guard and the majority of the servicemen that have never seen combat are also worthless. You do realize the imminent threat that the North Koreans pose on the South? The South needs to keep a deployable armed force at all times to prevent another Korean War. Sure the concept of conscription isn't agreeable or sensible but saying that the Korean army has been largely useless is just plain dumb. Not to mention the sinking of ROKS Cheonan being obviously more 'eventful' than the mine incident, you need to talk facts not feelings. ",6,0,1444235853,1444726804
