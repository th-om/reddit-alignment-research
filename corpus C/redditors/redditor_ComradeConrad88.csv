It sounds like you are saying that a Republican shouldn't bother running for President because of the Democratic lock on the electoral college, but the article I posted has nothing to do with that. It's about the Republican lock on the House elections.

I do agree though, to an extent, that a sane Republican wouldn't want to run for President due to the Democratic edge in the electoral college. But it's really only an edge the Dems have, not a lock. If the GOP put out a very electable ticket (e.g., Rubio/Kasich) and the Dems put out a less electable ticket (e.g., Sanders/Warren), it's possible for the GOP to win the White House.

Just fyi; I support Sanders, and think he could win even against Rubio/Kasich (though he'd have an easier time against Trump, Carson, or Fiorina), but I think Clinton is a more electable and would more definitely win against even a very electable GOP ticket.",1,0,1444669445,1444725257

I don't get this, the article researched this and concluded that Republicans were more efficiently distributed than Democrats. Are you disagreeing with their research, or with their conclusion?

See:

> Republican voters have long been more efficiently distributed across House districts than their Democratic counterparts. That’s because a large percentage of Democratic voters are concentrated in overwhelmingly Democratic districts. In the 2012 election, for example, Barack Obama won 75% or more of the vote in 45 House districts and 80% or more of the vote in 29 House districts. In contrast, Mitt Romney won 75% or more of the vote in only nine House districts and 80% or more of the vote in only three House districts. This means that from the standpoint of electoral efficiency, there were far more “wasted” Democratic votes than “wasted” Republican votes in the 2012 election. But this GOP advantage did not begin in 2012. In the four presidential elections between 1996 and 2008, Democratic presidential candidates won at least 75% of the vote in an average of 39 House districts while Republican presidential candidates won at least 75% of the vote in an average of only four House districts.

In regards to your statement that 

> Mathematical models or unbiased panels should be in control of districts, not the current party leadership.

I agree wholeheartedly.

But with regards to your statement that

> Unbiased distribution of districts is core to equal representation in government.

Two points. 

First, within the context of single-member-district (SMD) electoral systems, the article shows how even without gerrymandering (""biased distribution"") the national popular vote for a party in the House can be distorted such that the party gets more or less representation in the House than would be proportional (""equal"") to their national popular vote.

Second, your statement ""of districts"" completely ignores the possibility of using the proportional representation (PR) electoral system (which is used by most democracies). PR is truly the best way to get proportional representation in government.",2,0,1444666674,1444725257

cvganl7,0,t1_cvfjmzx,ComradeConrad88,"Depending on what you mean, I might agree or disagree to varying extents that states are ""better in passing legislation.""

To the extent that many states seem less dysfunctional than the feds, I see at least one kinda obvious answer, which is that the people within a single state are more likely to be closer ideologically than the people of the 50 states.

Also, maybe people don't split the ticket (vote for an executive of one party and legislator of another party) as much at the state level as they do at the national level.

There are also some more nefarious reasons for why states might be unified (such as gerrymandering being worse at the state level).

But even where they are more functional, I'm not so sure that the state governments are a so much better reflection of the views of their constituents than the fed government is of its constituents. ",2,0,1443394625,1444725257
cvfi7vc,1,t3_3mfq22,ComradeConrad88,"I'm a huge fan of the proportional representation method for electing the legislature, and a fan of the parliamentary system as well. I'd love to see the U.S. adopt these systems. But, given that not a single state in the U.S. uses either, it is probably not coming to the national level any time soon. 

Such systems would almost certainly have to first be tested and shown effective by some of the states (the laboratories of democracy) before a super-majority of the people across the U.S. called out for constitutional amendments to make it so on the national setting. As far as I'm aware, there's not even any serious push within any state to adopt the proportional or parliamentary system. 

So yeah, absent a collapse of the U.S. government and a reconstruction of it by whoever into a proportional and/or parliamentary system, you can very safely bet that neither will be adopted at the federal level in the coming decades.",2,0,1443327796,1444725257

Okay, I think I see what you're getting at. It does seem to be a different line from what you were saying previously, however:

> As DeCartes famously said, and as Godel proved mathematically, we all have to accept some unprovable assumptions in order to get on with life.

Considering the reference to Descartes and Godel, it appears you were referencing the requirement of people to accept ""unreasonable"" unprovable assumptions in order to get on with life (such as the belief in a soul or God).

There are of course an infinite number of unfalsifiable claims which people must either accept or reject. For example, consider the following two unfalsifiable claims, which are negatives of each other:

(A) There is an undetectable teapot orbiting the moon.

(B) There is no undetectable teapot orbiting the moon.

The reason everyone rejects claim (A) is because (i) it asks us to accept something which is undetectable to observation (ii) without giving a sufficient rationale for doing so. So it's not exactly like we're just accepting claim (B) on faith, which is what you seemed to be implying. There is a reasonable method to accepting and rejecting unfalsifiable claims.

Now to do it with the ""perceptions"" claim:

(A) There is an undetectable fault with my perceptions.

(B) There is no undetectable fault with my perceptions.

The reason that we accept claim (B) is because it does not ask us to accept something which is undetectable to observation without giving a sufficient rationale for doing so.


> Perhaps everything IS determined down to the quantum level, but what difference can that possibly make in how I think and act? 

First, in response to your mention of the ""quantum level,"" I want to note that I do accept the prevailing theory of quantum mechanics, which is that some miniscule things somehow occur without cause. 

When I say I'm a determinist, I mean that I don't believe the human brain is capable of operating outside the laws of physics, which free-will requires. 

Under Newtonian physics, everything that will happen in your brain is pre-determined. This calls for a brain whose thoughts are all pre-determined. Under quantum physics, at least some things that happen occur at chance, without cause. This calls for a brain whose thoughts are random and without cause, rather than being somehow ""willed"" for.

Neither theory of physics allows for a mind with ""free-will.""


> If we cannot model determinism to a sufficiently fine degree to make precise and reliable predictions, then what is the practical difference between believing in determinism and believing in free will? We all conduct ourselves and structure our society as though free will exists because the alternative is chaos.

I think there are practical differences in how people should treat each other, though I don't believe determinism calls for a chaotic society.

As an atheist, I think the foundational ideas upon which our society was built, such as the idea of the God-given right to free speech, is ""rhetorical nonsense."" But as a utilitarian, I think that things like the ""right to free speech"" are a great thing to have to increase people's happiness. And, as a utilitarian, I think that should be the aim of government (to increase peoples' well-being), which is different from the aim of government under liberalism (to protect peoples' natural rights).

Now regarding a difference. If you believe in free-will, I think it calls for incarcerating criminals more harshly than is necessary. From a determinist/utilitarian viewpoint, you only need to incarcerate a person to deter further bad acts (from the criminal himself or other would-be criminals). Under a free-will viewpoint, you'd add onto that determent reason for incarceration the idea of inflicting pure punishment/retribution on a person for being evil to some extent.


> Beliefs about objectively testable phenomenon are unreasonable when held against the objective evidence, but untestable beliefs are all necessarily on the same logical footing.

As noted above, I disagree with this: unfalsifiable claims are not all on the same logical footing. There is a reasonable method to evaluating them.

cuwrzgd,1,t3_3kbais,ComradeConrad88,"> Rather, it is a combination of average academics, limited civil experience, repetitious and routine criminal matters, writings which ""just do the job,"" serious doubts by respected members of the Bench and bar, and no intellectual spark or legal enthusiasm that carry the day for our Committee. 

I think the ABA's recommendation was probably correct. It appeared he actually had ""extremely"" limited civil experience, for one. And I'll have to take their word for it on the nature of his criminal law experience.

I get the impression that good, even great, academics wouldn't have swayed their decision. Maybe, possibly, if he had stellar academics (e.g., top student at Yale Law with Moot Court and Law Review experience), then that could have swayed their recommendation.

Grades were probably more relevant to him than most other candidates because he had so little experience practicing the law. As someone with fairly low grades at a decent school (who's having trouble finding work because of that fact), even I'd admit that's a legitimate factor to look at when someone has little other experience to look at.

I get the impression that Bunning was nominated (and appointed) because he was simply a really-well connected person. This isn't to say that he hasn't shown himself to be a good judge, because I have no idea, but he didn't really have the credentials to get the job meritoriously.

Being a federal judge is a really important job, and there are tons of lawyers out there with (i) great credentials and (ii) a desire for a federal judgeship. Since the pool is overabundant, we have no need to take risks on unproven lawyers. ",1,0,1441896469,1444725257
