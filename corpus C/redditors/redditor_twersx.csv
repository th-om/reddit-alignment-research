cvxv72r,0,t1_cvx806f,twersx,"There would be way more balance implications from unifying physical damage types than from changing composite to physical and universal to either magical or pure. 

Composite damage had 6 sources - one of which was spirit bear death backlash which is very rarely a factor. Overall the spells had their damages changed slightly to do a little more damage to heroes and a little less to creeps. 

Universal Damage had 6 sources as well, with two of them being passive abilities from ultimate summons and other being a small component of an ultimate ability (Echo Slam). Laguna Blade and Doom are pretty much only relevant vs heroes and their damage was tweaked to be very similar. March got a targeted nerf by changing it to magic damage.

Physical damage on the other hand is relevant for almost every hero and almost every game. Changing this would change how pulls work, how mass summon strats would work, how playing certain heroes would work, how certain heroes farm stacks in the early game, etc. it would have a way bigger knock on effect than streamlining composite/universal damage.

cvx7lt4,0,t1_cvx5p3e,twersx,"if you're going to make exceptions for melee/ranged creep damage vs towers, then why not for Brood spiderlings (chaos - 40% vs towers), lycan wolves (bonus vs most jungle creeps and tower compared to heroes), spirit bear (reduced vs heroes, increased vs most jungle creeps and towers), etc. 

Every creep with different damage types results in certain interactions - lots of small camp creeps take significantly reduced damage from towers which means chen/hotd can use them for tanking during pushes or dives. Without paying heed to these small interactions and streamlining, you will indirectly buff a lot of things and nerf a lot of other things - without increased damage to jungle creeps, jungle lycan would go from risky to downright unplayable. ""Zoo strats"" would become completely different as most summons would deal way less damage to towers but take less damage (going from 125% damage taken by towers to 100% - your change would reduce eidolon damage vs towers by 50%), etc.",5,0,1444676027,1444723494
cvx6ouu,0,t1_cvx1tpw,twersx,"the thing is that most units would then have passives and we get back to the same place where we were at - too much information and a lot of it not relevant most games.

You could just unify damage types of all neutrals and units and then give passives to the units that really matter balance wise (summons, siege creeps mainly) but that would have a lot of knock on effects, even more so than the composite/universal damage type removals.",3,0,1444674709,1444723494
cvwsrqx,0,t1_cvwrjzg,twersx,"at lower levels, the 2 attack speed from stats puts +2 stats at a very slightly higher amount of dps compared to another level in blade dance. the difference is actually negligible but it's still in favour of stats. Once you get phase or MOM or yasha, blade dance levels are better than levels in stats for dps.

Each level in blade dance after the first increases your dps by ~4% (1.25/1.2, 1.3/1.25, 1.35/1.3).

I've played around with jungle juggernaut on dire side a few times and from testing, going EWUUEEE is the most efficient build that doesn't delay maxing blade dance or getting a point in blade fury. Obviously jungle juggernaut isn't ideal but from a pure efficiency standpoint I believe that two points in stats before maxing blade dance is better, the difference in DPS is minuscule but you also get more damage resistance, more hp and more mana.",1,0,1444647535,1444723494
