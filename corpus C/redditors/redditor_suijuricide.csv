Edit: Seriously, downvoted for pointing out a basic logical flaw that every statistician learns on day one? Do you people even know what ""objective"" means? 

I suppose it doesn't help to say that I'm former Army, own several firearms, *and* have a CCW permit but never carry and never train anymore, and I happen to know other vets in the same boat (the Army is good at taking all the sexiness out of shooting), so I'd like to see some actual metrics rather than the alleged experiences of one anonymous person on the Internet...",6,0,1444139693,1444726466

""No, this is *melodic* death metal.""
""Not exactly. More like blackened Gothenburg death metal.""
""Isn't that the same thing as Polish black-death?""
""Well I think it's more black metal than death metal.""
""What kind?""
""Cascadian.""
""Nah. This is transcendental hipster metal.""
""You guys have it all wrong. This is neo-folk NSBM.""
""Sounds like Viking metal to me.""
""Yes but there's a whale on the cover—it's obviously whalecore.""
""But can we all at least agree that it's fucking *metal*?""
""No way. It's *clearly* post-metal...""",1,0,1444137526,1444726466

cvlmfed,0,t1_cvlh6a1,suijuricide,"I had sort of the opposite problem in my limited criminal defense experience. My last assignment in JAG was Trial Defense Services, which is the Army equivalent to the public defender. My clients were mostly junior enlisted Soldiers who were intimidated by officers and seemed to think that I was actually working for their commander (i.e. the prosecution), so they'd never, *ever* admit guilt or give me a full picture of what happened.",3,0,1443792118,1444726466

cvll0gg,0,t1_cvks332,suijuricide,"Yeah, my brain doesn't work that way. I started out at a boutique med mal defense firm, mostly handling their appeals and motion practice (we got our cases on flat retainer from a self-insured hospital with a GC who encouraged us to be thorough, so the workload and pace were manageable). It was a pretty good fit, but a few years and an Iraq tour later, I moved to another state and got bait-and-switched into joining a chaotic high-volume insurance defense firm. Night and day. I couldn't get anything done with all the distractions. After six months, I hung a shingle doing appeals and transactional work. Boring, but at least I could focus.",3,0,1443788822,1444726466
