cvx5xow,0,t1_cvx3bcb,MxM111,"In some sense whether it is trivial or not depends how much time on your current level of knowledge is required to understand something or guess yourself how it works, and how obvious the conclusion of particular statement is.

The way you argue the position means that nothing in the world is trivial, because any statement with respect to the real wold would involve a very complex world. Even things like ""if you shoot the bullet into somebody's head, that person likely will die"", a trivial statement by all measures, can be argued that you have to know how the process of explosion of the gun powder works, how then the energy is transferred to the bullet, how bullet travels through the gun first, then through the air, and finally through different parts of the head. And how then biology of a human brain will lead to particular outcome with particular injuries. And this is not even evolving quantum-mechanical nature of the world.

And yet, there is no problem to call things trivial in our world, contrary to the logic you are using.
