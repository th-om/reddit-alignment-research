Only liberals believe it's a problem if mistakes are made in the course of executing people? We as a country have decided it is important to execute people using procedures that do not cause pain unnecessarily. Should people who commit worse crimes receive more painful deaths? Nobody cares about this piece is shit rapist/murderer. And I'm glad he's dead. But wanting vigilance in the practice of execution is not something to scoff at.  ",8,0,1444676868,1444726172

Naked in your bedroom: fine

Naked in front of your living room window that faces the street where kids walk: not fine

I don't think you can purposefully expose yourself to someone who comes to your door. There is an expectation that you will be dressed when you open the door for someone.

And if you are a man ordering a pizza and a woman delivers, then God help you because you're going to jail. ",6,0,1444064090,1444726172

Is Qatar a questionable place to visit? My father-in-law was there for business a few years back. Should I be concerned? I mean, the royal treatment this kid is getting is ridiculous, but why would his family decline the invitation. Shit, I'd like a free trip to Qatar, it's supposed to be a pretty nice place to visit.

cvesho7,0,t1_cvejq4r,the_fewer_desires,"You bring up good points. I think part of my hesitation with Carson relates to Obama. I believe that Obama's inexperience governing was a major reason for the partisan gridlock he experienced. As smart and skillful as he was in some respects, he had never been in a position oh governance and it showed. He couldn't broker deals between opposing groups. Other presidents have been similarly dislikes by the opposing party, but were able to use what the party members wanted to achieve compromises. I hope Carson would have that interpersonal and leadership qualities, but for me it's a big unknown. With someone like a former governor, for instance, there is evidence of at least minimal experience in this regard.  ",1,0,1443276770,1444726172

But I personally don't think Carson's prestige in a field unrelated to the job he seeks makes him more qualified. I understand people's frustration with career politicians, but I find it perplexing that so many people would be okay with the president of the United States having absolutely no political or governing experience. In what other profession would a person be considered more qualified for the top position because of their lack of experience? I want my pilot, physician, accountant, and mechanic to be experienced. I want my president to have experience doing the job he or she will have to do.",3,0,1443196377,1444726172
