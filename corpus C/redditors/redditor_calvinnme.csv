cvph4c3,1,t3_3nkmqd,calvinnme,"I realize I'm pretty much repeating others, but I also feel it is because guys equate being able to get laid to not being lonely. Under the right circumstances any guy will be willing to have sex with you - and that's it. They'll leave skid marks on your carpet on their way out the door the next morning. 

It kind of says a lot about the FA man. He is really just looking for sex and nothing more. ",3,0,1444086747,1444727171
cvmvab6,1,t3_3n25sa,calvinnme,"Men, not just FA men, tend to often be cowards. They won't just come out and say - ""There's no chemistry, let's break it off."" Thus they treat you like crap hoping you'll break it off so they can be the victim. Listen carefully when he talks about his past. Does he have a bunch of sad stories about how he had a bunch of relationships but was always being dumped? That's a sure sign this is his M.O. Plus, unlike women, guys are almost purely visually stimulated. This is kind of sad if you think about it, the ugly guys think they are settling unless they have a beautiful girl, where women can look at the whole package - intelligence, sense of humor, kindness, and THAT makes them attractive to the point that you cease to notice what they look like.

Long story short - give him what he wants. Dump him so you can be free to pursue somebody who really values you as a person AND he can whine to the next girl about how you dumped him ""for no reason"". ",4,0,1443891250,1444727171
cvmuxbx,0,t1_cvmlym5,calvinnme,"Or you could do it in reverse order like the girl that took away the one true love of my life - really just a one-sided crush, so I can't really blame him. He never dated at all until he moved to San Angelo for his job. He was 23 she was 20. They met in March, got engaged in May, married in September. She only had a HS education, he had an engineering degree. They had two kids together by the time she was 30. When she was 40 she went back to school and got her BS in biochemistry. Then when she was 45 she told him that they were moving to wherever she could get into med school or they were getting a divorce. They got a divorce but she cleaned his clock in court. He wound up having to pay for her med school - all of it - and her settlement also paid for a big house in Minnesota which is where she wound up moving after she got a job at a clinic up there. So his big executive career  yielded zero bucks by the time she got through with him.  Oh, and she cheated on him during the marriage too. True story.",1,0,1443890627,1444727171
cvmtcjj,1,t3_3n69qj,calvinnme,"When I was in my last semester of my senior year of college I was sitting in a classroom just before class and I looked across the hall to see a girl who was also a senior electrical engineering student working in the EE dept. office. She was decorating the office Christmas tree, hugging and kissing her fiancé between throwing tinsel on the tree, and surrounded by guys who were helping trim the tree, but from a distance you could tell by the way that they looked at her that they would love to take the fiancé's place if they had the chance. We were both on the plain side, and both very klutzy (we had a PE class together, that's how I knew this), and her personality was OK but nothing to write home about. Yet in this environment of engineering school where the ratio of women to men was 1/15 at the time, she was starting to check off the milestones in life and I realized that in four years of college I had not one person ask me out for a date, or for that matter really notice I was alive unless they needed help with homework.  What was ""that certain something"" that she had that I did not? No she did not have inherited wealth! I never figured it out and I never have. 

Did I fail to mention I'm 57? So I have a lifetime of female FA experience. One important thing to note, just looking back on life. College is the best time to find yourself and find someone. If you are in high school, you have to remember everybody you go to school with is just tied to you by a common zipcode. That's it. But in college you'll be in class and informal settings with people who have the same interests as you by major - business, science, engineering, music, etc. Never will you be in the company of more young men that are probably still unattached and have the same interests as you. Once you graduate you go to a specific company and will probably only see the same dozen or so people every day who may be much older than you and many already married or attached. Even at that young age it becomes much harder.  Just my two cents for whatever it is worth.

cviprkm,1,t3_3f21cz,calvinnme,Then there was a psychiatrist in Kentucky who stabbed his own patient back in 2010 and got 15 years. He'd been having an affair with her - big no-no - and been caught repeatedly having affairs with patients. Plus he was writing tons of scripts for the victim - she came to him for drug abuse. He also seemed to have a big drug and liquor habit himself. It makes you wonder why Kentucky kept letting a doctor get away with this stuff until it erupted into violence. ,1,0,1443570738,1444727171
cvfu51d,0,t1_cvfpnnx,calvinnme,"No, my menstrual cycles ended when my doc upped my thyroid medication at age 46. I was diagnosed hypothyroid at 44. My sex drive ended almost exactly at my 38th birthday and predated any other health problems I later developed.  That's why I gawk in amazement at women over 40 who still want sex. The only use I ever had for men was sex and home and auto repair, and now I only need them for home and auto repair - unless you know a good female mechanic? You might say all my life I was like many men - the primary need I had of the  opposite sex was for sex. I've always had my own money. I have never cared about them on an emotional level, and I never wanted to have any children, although I do like children. I just didn't care to have any of my own.",1,0,1443368094,1444727171
cvfglcz,1,t3_3ev98k,calvinnme,"I don't know about the kids part - I never had any. But from the time I was 11 and began to go into puberty I had a high libido. I'd say I was almost a sexually predatory young woman. Then on about my 38th birthday it was just like my libido got unplugged from the wall. Absolutely nothing. I can't do HRT because I'm diabetic - the progesterone makes my blood sugar skyrocket.  Ever since age 38 the idea of men sexually is like that of an eight year old as in ""ooh gross, boys have cooties"". Honestly, I'd never even look at a man again except for home and auto maintenance and repair. I'm 57 now so it was not a temporary thing or a menopause thing. In fact, menopause itself was a breeze for me. I had a  few hot flashes that were just like flash bulbs going off in my head - they were that quick. No night sweats, crying, personality changes, etc. I actually went through menopause from age 42-46, when cycles ended completely. And I mean from having monthly cycles all through ""the change"" to having none. I always thought it was strange that things actually ended when my doc upped my dose of thyroid medication - I'm hypothyroid too. Sorry if TMI.

cv6pwjl,1,t3_3lfzxy,calvinnme,"About three dozen House members are refusing to sign on to ANY budget that funds any portion of planned parenthood. Now Speaker Boehner could get enough Democrats together to pass a budget - I mean there are 435 total members - but the 3 dozen tea party GOP holdouts are threatening Boehner with a contested speakership and possible loss of his leadership position if he does that . Thus Boehner wants to be speaker more than he wants to actually DO ANYTHING. If a budget with funding for planned parenthood passed the House, it would pass the Senate, and the President has sad he would sign it. Long story short: Three dozen House members are holding the government of 300 million people hostage, all to placate the members of a few snake-handling evangelical groups in the deep south who seem to care tremendously about unborn people, but not a whit for those already walking the earth. For those of you from other countries who say this all sounds like a stupid way to run a government you are half right. This is very stupid but this is not running a government - it is paralysis.",1,0,1442644255,1444727171

They are usually nerdy little guys afraid of their own shadow. Her employer is going to be paying your girlfriend major bucks if this goes to court. Now I preface all of this by saying I am a female engineer in the U.S. who works with software engineers, that's why this is all so strange, but I believe you of course. If this happened in a country that is not in North America or Europe, all bets are off. It's just sad that humanity has fallen so low that this is considered acceptable not by one guy, but by two, and that they planned AND went through with it.
