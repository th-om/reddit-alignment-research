A lot of my anxiety stems from my mind focusing on other places, events, or possibilities; being able to ground myself in the place and time I'm actually experiencing helps to alleviate that. (Of course, this might not help if your problems are rooted elsewhere.)

I've also been reading David Allen's *Getting Things Done* lately, and though it's targeted as a business book, I find it has a lot of productivity tips that help on a more general scale. Allen focuses on getting to-dos out of your head and into a simple, reliable external system with hard and fast rules, and he emphasizes the importance of conclusively deciding what to do about something *before* actually doing it. It reduces reliance on our imperfect ""monkey brains"", as /u/mindofmetalandwheels would put it, and I've found that it dovetails nicely with the whole ""in the now"" ideas of mindfulness meditation, too.

cvmwios,0,t1_cvmjlmx,ShimmerScroll,"Congressional delegates vote along party lines because that's what their constituents want. Remember, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor dabbled ever so slightly in bipartisanship, and he got so thoroughly crushed in the primary that he didn't even finish out his term. Voters in his district saw their interests lying in a stronger, ideologically purer Republican Party. A similar phenomenon has been playing out in districts across the country, places that are so entrenched in one party or the other that candidates have to worry less about the other party and more about being seen as insufficiently loyal to the Cause.

Term limits aren't going to fix this. In fact, I submit that they would only exacerbate the problem. Fresh legislators don't have a record to run on, and voters would have no reason to realistically expect that they would actually stand up to party leadership when it was legitimately in the district's best interests. Plus, in an environment where less than 10% of seats are legitimately contested by more than one party, new legislators have to toe the party line if they ever hope to make it to the general election. Term limits would only strengthen the stranglehold that the parties hold over the electoral process in most of the country.

This problem would be much more effectively approached through electoral reform. Implementing a system like single transferable vote would promote a more diverse and representative legislature and help loosen the reins of party leadership on their actions. Alternatively, we could embrace the party system more fully by implementing some form of proportional representation.

I also don't understand this opposition to professional legislators. Congress is, in many respects, a group project with hundreds of teammates. It takes time for any group to settle into a productive working pattern, let alone one that large, and continually replacing the whole body means that valuable time for debating and legislating is instead spent bringing everybody up to speed on how the process works and waiting for them to find their place in it. This is always going to be an issue in any democratic government, but I see little point in making it worse. Furthermore, these people are managing the world's largest economy, overseeing its most powerful military, and governing its third most populous nation with laws that routinely run for hundreds or thousands of pages. I, for one, would like them to know what they're doing.",1,0,1443893387,1444720788

cvl6kym,1,t3_3n600e,ShimmerScroll,"Some of your proposals, I don't really know enough to have a decent opinion on. A couple I agree with. These are a few that seem to me to be either poorly thought out, or just plan bad ideas.

> 2) Term limits on all of congress (one term, 6 years).

I'm not sure what problem this is supposed to solve, but it certainly creates a whole host of other ones.

Not only would this utterly destroy any sort of institutional continuity, you would never have a Congress who understood from experience how Congress works. Every election, the House would have 435 Representatives who would have to introduce themselves to each other, get to know each other, and figure out where everyone is in the political landscape. And six years later, they're all fired and the process starts all over again. The only people left on Capitol Hill who have any experience in the legislative process will be lobbyists, who will happily steer each fresh class of newbie lawmakers towards the bills they want enacted.

This proposal also completely obliterates any semblance of accountability. After the electorate casts their votes on Election Day, they have absolutely no control of what their new Representatives says, does, or votes for during his term. At no point are they incentivized to ask what their constituents want or need; instead, they should be asking who can offer them the cushiest job once their term ends.

> 6) Make Social Security optional or remove it. Millennials think its a waste since they're told they won't get anything back.

Just because people are living into their 80s and 90s doesn't mean that they can still work. Your candidate would have to explain to grandparents with arthritis and osteoporosis and diabetes why they need to back into the job market—which is already struggling to reach and maintain healthy employment—or risk starvation. Not to mention plenty of younger people drawing a Social Security check due to a crippling disability. Like it or not, millions of Americans depend on Social Security to keep them housed, clothed and fed. Taking that away would have very real, very negative effects.

Also, AARP would torpedo any candidate who even hinted at something like this, and I wouldn't blame them in the slightest.

> 7) bring more offshore jobs home, no option is off the table to get it done

Okay. How?

> 8) Put class size limits in place for education, hire more teachers if needed. Make it a priority. 

The President doesn't really have much say here; I'd talk to your Governor instead.

> 10) If congress can't pass bills, or keep this country running, then they're suspended without pay with no hopes of getting it back.

How many bills do they need to pass? Do they have to have any particular subject, or do bills renaming post offices count? Can we have a budget shutdown if it just lasts a few hours? Are continuing resolutions okay?

And if they have ""no hopes of getting [their pay] back,"" then why even bother legislating anymore? The 104th Congress wasn't even a year into its term when it shut down the government for a sum total of 4 weeks. If that happened with your 6-year, 1-term Congress, then they would have no incentive to not go looking for other jobs, and the American people could easily go for 5 years with no federal legislature.",2,0,1443747241,1444720788
