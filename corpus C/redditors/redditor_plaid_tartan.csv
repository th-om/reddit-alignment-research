cvx3f1h,0,t1_cvx2hzy,plaid_tartan,"Yeah but what about the next time you're in the gym? You should want to increase your overall weight so your starting weight next time would be whatever you started with this time plus some number.

cvx2lo8,0,t1_cvwzwia,plaid_tartan,"At your weight, you are a much higher risk for joint injury than the general public. Please consult a physician preferably a bariatric one. ",2,0,1444668740,1444730526
cvx2j2x,0,t1_cvwzu3a,plaid_tartan,"I'm the opposite. I feel like I can press better after I power clean the weight. Like the weight is now used to going up. I don't do a push press either, so I recognize this is entirely psychological. ",1,0,1444668629,1444730526
cvx2fj1,0,t1_cvwzgsp,plaid_tartan,There are lots of exercises for explosiveness which will get you moving faster once you decide to react. I don't know of anything specific to reaction time though.

cvx2aod,0,t1_cvwz1iu,plaid_tartan,I gained four pounds between Saturday and Sunday this weekend because of Mexican food. It's water and it will go away. Don't worry about it. ,1,0,1444668269,1444730526
cvx27ix,0,t1_cvwzky0,plaid_tartan,"How do you decide when to add weights? Like if you add ten per set, is the starting set this time five more than it was last time? Part of the programming is making sure you add weights at a good rate. ",2,0,1444668127,1444730526
cvx25if,0,t1_cvwyulb,plaid_tartan,That was my experience too. I can squat without them but I like it with them a lot better. ,1,0,1444668038,1444730526
cvx23cs,0,t1_cvwzk2p,plaid_tartan,Seconding the 531 advice as a next step. I'm on it and breaking plateaus like crazy. Do that once you stall. You can even swap it in just for your stalled lifts if you want. ,2,0,1444667947,1444730526
