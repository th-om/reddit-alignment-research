cvu9zrd,0,t1_cvu900n,TearsofaPhoenix,">20% is most of the adult population.

No. For America, 66% of a population is adults. Assume the Jewish population followed a similar demographic. If only one out of every 3 adults had a gun, then 20% of the population would be armed. 

> Not for Europe it is not, it is quite high.

Of course for Europe that is a high amount of gun ownership. The whole premise of this argument is that there is an alternate history where the German population in 1930s was highly armed. 

> I am concluding that the % was quite high. And the support for removing Jews was high. The antisemitism of the Nazis was quite popular.

The Nazi party had 37% support. Not an overwhelming majority.

>Or they might have been killed earlier. And the Nazis would be celebrated today for their valiant efforts to destroy the insidious Jewish menace.

Why would they be killed off earlier? How? If they were armed, there would need to be a massive expenditure of men to round up/fight these insurgent Jews.

Your other argument is grasping at straws. If you know how to shoot, you can be a threat. ",1,0,1444432547,1444722312
cvu9mz5,0,t1_cvthlgk,TearsofaPhoenix,"Germany has forests and mountains. That is enough to fight a guerilla war. This is beside the point though. A full out war is not the endgame. It's the threat of armed resistance fighting for their livelihood that would keep the SS from knocking on the door in the first place. 

I find your point about accepting death of women, children, and invalids a bit interesting. When the Jews were rounded up, they knew they were not going to a great place. They had heard of pogroms before and knew that Nazi Germany didn't like them. Death was a possibility for everyone the second they came with the SS and they knew it. IMO, most people would rather have the ability to fight than just accept that they are helpless.",2,0,1444432370,1444722312

For me, if a member of a government organization that has outwardly expressed disdain for my people came knocking at my door, I am not going with him. They could send people after me, sure, but if every Jew were fighting back, it would take an army bigger than the one Germany had to subdue the Jews.

There also are no jungles in Afghanistan; that hasn't stopped the guerilla war over there. Also, Germany was not completely urbanized; there were plenty of forests and mountains to hide in.

cvu8iik,0,t1_cvu5kl1,TearsofaPhoenix,"that is not a silly assumption at all. If 20% of jews were armed, then 100,000 would have weapons. That's actually a very low amount of gun ownership. And I think you are assuming ALL of germany wanted to kill the jews. They didn't. They were passive bystanders who didn't understand the full scope of what was happening. It still comes down to whether or not the Jews could have resisted the Nazi forces. Without weapons, they were completely unable to fight back, armed, they might have been able to stand a chance.

cvtgyqi,0,t1_cvt9ydy,TearsofaPhoenix,"In 1935, the German army was about 500,00 in numbers. Interestingly, there were about 525,000 Jews in Germany at that time. Now assume maybe 100,00 were armed, and able to fight a guerilla style war. That would take a very significant portion of the German army to conquer. Additionally, the expenditure of men in rounding up the Jews would have potentially a) shifted the opinion of non-radical germans or b) delayed the further expansion Nazi Germany.

cvtgvze,0,t1_cvta1lw,TearsofaPhoenix,"But it's not that simple IMO. Yeah they are only <1% of the population, but if they were armed, trying to round them up becomes a much more difficult problem. Besides the fact that the Nazi army and Jewish population were almost the same size in 1935 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany), a battle in the streets would have stopped many germans from being passive bystanders. I'm not saying that it would have prevented the extermination of German jews, but it definitely would have had a larger impact on the opinion of the general German population than otherwise.

If a student who pulled a 3.0 GPA with average SAT scores sits down and says they want to study dance at a mid-tier school, the bank will not give them the loan. However, if a highly driven, intelligent person asks for a loan, they will receive it. When the government pays for (almost) any student to attend college for whatever degree they like, schools see it as a huge supply of untapped money. ",1,0,1443595733,1444722312
