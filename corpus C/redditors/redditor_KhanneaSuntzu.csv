cvxxxw1,0,t1_cvx42w7,KhanneaSuntzu,"Absolutely. Try envision all financial and political elites world wide who suddenly find themselves living potentially indefinite. Life tends to be a lot of fun when you are rich. Visualise how motivated these elites will be to make goddamn sure the above does not happen. For them at least.

I think life extension would sharply reduce incidence of war, terrorism, crime. People would *really* feel they have something to lose.",1,1,1444723734,1444724139
cvxxwr3,0,t1_cvx7evo,KhanneaSuntzu,"Like lunar dust, mars dust is (1) so fine granular it will inflict lung damage, similar to a miner's lung. (2) there are quite a few rather toxic constituents, heavy metals. On Earth these are washed out and oxidized, on Mars they are out in the open. The most toxic salt is Perchlorate, at *half a percent* in most regions. That's really bad.

If we can muster an affordable treatment for aging, that would be excellent. But I go with Aubrey when he describes treatments as ""recurrent"" and ""complex"". Something along the lines of 10.000 euro per treatment, every decade, at today's currency values.

I suggest that everyone will want those treatments, but the cost imposition for society will mean people can consume less of everything else - including social security payments. My prediction for 2100 is that people will live fairly high-tech lives, but strikingly low consumerist standards. Probably high tech vegan communes.

Throw mass migration and climate change in to the mix and we are headed for nothing but existential paradoxes.",0,0,1444668734,1444724139
