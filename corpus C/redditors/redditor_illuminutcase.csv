Labor force participation rate or did you mean the rate of discouraged workers(U-4)?  

If you're complaining because children and the elderly aren't working, then that's an odd gripe to have. Surely you aren't blaming baby boomers reaching retirement age on Obama, are you? That's the main reason that number is high and will continue to grow.

I think what you meant was the statistic known as U-4 which is total unemployed plus discouraged workers.  You could have even meant U-6 which is the total unemployed, plus all marginally attached workers, plus total employed part time.


However, neither of those is higher than they've been in 40 years, so I'm not really sure what you were getting at.",14,0,1444671412,1444722229

He's like a cartoon version of a rich guy. He's got buildings with his name, gold plated sofas, and diamond encrusted trophy wives.   It's like Harold Ramis and Bill Murray got together in the 80s and wrote a campy comedy movie about an out of touch disgustingly rich guy who grew up in money and ran for president.  This is *exactly* how that movie would play out.
