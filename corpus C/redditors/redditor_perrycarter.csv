The advertising campaigns of the big corporations successfully duped the mass public to believe that soft drinks should be drank with every meal in place of water. 

It blows my mind how successful this dangerous ad campaign was at weaseling into our heads and I'm happy to hear that people are finally coming to their senses. ",25,0,1443847131,1444720711

cvk36xh,0,t1_cvjtovm,perrycarter,"Although it's a funny one-liner, Glossip is guilty.  Read the details of the case.  A comment by TheBaltimoron talks about a few of the things about his story that don't add up but there is so much more.   

>The State presented an enormous amount of evidence that Glossip concealed Van Treese's body from investigators all day long and he lied about the broken window.   He admitted knowing that Sneed killed Van Treese in room 102.   He knew about the broken glass.   However, he never told anyone that he thought Sneed was involved in the murder, until after he was taken into custody that night, after Van Treese's body was found.   Glossip intentionally lied by telling people that Van Treese had left early that morning to get supplies.   In fact, Van Treese was killed hours before Glossip claimed to have seen Van Treese that morning.  ",11,0,1443667080,1444720711
cvk3037,0,t1_cvjwpkj,perrycarter,"Honestly, he sounds guilty to me.  Sneed wakes him up in the middle of the night and says that he just carried out the murder of their boss.  According to Glossip, he didn't believe him and went back to bed.  

Fine, maybe I can buy that.  

But then they hung out all day together the next day. Working together, repairing the broken window that was broken during the murder, looking for their missing boss, etc.  Don't you think at some point during the day, Glossip would say, ""Hey, you know when you said you murdered our boss, were you actually serious?!"" And then I don't know, check the room he was sleeping in, or call the police to check it out.  There is also testimony from another worker at the hotel who said Glossip told her the window was broken by drunk room guests and steered everyone away from the room.  Even if that was true (which is far-fetched) wouldn't you see the body as you were repairing the window?

Too much time passed before he called the authorities.  His story is crazy and irrational, I don't buy it. ",2,0,1443666737,1444720711

We can't allow government agents to carry out street justice against perceived undesirables.  We have a justice system for a reason and all suspected outlaws must go through the due process.  If the police came in guns blazing into every meeting they suspected unlawful activity, we would have state sanctioned terrorism, chaos, and innocent blood would be spilled.
