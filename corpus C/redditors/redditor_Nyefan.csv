Trump, having survived a hotly contested republican primary, wins the general in a landslide thanks to a timely sex scandal involving secretary Clinton.  During his swearing in speech, he dissolves congress, bars all sitting members from holding federal office in the future, and calls for an immediate nationwide election to replace them.  When SCOTUS says that's unconstitutional and he can't do that, he says, ""Marshall had made his decision - now let him enforce it,"" and proceeds to dissolve congress anyway.

Once the new congress is in session, Trump tells them to give him wartime powers, or he'll dissolve them again - they comply.  He then reveals his master plan to the world, declaring that the government of Mexico is unfit to manage its people, and it's high time that America stepped in.  The Mexican government, deciding that the estimable se√±or Trump is preferable to drug lords, complies with his demand of full annexation.  Now comes the clever bit.  Trump forces a bill through congress to build a wall at our new (much smaller) southern border, using exclusively taxes applied to the 5 new southwestern states - they did indeed pay for the wall, just as Trump had promised.

His bloodlust sated, Trump turns his interests to the middle east, enacting massive import tariffs on oil and crashing the economies of the more stable middle eastern states.  Alongside the economic warfare, he announces to the world that any country caught supporting any faction in the now boiling middle east will be on the receiving end of the first ever declaration of nuclear war.  There will be no warnings.

Caught up in the excitement of the new age of American expansion, the once beleaguered populace overwhelmingly re-elects president Trump for a second term, where the real work begins...",1,1,1444690676,1444717079

cvwbvsn,0,t1_cvwadap,Nyefan,"Well, I don't have any literature, but I can provide an anecdote.  During undergrad, I worked in a graphene lab developing growth and transfer techniques for cvd graphene.  Another lab at a different university was having difficulty creating graphene of the same quality as we were making, so I went down to help them with it.  I could not, for the life of me, figure out why the results at the two labs were so different.  Toward the end of the week, I finally realized what the issue was - I had been performing each step one after the other, but, back in my home lab, I had been doing one step per day in an assembly line format and then putting the samples away in a nitrogen box overnight.  Nowhere in my original procedures had I written that down or considered it important, since it was a habit born primarily for expediency's sake.  I feel like most difficult to replicate procedures in the harder sciences are as a result of something like that.",5,0,1444605029,1444717079
cvw9tns,0,t1_cvw77gm,Nyefan,"Not everyone comes out early in life.  There are plenty of people who end hetero relationships with children in order to come out - one of my roommates in DC did just that.  My boyfriend is only out to three people as well, and he's 24 with a stable job and independent from his parents.  Unfortunately, his family are all Adventist, so he hasn't felt comfortable coming out to them.

I guess the point of my rambling is that you're not alone, and you don't have to feel pressured to come out until you're ready.  It's scary.  And when you are ready, we'll all be here rooting for you.",3,0,1444601514,1444717079
