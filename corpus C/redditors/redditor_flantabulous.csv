Did he keep them on a secured server?

Did he follow proper protocol?

Did he share them with anyone who did not have proper clearance?

Does Gowdy even have proper clearance?

It couldn't be that now that she is a private citizen running for president, and negotiations are over, she's decided she's against it?
