cvr5q33,1,t3_3nsglv,son_of_bokonon,"So cool, I like the Odd Thomas feel this sort of has to it. So, this can easily turn into a much longer story, even a novel, if you want it to. Just from what you have here, I'd take a little more time explaining how the sound effects the kid. Point out to a specific situation that makes him hide for hours, compound that with the parents thing, and really dig into how it sets him up as the awkward hero.  

Going from that, you can easily take this into the main story about finding the other people. That in itself can be a long story. As I said, it's got an Odd Thomas feel to it, and you could easily use the first book in the series to give you ideas on how to expand on the supernatural sleuthing thing.  

Also, you've got plenty of room to expand on the whining as well. Are the calls for help being channelled into the kid somehow? Is he receiving feedback from angel radio? Aliens playing games with humans by implanting chips to turn them into supernatural crime fighters? There's a ton of avenues this can take, and with a bit of planning and well paced hints, you could turn this into it's own story arch.  

Overall, you've got a decent set up. There's a bit of cliche in there, for sure, but you've got a solid working model. The kid has a purpose now, so all you really have to do is flesh out the personality (don't focus it around the whining. Instead of just earphones, why not drown out the sound with music?) and give him an adventure to go on. Make it tough for him and don't reward him properly. Leave it open for more adventure.
