cvx2p05,1,t3_3ofzz0,Personage1,"Batman Begins and Spiderman relying on Neeson and Defoe respectively.

For Batman we have an Austin Powers concept of a villain, they have the word ""league"" in their name for crying out loud. The concept for them is hilariously silly.

Defoe makes Spider Man imo. The story was eh, the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane seemed too forced, and the animation was distractingly bad. Having a good villain made it get there.",2,0,1444668885,1444729727
