cvalacl,0,t1_cvakhxc,FuckConcepts,"Indeed. I didn't mean to suggest they were unjustified, more that Obama's message and pleas for civic engagement aren't enough in this case. 

What I do wonder, and am having trouble finding info on at this point, is if after 2016, the rate hikes might slow dramatically? Is it possible that because so many people who never had healthcare before now finally had access to medical care, they received expensive procedures/drugs/treatments etc. that made the premium hikes so large, to deal with the large up-front costs of treating a disadvantaged populace? 

If that's the case, then maybe now that people are healthier after finally getting long-term issues taken care of, rate increases will slow in the future. Short-term pain, long-term gain kind of thing. ",2,0,1442953723,1444725473
cvajii9,0,t1_cvadv8e,FuckConcepts,"Haha I figured this would turn into a discussion on efficacy of the ACA (no problem with that), but thanks for bringing up my original post. Since I think the healthcare is such an important issue going forward, I'm curious as to how it will play in what I believe will be one of the most important presidential elections of our time. I'm sure people say that every four years lol, but to me the potential to (probably) appoint 3 Supreme Court justices makes this a ridiculously important one (among other things).",2,0,1442951156,1444725473
cvajbih,0,t1_cva5ygh,FuckConcepts,"Thanks for bringing in this info. In the NYT piece, Obama talks about people putting pressure on state insurance regulators to scrutinize the premium increases. Looks like that's not happening. I happen to be for universal healthcare, but I think Dems will have to be very clear and careful in their messaging on this issue in 2016.",4,0,1442950876,1444725473
cvaj2ou,0,t1_cvaadk0,FuckConcepts,"I'm with you BagOnuts. Regardless of what was originally promised, I think plenty of people came away with the impression that this bill would make healthcare cheaper and easier to get for everyone, not just keep the poor or those with pre-existing conditions from getting jerked around by rapacious private insurance companies.

I think it hurts the Dems, but at the same time I also don't see Republicans gaining as much ground as some think because they will (likely) say it needs to be abolished, which would possibly mean throwing millions off of healthcare plans. 

Bernie Sanders *might* be able to come out looking better on this issue since he's campaigned for single-payer for so long and can say the ACA didn't do enough, but still voted for it b/c of Medicare/Medicaid expansions. But even then, the Republicans did a fine job of beating the scary socialism drum on ACA, it might hurt Sanders with moderate Dems/undecideds.",0,0,1442950522,1444725473
