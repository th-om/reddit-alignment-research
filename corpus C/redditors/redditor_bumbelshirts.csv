cvob0hi,1,t3_3nga7e,bumbelshirts,"A lot of Bernie supporters do a lot of really fucking stupid things. Like, I saw a thread on the front page last week, from /r/SandersForPresident. It was a picture of a guy in his new Bernie t-shirt. Just a fluffy selfie. Harmless. Great, right?

Well, in the title. He admitted he wasn't even American. He's *Swedish*. Ok, a little weird, getting that involved in another country's political process, but ok. He bought the t-shirt from Amazon, so that's fine. It's not like he directly contributed to the campaign, right?

Well, **he did.** And he admitted it. In the comments of his own thread, he said that he had donated through his official campaign website. He gave the campaign money. **Directly**. Ignoring the warnings about how illegal doing so is. Ignoring them, or just flagrantly disregarding them. And instead of downvoting the thread and telling him how wrong he was for doing that - the complete opposite happened! 

They thanked him for his (***illegal!***) contribution. And a couple others in that same thread admitted to doing the same thing! Foreigners! Contributing money! To the self-identified socialist candidate! The headlines write themselves.    

The mods eventually deleted the thread, but by then, I think, they had about 4,000+ upvotes. Full of mostly-supportive and appreciative comments. Again -- contributing to political campaigns, as a non-citizen, non-green card holder, is *very* illegal. But /r/SandersForPresident doesn't care about that.

""Get money out of politics!"" Right? Unless, you know, you're European and you want to contribute to *my* candidate. In that case, it's fine. ",15,0,1443999024,1444719122

ct9horb,1,t3_3dv3y0,bumbelshirts,"YouTube pulls the same shit. You know the channel 'Vsauce'? Very popular, very well-known. They stole their channel from someone else. Ok, 'stole' is maybe the wrong word. They 'asked their friends who work at YouTube to give them the channel because they liked the name'. 

Seriously. Some poor sap had his channel scrubbed, all his videos removed, all his likes and favorites and so on, all of that was deleted and his channel was given to someone else - just because they had ties to YouTube, and they wanted it for the name. 

Is it illegal? Of course not, it's a free country, a business can do what it wants. Is it scummy? Abso-fucking-lutely. It could happen to anyone. Me, you -- ANYONE. If people with the right connections or status decide that they want what you have, they can take it. ",6,0,1437378533,1444719122
