cvxai8u,0,t1_cvx8g3y,cmmgreene,"> Revisionist history is big part of the problem with millennials' lack of even a basic understanding of real history and how not to repeat it.

How are they any different from conservatives who want to go back to some idealistic America that never exiisted. They want to roll back Roe v Wade, and forget about the civil rights movement, totally forgot about the rampant poverty in much of America.  No milenials don't have a monopoly on revisionist history.

cvwy4ou,0,t1_cvwwyc8,cmmgreene,"> My impression of my one and only jury trial was exactly this: Legal theater for the benefit of the jury.

And there in lies the rub, even your own over worked under funded public defender will advise you to take a plea over the risk of a trial. If a defendant can't afford fancy bells and whistles to dazzle the jury they have little chance of winning. 

Say what you will about the Serial Podcast it opened my eyes on how much a trial is theater, how a defendant can be judged by jury just based on how looks at trial. The reliance on pseudo science and so called technical experfs. 

Final juries need to be educated on CSI fallacy, just because cops say that they found a suspects DNA doesn't necessarily mean anything.  Samples can be missed handled, and prosecutors have been known to exert their bias on those testing samples. ",2,0,1444661460,1444717516
cvwuxqt,0,t1_cvwsopo,cmmgreene,"What makes me anti death penalty is the fact a person has to  slowly accept that they are dying for a crime they didn't commit. The emotional roller coaster of the appeal process. The slow decent of madness of living the remaining days on the row. I don't know why it's not classified as cruel and unusual punishment.  Yes I know there are some truly horrendous people on death row,  but 12% of them are innocent.  That's too much in my opinion. ",0,0,1444654724,1444717516
cvwub0y,0,t1_cvwt6hu,cmmgreene,"They get a bad rap, because in the public eye only a criminal/guilty person would get a professional high priced defense attorney. If you are innocent you take your chance with the public defender, or you never would have gone to trial. All this stems from complete faith in the criminal justice system, or people who never witness the lunacy in person. 

Full disclosure I never have witnessed it, but over the years I learned it's more theater than actual justice. The state has an overwhelming advantage, and Prosecutors will use all of them to get easy convictions. To be honest I don't get why we give Prosecutors immunity when they convict the wrong person.
