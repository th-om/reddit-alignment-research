cvksoe7,0,t1_cvkecfe,DiscoConspiracy,"Yes, two-way.  Government does not promote or favor one religion over another.  Government does not force the religious, of any religion, to directly support something they're against.  The balance is not putting religious laws that not everyone agrees with into public laws.  It's important that government both at the national level and local level be considered.

Also another question:  Would you be comfortable definitively stating, without question or doubt, that voter ID laws are not meant to discourage or suppress LEGITIMATE Democrat Party voters (whatever their ethnic group or beliefs)? What do you think of poll taxes and should the monetary expense of obtaining documentation, if there are no free alternatives, be considered a poll tax?",1,0,1443725230,1444721555
cvkr0b6,0,t1_cvk30uc,DiscoConspiracy,"I think sroskes is onto something regarding branching out from RPGs.  One could argue that 5e, which I enjoy, has more ""support"" for noncombat that 4e (which I also enjoy, though I had no trouble running noncombat in that system).  If you go in expecting something like 3e or Pathfinder from 5e, you may be disappointed.  5e seems to go further back into pre WOTC for its feel and inspiration.  For old school fans like myself, that's a feature.  There are still choices to be made in classes, but I don't feel it was as extensive as 3e.

So I would also consider branching out and experimenting with other systems, as long as your group is ok with it.  Burning Wheel is really great.  Character generation is quite detailed and helps create a believable character.

If you don't mind anthros, I believe Mouse Guard has a scaled back version of Burning Wheel powering it.  There is also Ironclaw in Jadeclaw, but I cannot speak for its noncombat support since I haven't read too much of the books.  Further systems like The Strange, Numenaria, or Savage Worlds might interest you and your group.",1,0,1443722815,1444721555
