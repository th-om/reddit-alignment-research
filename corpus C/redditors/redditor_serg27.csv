cvultes,1,t3_3o6wi8,serg27,"Meh, you might be able to argue the whole ""mutually assured destruction"" thing as a deterrent but I don't know how sound that is or how much it relates to this.

I think the main thing wrong with this argument is that obviously guns are much more accessible than nuclear weapons, so in reality it's probably not fair to compare the two in this way. The difference between a rock and a gun is that in most cases it's easier to kill a person, or multiple people, with a gun. And the difference between a gun and a nuclear weapon is that very few people have access to a nuclear weapon in the heat of the moment.

No reasonable person thinks that guns magically animate and go on murderous rampages by themselves. So it's true that the person, and not the weapon, is responsible for any intentionally violent act. But it distracts from the main concerns about guns, which are accessibility, mobility, and lethality. Rocks are typically accessible and you can walk around with one in your pocket, but they aren't really as lethal as guns. And nuclear weapons are certainly lethal, and you might be able to fit some sort of dirty bomb into a relatively small space, but you can't run to the Walmart and pick up highly enriched uranium. 

So, there you go. I'm not an expert on any of this but just my opinion.",9,0,1444461711,1444730072
