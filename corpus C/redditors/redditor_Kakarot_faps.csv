cvvwksg,0,t1_cvvosrq,Kakarot_faps,"I would be angry at both. But I'd think of it like this - if my brother was killed in Iraq as a soldier, I'd be mad at the people who killed him as well as the government that sent him there. But I'd also recognize that he chose to put himself in that situation where he knew going in that he might die. The people in Benghazi were entering a highly hostile country and would fully know the risks. Here's a better example- if I decided to park in Gary Indiana and my car was broken into - I'd be more mad at the guys breaking into it than the parking garage or police. But I'd realize ""you did choose to go to Gary dude there was a good chance this would happen"". It wasn't London where this type of thing would be incredibly unlikely. ",3,0,1444580557,1444730336
