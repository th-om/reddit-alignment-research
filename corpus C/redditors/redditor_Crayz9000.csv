cvxijkd,0,t1_cvxgvir,Crayz9000,"The problem is that we've already gone and given the mother of all tax breaks to the rich - top marginal rates have dropped from a high of over 90% under Eisenhower to the current 39.6% rate, to say nothing of all the other deductions and loopholes that the top bracket can use.

Are you familiar with the economic principle of diminishing returns? That's the basis behind the Laffer curve, and it's generally sound. The problem with the GOP's current interpretation of the Laffer curve is [they have no idea where the intersection of maximum revenue and minimum tax rate is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve#/media/File:Laffer-Curve.svg). What the Laffer curve predicts is that tax revenues will start *dropping* after some point - meaning that further tax breaks will *not* increase revenues. Based on the current situation, I'd say we're already well into that area of diminishing returns, and as such, there's little harm in bringing tax rates back up.

(We also have very little idea of how far we can raise tax rates before we start seeing diminishing revenues, but considering how imprecise the curve is, there should be plenty of leeway.)

FYI: according to [this table of marginal rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#History_of_top_rates) the worst period for the American middle class was after the [Tax Reform Act of 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1986), when anyone making over the equivalent of $59k today was stuck into the highest 28% tax bracket. No wonder my Republican father complained bitterly about his taxes back then - they actually went *up* under Reagan. The [omnibus budget reconciliation act](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CDgQFjAEahUKEwi4sr_GjL7IAhVG8WMKHe28AZ0&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftaxfoundation.org%2Fsites%2Ftaxfoundation.org%2Ffiles%2Fdocs%2Ffed_individual_rate_history_nominal%2526adjusted-20110909.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFIoLjLNaXMBl9JGJLfGAlsGONHRA&sig2=9lD1QLpmFukE1lrfzg4Xqg&bvm=bv.104819420,d.cGc) ""tax hike"" that Bush Sr. enacted actually *lowered* taxes for most of the middle class, by pushing the top bracket back up to today's equivalent of $142k.",3,0,1444692367,1444717169
cvxhf09,1,t3_3oidu5,Crayz9000,"It's a deliberate loophole because ""middle class"" is generally considered to consist of Americans up to $250,000 in annual income. By putting a discontinuity in the tax between $118,500 and $250,000, it becomes a tax increase that *doesn't affect the middle class*. If he simply eliminated the cap entirely, the GOP would have a field day with how he's ""trying to raise taxes on middle class Americans"" and we'd never hear the end of it.
