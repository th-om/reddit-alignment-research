I had the same experience with a beautiful friend of mine. Had a dream about him a year before we met in real life, but fortunately he passed away a few months after our meeting, but we had a purpose.",1,0,1444341340,1444724242

Animals aren't toys and as with any relationship, sometimes its just not meant to be.

Not sure if you believe in demons but look into incubus demons. They cause sleep paralysis and vivid sex dreams.",-1,0,1444190925,1444724242

cvpy0gk,1,t3_3nod2j,BelindaBerry,"Cats are quite finicky when it comes to major changes in their home.

I was watching a documentary on cats last week and one of the ladies was getting her cat ready for the arrival of her baby. She would rub the cat down with a cloth and then rub everything in the babies room with her smell so it smelled like her.

Maybe try that with your older cat. Rub her smell all over the new kitten (everyday), the door of the room the kitten sleeps in, toys, bedding etc. But keep them sleeping separate until they start interacting.

Have their together play time but also make sure the older cat gets her own cuddle time with both you and your partner, away from the kitten. She was there first and had most of the attention (apart from the dog) so keep doing the same routine as you had before and that way she kind of knows nothings changed.

The longer she's around the kitten the more she'll get used her. It's only been 2 days so hang in there a little longer and good luck.",1,0,1444127509,1444724242

You can use a packet bleach. I use Schwartzkopf Nordic L1++ (although the L1 will probably do for your hair) leave it on till you like the color, then leave it in for another 2 mins and wash out.

Being a natural blonde you probably won't even need a toner.",2,0,1443960109,1444724242
