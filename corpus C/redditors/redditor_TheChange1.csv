Except my parents who have 401k's, which are invested into different companies throughout the economy.  My parents make enough combined to put us in or around the top 10% of income earners.  But that doesn't mean they're saving *shit*.  Sure, my dad has a 401k that is receiving some matching funds from whatever company he works for, but it is nowhere near what he needs in order to make sure he has enough to retire.  But please, tax what little he has tucked away because its a ""miniscule"" tax.

> from a top marginal rate of 39.6% to 50%

Holy shit dude, thats a pretty big fucking leap.  Like, a leap big enough to make me question the economic impact of such a tax.  Creating more tax brackets? OKay, but just raising taxes on everyone above $400,000 is asinine.  

>we could just cut the Pentagon's budget by 10%

Eh, fair enough.  But the DoD does fund new innovations in the process of killing people.

>Why? And how does that address any of the complaints you have brought up?

Because if you have not gathered by now, I am not too eager in expanding entitlements.  I believe in a social safety net, but free college education is not a part of that.  Education is not a right, it is a privilege--always has been and always will be.  If students served for a time in order to ""pay"" for their schooling, then I would be perfectly content with such a deal.  Requiring service before free schooling would A) cause our government pause before sending troops abroad knowing it is no longer a volunteer army and B) would create an atmosphere that brings people of all kinds together and exposes whites to blacks, poor to rich, young to old.

Assuming the jobs come here.  We already have high unemployment among youth, what will happen with more students but less jobs?

>And many other major countries have college paid for by the state. What is so disastrous about that policy?

Does China? India? Russia? Any country that is our size? Ad populum arguments should not be the basis upon which we adopt a free education system.

>Really? So, are you opposed to taxpayer-funded primary and secondary schools as well?

Difference being which taxes.  Property taxes are already high enough, you think people will be happy a higher income tax (or whatever tax).

All i am saying is that there needs to be some service that students need to do before they can qualify for a free college education.  Whether it be in the military, doing charity abroad--whatever.  But just handing out a college diploma for free is not something I am sold on just yet.

As an aside, I also understand that the money paid through taxes would just be changing where the money comes from (I.E. everyone and not just the student/family).  ",1,0,1444699750,1444722849
