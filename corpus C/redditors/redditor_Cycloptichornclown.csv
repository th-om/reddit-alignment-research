Well, that tax is the same as the Swedish transaction tax that killed their markets. When questioned, people say the results have to be different, and better for the US, because of ""American Exceptionalism"".

It also ignores that it doesn't fund the reason for the tax.  And it ignores that if implemented and trading volume goes down (*which he said was the point*), it leaves an even larger unfunded hole in his spending program. 

>the sanders and anti-sanders circle jerks are equally annoying. if you're going to respond to me, i would appreciate that you leave those circle jerk comments at the door.

They pointed out the legitimate flaws with Bernie's plans and pointed out the same thing you just said.  Why didn't you address this comment to /u/spaceghoti as well if you feel so strongly about it?",4,0,1444676698,1444718074

Are you discussing his ""progressive Scandinavian tax plan"" that ignores that the Scandinavian nations do not have a progressive tax system compared to the US?

Or are you discussing the financial transaction tax that was implemented in Sweden and killed their financial markets, moving it all to other nations?  When questioned, people say the results have to be different, and better for the US, because of ""American Exceptionalism"".

cvpmer8,0,t1_cvpa5sh,Cycloptichornclown,">Almost every republican candidate wants to end birthright citizenship (or at least says so) and definitely every democratic candidate and our president wants more gun control

Only one candidate has announced anything that is different than Obama's position. 

[Earlier this year, the Feds raided Chinese birth rings for citizenship](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/03/03/california-chinese-birth-tourism-raids/24338087/).  Those individuals were stripped of citizenship and deported (some were already out of the country as they would birth and then leave).  

Its not a universal position in any sense to go further than the current administration's policy.

cvctx89,0,t1_cvcrw5c,Cycloptichornclown,">he's not the most radical person on the GOP

He doesn't share most of the common opinions of the GOP.   

It would be like a right-to-work, pro-life and devote Catholic, anti-white Democrat running. 

The GOP is much more diverse than the Democrats at the state level, such as governors, Lt. Governors, and state houses.  Unfortunately, Trump is a fairly open bigot and seems to be actively working to reverse that. His anti-hispanic statements are horrible, and even though he has identified as a Democrat 13 of the last 15 years (*including the most recent 4 years*), they will be attributed to the GOP as a whole. 

Trump has very inconsistent opinions on the issues, flip flopping by the day.  While this behavior doesn't make him a radical, it makes people more familiar with politics uncomfortable.  From broad tax policy (*sometimes he is in favor of flat taxes, other progressive*) to specific tax policy (*positions on 1030 exchanges and carried interest for example*) to claiming that higher incomes need to pay more taxes (*while he doesn't voluntarily pay more him and pays significant amounts to legally lower his tax burden*).   He wants leave free trade agreements and add tariffs to imports while claiming that this will make us more competitive (*other nations will just raise tariffs against us in return*), he proves he is clueless on economic issues. 

And it doesn't help that he is close to Hillary Clinton, all of which unfortunately adds to the myth that he is a false-flag candidate.  Again, he has identified as a Democrat 13 of the last 15 years (*including the most recent 4 years*).  

He isn't going to win the core of the GOP and continues to collapse as more people observe his antics and realize that he shouldn't be taken seriously. ",2,0,1443118839,1444718074
cvcovlx,0,t1_cvbya5l,Cycloptichornclown,"Its more than he has very inconsistent positions that conflict with each other.  He seems to be working hard to tick off hispanics and he doesn't share many views with the GOP. 

As the polling continues to show, he isn't attracting people that vote for the GOP.  He is attracting new voters and moderates, which is fine.  But its not accurate to claim that there aren't valid reasons why many in the GOP aren't fans of him. ",2,0,1443111599,1444718074
cvbfaam,1,t3_3m0yez,Cycloptichornclown,"*Sanders* - Complete joke.  The only reason that he has made it this far is because the media doesn't take him seriously and won't question him on his policies.  If he had half the scrutiny that Rubio, Bush or Trump had, he would have collapsed weeks ago.   The good news for him is that if he wins the nomination, he will lose hard.  He will become the face of the Democrats tea party that will do well in 2018. 

*Clinton* - Terrifyingly corrupt.  The closer we get to the primaries, the more you will see come out.  Cattle futures bribes, uranium sale after they donated to her, her acting on behalf of UBS to the Treasury department for a tax dispute right after they donated millions to her, foreign donors in the Clinton foundation, email deletion and hiding, etc.  She also will start attacking Sanders as she falls in the polls and he rises, which will be interesting. 

*Biden* - Most likely to jump in as Clinton collapses.  He knows that nominating Bernie will cause the Democrats to lose hard. 

*Trump* - Loser.  He will be gone soon, no point discussing. 

*Carson* - Smart man, terrible politician.  He had some support and lost it all already by allowing his words to be twisted.

*Rubio* - Gaining now, smart man and good politician.  He will most likely get VP.  He shouldn't have dropped the senate race, but good for him for making it clear he wants to win. 

*Kasich* - Not going to win, doesn't really matter.  He is hoping that everyone else fights each other and he is left looking good.  Won't happen.

*Bush* - Will win the nomination.  He knows its a marathon and knows that quick movement in the GOP polls is dangerous.  Better to be competent, well funded, and tactical without demanding press or making boneheaded moves (*like Clinton trying to win airwaves with claiming she would unilaterally limit biotech patents*).
