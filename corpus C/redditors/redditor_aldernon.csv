Having said that, it's more entertaining to see people shit on LA teams than the Knicks so I'm okay with it.",3,0,1444699116,1444722233

Other than that, good socks with a pair of shoes that you don't mind getting filthy. 

Other than that, bring a good attitude and check out what other people have- if you like them, consider investing in one.",2,0,1444638504,1444722233

Then again, I'm a bit of a Cal homer. Oh well!",1,0,1444636669,1444722233

Flip side, walking back to AT&T took me from 4x surge to no surge... Probably saved a shitload, so worth it lol",1,0,1444516969,1444722233

The walk just felt like forever. Nice because it was on the embarcadero and all, but long. I'd leave 45 minutes to an hour for it. ",1,0,1444514045,1444722233

I want you to know something.

A quote is generally demonstrated by one of two things on reddit.

It will either look like

> Doc said the Warriors were lucky they didn't have to play the clippers recently

Or look like

""Doc said the Warriors were lucky they didn't have to play the clippers recently""

A PARAPHRASE (meaning not word for word) generally looks like 

Doc said the Warriors were lucky they didn't have to play the clippers recently

So next time someone says something like

> Doc said the Warriors were lucky they didn't have to play the clippers recently

Without offering quotation marks or a quote formatting, you might want to consider- are they paraphrasing? Should I go after them for not providing word for word evidence? In this case, you got downvotes into oblivion because you decided to ignore that fact and pick a fight over a technical thing that is quite irrelevant.",3,0,1444487014,1444722233
