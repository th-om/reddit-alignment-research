cvblb33,1,t3_3m38yu,DerJagger,"Yeah, no, it has not ""exploded"". On all the twitter analytic sites I checked this hashtag doesn't even show up. I haven't found a site that says it broke more than 600 individual tweets, and the most shared tweet containing that hashtag is from conservative Ben Shapiro lampooning it. It never succeeded in trending anywhere in the US and now all the left-wing news outlets are trying to pump some life into it by manufacturing a narrative of it ""exploding"". You know how the right likes to drum up support for their cause by blowing things way out of proportion? Well, the other guys do it too. ",3,0,1443030863,1444731236

cuz1bop,1,t3_3kkr2b,DerJagger,"> Despite Iran's rocky relations with the U.S., both Iranian president Mohamed Khatami and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei comdemned and denounced the attacks and the terrorists who carried out the attacks. Iranians who gathered for a soccer match in Tehran two days after the 9/11 attacks observed a moment of silence. There was also a candlelight vigil.

>Huge crowds attended candlelit vigils in Iran, and 60,000 spectators observed a minute's silence at Tehran's soccer stadium

OP conflated the number of attendees at a soccer match with the number of people attending the vigil (which is not given). Obviously this was removed because the title is inaccurate according to the source.",0,0,1442071894,1444731236

Hasn't been implemented yet so we can't say yet if it really brings peace.

That was a national embarrassment and was more Putin's doing than Obama's.
