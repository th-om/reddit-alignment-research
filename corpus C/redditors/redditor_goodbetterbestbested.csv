cvtbdfz,0,t1_cvtaz0n,goodbetterbestbested,"The spinning made me nauseated, and to be frank, there wasn't much room in the coffin. It got pretty messy down there. Not as messy as it was when I was down and out in Paris and London and forced to work 16 hour shifts at hotels for little to no pay. Not as bad as having to put margarine on my French bread instead of butter. And not as bad as hearing conservatives trot out Animal Farm and 1984 as somehow supportive of their ideologies when a quick glance at my biography on Wikipedia and statements regarding those books would demonstrate that I was just as opposed to capitalism as I was to Soviet-style socialism. I mean, heck, the only reason I wrote those books was because I felt Soviet socialism was giving my socialism a bad name. Engels' angels, how did that even happen.

But when I first heard of racism puffin on /r/AdviceAnimals, I knew it was time to come back and haunt the living. I orchestrated the banning of that avian monstrosity and have kept mostly in the shadows since that time.

But now. Now is the time I have chosen to come back and fight the tide of capitalist maymays with my comrades. Four legs good. 2500 upvotes even better.",19,0,1444360470,1444717059
