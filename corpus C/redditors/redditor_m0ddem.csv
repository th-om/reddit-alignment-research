Frontier feels like it's a giant **H**.  

The middle lane of course being the core of the H; there are a bunch of blocking structures to either immediate side that impedes sightlines, which few if any Halo maps introduced.  There's also a really badly conceptualized open warehouse on one side and a much more defensible closed base on the other; I feel like this is really badly balanced.  Especially in big game types, I notice that going into the no man's land is a death sentence unless you can sneak around the periphery; going through the middle lane is a complete meatgrinder.

On Rift, the team that consistently lemmings the middle spawn the best on that map and can eventually grind to the back gets control of the entire game; from there, spawn camping is a given and the exodus of quitters begins.

(This, of course, denotes what I've been saying about Rift on certain maps in that the gametype would benefit massively from a ""Round Over"" mechanic a la Griffball or Elimination, to prevent spawn camping and potentially to swap spawns and balance otherwise unfair maps)

My final analysis of the map was proven pretty thoroughly in my opinion that when Inferno Clash started availability this week and I got that map at least a dozen times, gameplay improved *considerably*; not having a motion tracker to immediately pinpoint and eliminate aggressors in the backfield or no man's land meant that one team couldn't effectively turtle up and just punish people.",2,0,1444687891,1444721475
