cvwha73,0,t1_cvw0ueq,saqar1,"There is a rumor/theroy going around that they're not going 100%. They're saving their 'A' Game for the big opponents at the end of the year.

I'm not sure I believe it, but it seems smart. They do seem to turn on when they want and start punishing these teams.

We'll see when they play MSU and MI later this year.


Now MSU not falling suprises me. They're playing terrible and getting lucky with their wins IMO. They could have easily lost the last two games if their opponents didn't screw up. I hope we expose them next week.

add on: in the AP poll at least MI is the highest ranked with a loss. That just appears to be the human bias of undefeated must be better than a 1 loss team. Hopefully that will be sorted out near the end of  the season when those other 11 teams start playing tougher opponents. ",2,0,1444614989,1444724726

You'll see him a lot in the powerplay just waiting to blast one in, which you wouldn't get if he was cycling with the forwards.",1,0,1444613493,1444724726
