cvvyq47,1,t3_3obqa5,Spifmeister,"I did not feel like a father until the baby was born. Intellectually I know the baby is coming, but I did not have the same emotional attachment to the fetus that my wife did. I was excited and happy that my wife was pregnant and that we were having a baby, but the child was not ""real"" until he was born. 

You experience the pregnancy, it is real to you because your body is changing, getting ready for the baby. You can feel the baby inside you developing. You have a very different experience that is hard to share with your husband. The father does not get to experience those things that helps make that emotional attachment and loss more poignant.

Your husband may be dealing with loss differently. Do not dismiss your own feelings on this, you should talk to your husband about how you feel. He is thier for you. Understand that people deal with loss differently, and recover in different ways. ",3,0,1444584308,1444730546

the boyfriend did not talk to OP before hand. I have meet strangers in bars or airports 
who talk enthusiastically to me about the tattoo(s) they are going to get. He can get what he wants, but the lack of communication about the tattoos is a serious flag. It says something about his mindset  and personality that he would not share this desire with her at all. 

OP talks about her attraction which is both visual and mental. Our decisions, our choices, how we include and share our minds with our SO is a strong aphrodisiac. OP boyfriend did not share this with her, so she can feel less attracted to her SO. 

And you can get off your high horse.",5,0,1444495217,1444730546
cvte4ku,0,t1_cvt86oh,Spifmeister,"The Canadian Prime Minister has more power and control over their party then their counterparts in the UK and the Australian. It is not the parliamentary system that is problematic, it is the powers of the PM and the PMO that needs to be changed. 

In the UK, Conservative MPs have voted against the party on many occasions. Recently in Australia, the Liberals voted to change party leader and thus Prime Minister. So a more accountable PM can exist in a parliamentary system.

In Canada, the Prime Minister has too much control on the House of Commons. It should be up to the House not the Prime Minister to proroguing parliament. Yet the GG sided with the PM over the wishes of a combined Liberal/NDP/Bloc coalition to keep Parliament open. Remove the strangle hold of PM over the Commons and we might have a more functional parliament. ",3,0,1444366028,1444730546

I think this goes way beyond what is expected of a girlfriend. I would be very uncomfortable and embarrassed if my mother asked by my SO to wipe her ass.

You also need to talk to your SO about the future care of his mother. I would set firm boundaries on what you will not do for his mother, even when married.",195,0,1444285065,1444730546
