cvrx532,1,t3_3nv455,AbsoluteRubbish,"I live in a neighborhood off Horton road now between Guess Rd and Duke st.  It's great and I love it here.  All my neighbors are great! We regularly will sit on each others porches and have a beer or two and chat, had a big neighborhood BBQ a few weekends ago, etc.  I know some people mentioned traffic on Horton road but it's never really terrible, I'll even walk my dog along it no problem most days.  It's a straight shot down Duke St. into downtown and only 10 minutes from campus, hiking in Eno, Life and science museum.  Basically, I couldn't be happier.  ",2,0,1444262939,1444721057
