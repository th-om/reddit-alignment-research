Even though the same service is rendered, due to labor costs, the prices are different. This price difference would theoretically be leveled out by PPP.

cvjjyy7,0,t1_cvjijfl,jambajuic3,"Engines can work under two conditions: rich or lean burns. In a lean burn, it is more air and less fuel, and in a rich burn, it is more fuel and less air. 

Lean burn works by increasing the temperature of the burn. This is great if you want to improve MPG; however, this also causes increased production of NOx. So in essence, you need to use more fuel to reduce NOx emissions.

If you remove all regulations and instead tax the fuel (diesel in this case). All of the automotive companies would switch their diesel engines from rich-burn to lean-burn and consequently NOx emissions would increase. Not to mention, companies would ditch their Ad-Blue system, filters, and etc. (weight reduction = increased MPG) and you would definitely see pollutent, SO2, and NOx emissions increase dramatically.

Automotive companies are allowed to literally allowed to reduce waste by removing unnecessary things (seats or stereo for example), modify car to improve drag (remove side mirrors), 'enhance' the engine by lubricating it with a special oil, and even add a specialized gas mixture into their tires when conducting tests to pass EU standards.

At least in the U.S, once in while EPA will test the vehicles themselves as an 'audit'. This is how they found out that Hyundai had been misrepresenting the MPG numbers.",6,0,1443636525,1444726692
cvjj7hd,0,t1_cvjfqkf,jambajuic3,"What do you mean by combined emission standards? From what I understand, both US and EU track NOx, CO2, and HC separately. Your vehicle won't be allowed to pass NOx requirements in EU if your CO2 emissions are lower. 

I agree with NOx limit being higher in the U.S. vs. the EU, but the limit isn't [arbritary](http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/09/20/20greenwire-so2-nox-air-pollution-standards-fail-to-protec-11689.html) and why is the stricter regulation bad? Unlike CO2, NOx emissions have immediate effects on respiratory health, city smog, and other [nasty things](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/234026/e96933.pdf?ua=1). 

In fact Paris is looking to significantly reduce and in some instances even ban diesel cars by 2020 and it looks like London might be the next big city to follow suit. 

By the way, with the increasing regulations for CO2 and HC emissions, the auto industry is going heavily towards electric vehicles. By 2030, the majority of the vehicles on the streets will be HEVs or EVs. This is much better than diesel engines since you will reduce CO2 emissions as well as maintain a low NOx profile.

cvj79in,0,t1_cvj22ca,jambajuic3,"I don't agree with this. The issue isn't about CO2 emissions, it is about NOx emissions. Improving MPG of a vehicle isn't as effective as adding specialized systems (i.e. SCR) to directly reduce the emissions. You can't create incentives for the automotive companies to reduce NOx emissions by simply taxing fuel.",13,0,1443616787,1444726692

I honestly don't think the costs of medicine is the issue. In fact, drug costs in Germany and Japan are very comparable to the costs in the U.S. It is just that people consume more medication and like to consume more brand name medication in the U.S.",3,0,1443535891,1444726692
