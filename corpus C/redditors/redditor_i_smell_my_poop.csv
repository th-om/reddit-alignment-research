It's not that I hate Democrats, it's that I hate Republicans too. 

I support good ideas, not party lines.

Caesar was of course infuriated and insulted that his greatest former ally and leader of Rome was killed by the order of some ""child"" (Ptolemy was around 11 or 12 years old at the time)

The child was given a sword and in return lost his throne to Cleopatra and the Library of Alexandria was destroyed (Roman Civil War)
