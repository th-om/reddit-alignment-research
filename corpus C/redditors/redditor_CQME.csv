It may be a good idea for the sake of familial relations to go in to something like this with the intention/expectation of not seeing your car again, lol.

Bush had one of the most capable Secretaries of State in recent memory.  Colin Powell was extremely popular in both parties, very highly decorated, and of extremely sound judgment.  Bush then told him to jump off a cliff, and so he did.",16,0,1444289066,1444719110

Your ""quick search"" yielded the facts that China is attempting to implement universal health care (i.e. they don't have it yet), and that they're undergoing a pension crisis due to the privatization of their state-owned enterprises (i.e. the socialist utopia where the state provided everything, education, child care, retirement, lodging...everything but sustainable income).

>The pensions have been in place for decades

No, they were dismantled around when China entered the WTO.  They were bloated with debt at the time because the industries that offered pensions (i.e. the state) were simply not profitable and not competitive.",10,0,1444281953,1444719110
