You think the massive deployment of marksmen in insurgencies like Syria is an outlier? 

> I did not say they were useless, but they are not significant. You are not going to win a war with just marksmen.

You are not going to win a war by any one thing alone. The use of marksmen is and was coupled with other insurgent activities. 

> It is a rare person who is willing to kill then they see their target in their sight and the target is just standing.

Is it? How do you account for the numerous people killed by marksmen in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria? 

> How many of those guns in the U.S. are set up for full auto

The U.S. Military doesn't even have a full auto option for the m16/m4s. These weapons are still extremely effective. 

>  And how many bullets do they have? 

A quick google search found that American civilians bought between one and two billion dollars worth a year. Reloading is pretty prevalent and would probably increase in an insurgency. 

> The amount of ammunition needed for combat is staggering.

For the conventional force, this is true. For the insurgency, not so much. The insurgency doesn't require fire superiority as part of doctrine. 

Yea in Iraq and Afghanistan we would unload  1000 plus rounds to suppress a single marksmen. He or she was only popping off a few rounds.  ",2,0,1443985555,1444719865

Long range marksmen have been heavily utilized if every recent insurgency I can think of. They can be used to inflict casualties and pin down units. Additionally, they are asymmetric by their very nature. 

Where did you get the idea that the use of marksmen is useless? 

> Almost none of which are useful in a shooting war.

You don't thing access to Ar15s and AK 47s are useful in a shooting war? Your opinions here are really fascinating.
