It was good when they were actually trailer-length videos. And structured like a faux trailer.

Now it's practically Shorter Cinemasins.",13,0,1444513616,1444717588

Remember when there was that video on the front of /r/all about the Saudi man brutally beating his servant and the comment thread was full of Reddit-Brave comments like ""This happens all the time over there"" / ""Middle East is full of the most racist shitty people ever"" / ""I can't wait until we have green energy so they they can go back to fucking their camels"" / etc. 

And now here's a thread about how Middle Eastern, Singaporean and Korean airlines have ultra-luxury service and attractive, fawning staff.

Her speech is just more evidence that Hillary is a quintessential 90s centrist Democrat. Too bad for her the country, the public, and the Democratic base have moved quite a bit since then.

I am just *waiting* for Hillary Clinton '16 to say anything - anything - on the subject of laws regulating video games. It's going to be a delicious trainwreck.",6,0,1444101065,1444717588

The point is he's not talking to you. 

When he tweeted **""Net Neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet""** he didn't believe that. He's not Louie Gohmert or Sarah Palin. 

In fact Cruz was ***policy director for the FCC*** in Bush's first term, he actually understands the Internet & broadband more than most politicians. If you google ""Ted Cruz FCC director"" you can see that he gave many wonkish, detailed and level headed presentations on various telecom issues.

Rather, that tweet is a piece of political genius intended to rile up his moron base (people *like* Louie Gohmert and Sarah Palin) to fight for a corporate cause.",9,0,1443327415,1444717588

cvfcmr0,1,t3_3miw0v,Deggit,"Probably not. I became a fan by watching **early season RvB** episodes around 2006-2007. At that time I was aware of the RT site and watched some content like **Fails of the Weak** but I never got into AH during the Geoff/Jack era. 

Years later (2012) I became a fan of AH when I discovered **Rage Quit** on Youtube without knowing the AH-RT connection. Then I discovered their Minecraft series when I watched **Wool Collecting Part 2** and their larger Let's Play shtick with episodes like **London Olympics 2012**.

-----

The important commonality is all the above content is **SHORT**. 

RT/AH have almost stopped making quality, **deliberately short** content. RT/AH have not stopped making **GOOD** content but they have really made **GATEWAY** content less and less of what they do compared to 2012ish.

- Their flagship show Minecraft is now CONSISTENTLY an hour a week, often a fairly boring hour, whereas in 2012 it was 20-30 minutes

- Every time they introduce a new series it gradually balloons to 15-20 minutes. Go, VS, and now Presented With Comment which has practically become a 20 minute show...

- Many small series like Rage Quit, Fails, Trials Files, Hunt have either been canceled or become unfunny chores for the crew.

- AH produces ***orders of magnitude more content*** now than 2012 so even if they did produce good gateway content it would be ***BURIED*** under their avalanche of podcasts, LPs and weekly-obligation shows.

This is why Funhaus was such a breath of fresh air. There was a time when almost all of the videos on their channel besides Dude Soup were 5-8 minutes, although they too have drifted from that a little bit.",27,0,1443315699,1444717588
