You also conveniently fail to mention that Sven had already received multiple warnings from Riot about his interactions with other players, and basically changed his name with the express purpose to offend.  Hai's finger was a one-off, a joke, and you're making a big stink about absolutely nothing.

>I want to point out for the people that see a flaw in the comparison which can be discussed separately that Hai's finger violated the 2015 World Championship Rules.

Wrong.  I'm assuming you are referring to Rule 9.1.3.  
> A Team Member may not take any action or perform any gesture directed at an opposing Team Member, or incite any other individual(s) to do the same, which is insulting, mocking, disruptive, or antagonistic.

This rule applies to ""opposing Team Members,"" i.e. those sitting on stage who you are opposing in the game.  C9 was playing AHQ, so AHQ were the ""opposing Team Members"" not any members of Fnatic.  Febiven was giving his analysis on the desk with Sjkoz.  But if you still think the rule applies, then Riot would need to punish Febiven as well, since his statements (as evidenced by Hai's response) were clearly ""antagonistic.""

In short, this post is nothing more than a whine at Riot, and has no basis in any rule.  I can't believe I wasted this much time in refuting you, but honestly the whiners in this community are really getting out of control.",0,0,1444652633,1444729966

I took the LSAT in the fall before I applied, so I was kinda stuck with the score I got.  My score wasn't horrible, and I like the law school that I got into, but I know I could have done better.",3,0,1444011218,1444729966
