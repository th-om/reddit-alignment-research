>She worked to build the coalition to oust Qadhafi and stop massacres in Libya.

[Actually the intervention in Libya was a complete and utter disaster, based on cynical manipulation and brutal realpolitik](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/07/hillary-libya-nato-qaddafi-obama/).  Clinton's role in the Libya debacle is a reason to *not* support her.  

Other reasons are just vague, and supported by any no-name politician or bureaucrat who's part of an establishment, like ""engaging in economic statecraft"", ""bringing the State Department into the 21st Century"", ""supported the raid that ~~brought bin Laden to justice~~ killed bin Laden"", etc. ",1,1,1444709236,1444720516
