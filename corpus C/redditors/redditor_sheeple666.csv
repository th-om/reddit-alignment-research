cvwoi6j,0,t1_cvwizhx,sheeple666,"you know it's sort of late and I told myself I was going to give a proper response.. which I probably will do tomorrow but

I was *just* talking to a friend about how child care is treated really differently in the US vs. Europe and how I thought that affected gender equality issues. 

People talk about how ""traditional gender roles"" are not as highly emphasized in places like Scandinavia where women work almost on equal footing with men, but people don't really mention that Sweden is considered the best place in the world to have a child. 

Literally, before the child is born you are confident and certain that you will have support. Between midwife, nurseries, and pre-schools the whole responsibility is never laid on a singular individual. 

of course there are many other factors involved as well, but I think the way that they treat pregnancy and child birth makes a big difference.  

That might not have been an appropriate response but I promise I'll get back to you when I wake up with a clearer head",1,0,1444630338,1444725275
cvwh56m,0,t1_cvw9zbs,sheeple666,"I think part of the controversy are situations where the birth mother feels pressured into agreements without a 100% certainty. From what I've learned from this subreddit, there are even cases of an agency making promises to either parties with no legal obligation to follow through.

At the same time, I listen to your story and it absolutely sounds to me to have been the right way to go about it. 

I think it's complicated. Like you said, each person has a different story. So I think hard to make any generalizing statements one way or the other. I agree with the general sentiment here that this article was more along the lines of an introductory look at attachment theory and it could have gotten a lot more in dept.",1,0,1444614729,1444725275
cvwg10i,0,t1_cvvz2uz,sheeple666,"That's pretty interesting. I don't think I've ever heard anybody oppose infant adoption. I think I can see how someone would want to adopt as early as possible (maybe to encourage attachment towards the adoptive mother?), at the same time, I totally see your point about the situation possibly steamrolling the wishes of the birth mother. It all seems like a very delicate issue

*Schizoid Personality Disorder is characterized by a long-standing pattern of detachment from social relationships. A person with schizoid personality disorder often has difficulty expression emotions and does so typically in very restricted range, especially when communicating with others.

A person with this disorder may appear to lack a desire for intimacy, and will avoid close relationships with others. They may often prefer to spend time with themselves rather than socialize or be in a group of people. In laypeople terms, a person with schizoid personality disorder might be thought of as the typical “loner.”*
