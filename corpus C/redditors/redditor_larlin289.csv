Flying full attack flights against your neighbours borders are seriously not something a supposedly friendly nation does.

So all information we have points towards Russia already sees Sweden as a NATO country already. Better to get in to get the benefits, sure it would produce a lot of hot air from Moscow but in practices it wouldn’t change a thing in our relations.",2,0,1444596748,1444719769

I do remember that report I disagree with it and from my memory there where plenty that did. One simple point is why international law would apply within Georgia's borders without there being a genocide or something to that effect.

For example, it's widely rumoured that the US has an invasion plan for Pakistan in place to secure their nuclear weapons in the event of the wrong people getting into power and those countries are meant to be long term allies.

That's my whole point, one is openly clearly aggressive sending a signal of hostility. The other is contingencies that you don't communicate and thus are not sending a signal.

If you had read my previous post you had know I don't live in the US so no any more waste in a crap shot of waste doesn’t move me one bit. So from my perspective any money spent in the US is far superior to money spent in Russia.",1,0,1444459077,1444719769

Within the borders of Georgia, by what definition is it illegal? As far as I know there was no internationally recognised peace keeping force and the only recognised government of the area was the Georgian one.

> That's because they ran out of money to do it. The old ways never stopped and considering the tricks that actual allies like the US and Germany do to each other, you shouldn't be surprised that the Russians play their games as well.

I haven't heard about any one else running simulated attacks against nations they are supposed to have normal relations with. Some level of spy game is sadly still expected but the Russians plays harder and more offensively then any other.

I might not be completely surprised but I highly dislike it and consider it to be a hostile act. Still makes it completely rational to consider Russia a enemy country and being quite happy for any loss of income for them.",2,0,1444424632,1444719769
cvtuypt,0,t1_cvtoxuh,larlin289,"> anyone that they feel Russia is a threat. 

Threat and enemy is different things. At least since the Russian invasion of Georgia the behaviour of Russia has been a lot like the cold war. Behaviour that is not acceptable from a friendly neighbour. Things like simulated attacks, likely submarine intrusions, kidnapping officials from neighbouring countries. Things that was normal during the cold war but that we thankfully didn't have during the better years.

This change in behaviour was fairly abrupt and for me at least is enough to just conclude ""alright they see us as a enemy, then I can't really do anything else then see them as a enemy"". ",2,0,1444409307,1444719769
