You don't have the right to be famous enough to get elected President. You can build a name for yourself in lower positions first. 

>He also doesn't represent ""the will of the people"", he represents the will of those supporting him, and he's only allowed to represent those people based on the money he's been able to raise.

So how do you expect this to work? Are you saying democracy is dead because in order to intentionally make yourself famous you need money from somewhere, and since not everyone can be famous it's impossible to have a free and fair election? Because that's the only consequence I see for your logic.

>So if he ended up on the ballot, we'd end up with a Republican president not because the country as a whole wanted a Republican president, but because they decidedly did not want a self declared socialist one. Do you see the point I'm trying to make?

If there's some other prominent politician the people liked better, then he would have won the primaries. The fact that the voting distills to a final round doesn't mean that choice has been taken away, it was just delegated to the primaries.

> The wealthy, and only the wealthy, determine who is allowed as a candidate in the primaries.

No, the people do, by *voting*, and their votes count the same because in the procedure they literally tally how many votes are received and don't look at the bank accounts of who voted. Again, you can vote for whoever you want, but nobody has a right to be famous enough to win. 

>So your answer to ""the poor's vote doesn't count"" is that ""they are allowed to vote for Micky Mouse if they want, so they do count""? Seriously?

How do they *not* count? If every poor person writes ""Bernie Sanders"" on their ballot, those votes will be counted on the Bernie tally. That is how their votes count--in the most obvious and direct way possible.

>I'm not implying anything, I'm saying straight out that twice over the last 15 years the person who received the majority of the votes...lost.

If you don't give any examples, then you're implying at me. I know the election of 2000 was a mess-up, but I'm not here to defend the electoral college. And that's the only one I can think of, so you'd better *say what you mean and quit beating around the bush.*",1,1,1444712683,1444716286

If you can get several thousand signatures, your name is pretty out there. Bernie is all over the internet and cable TV. I think he's pretty established in the national consciousness.

>And if the Democrats don't dump Hillary and get someone actually suited for office to run against him, he might actually make it on the ballot, but he'll never win.

Right, because more people would vote against him than for him. i.e., he would lose a democratic election.

>I addressed the primaries, you just ignored it.

I believe I've responded to this point.

>I've already described why this isn't true. They aren't able to vote for whoever they want, they are only ""given the privilege"" of voting for the people that the wealthy have deemed ""electable"".

They can literally vote for whoever they want. You can put in anyone's name and the electoral system is legally required to honor your vote.

>That is absolutely a bunch of BS as has been proved what, twice over the last 15 years?

What are you talking about? The votes determine who wins. That's how it works. If your'e talking about the electoral college, fine, actually *say it.* I'm sick of being implied at.",1,1,1444709831,1444716286
cvxrk62,0,t1_cvxrb8f,looklistencreate,">No it's undemocratic because the ability to run isn't available equally to all people

The ability to be on the ballot is available to anyone able to amass enough signatures, and the ability to win is available to anyone able to amass enough votes.

>As popular as he may be, Sanders has no chance at the White House because he lacks the backing of those who choose our candidates for us with their money.

If Sanders were popular enough to win a plurality of the vote, he could be President. He's not, but if a majority of Democrats agreed that he'd be the best candidate you bet he'd be on that ballot come November.

>Money makes the votes of the poor irrelevant because the votes of the wealthy dictate who the poor are able to vote for in the 1st place (left with the lesser of two evils). 

The primaries are elections too. They aren't decided by donors but by votes.

>That is not representative democracy.

If the people can vote for whoever they want and their vote is counted and whoever gets the most votes wins the office, that is a representative democracy. Why they vote and who they vote for is irrelevant.

>So you're admitting that the only votes that matter are the votes that come with money attached to them?

No. The voters matter here. You don't keep your political power if a majority of registered voters want you gone. That's democracy.",1,1,1444706609,1444716286
cvxqg56,0,t1_cvxqbk4,looklistencreate,">No they don't, but they also don't take my point of view into account when acting on legislation which is the sole purpose of voting to begin with

Yes, because you're outvoted by people who don't care about the same things you do. It's not undemocratic just because you lost.

>They don't represent the beliefs of their voting block they represent the beliefs of those who will ensure they can get re-elected.

Which is their voting block. The voters hold the power and any special interest has to go through them. In this sense politicians can only do things that won't get them voted out.

Now they may be able to influence people to vote their way, but remember that their influence on government depends on their popularity among the voting masses. In this sense, they can only get the power from a majority that willingly goes to the polls and votes them in.",1,1,1444704074,1444716286

If we're counting [recessions since 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States#Great_Depression_onward), and we disregard the recession of 1945, the score is 3 Democrat recessions to 10 Republican ones. But if we take every recession that happened in the first year of a President's term and blame it on the previous President, that changes the recessions of 2001, 1981, 1969 and 1953 from Republican to Democrat, and zero go the other way. That puts the score at 7 Democrat recessions to 6 Republican ones.

>In fact, if you look at charts, the presidencies of JFK, LBJ, and Clinton were ranked top three in economic growth.

Kennedy and Johnson's presidencies align with the [post-war boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_United_States#Postwar_prosperity:_1945.E2.80.931973). It's unlikely a Democrat would have been able to stop the slowdown in growth in the 70s and 80s; from OPEC to competition with international manufacturing, most economic factors beyond that point were out of the President's control. Carter sure wasn't able to stop it.

Well then go ahead and point to something I said that was factually incorrect. ",1,1,1444703898,1444716286
