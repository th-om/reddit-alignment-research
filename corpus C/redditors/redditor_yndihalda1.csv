cvvhn7g,0,t1_cvve7d7,yndihalda1,"you know why there's a lot less material on liberals? They don't say as much stupid shit. It's that simple.

p.s. Stephen has done several segments ripping on Hillary, same with the Daily Show, and Oliver rarely even talks politics at all.",1,0,1444535526,1444726152
cvujgpl,0,t1_cvu6p2g,yndihalda1,"Agreed. I definitely see where people are coming from, but I loved the surreal nature of the whole thing. It's not the best episode ever, but I personally enjoyed it - especially this closing bit in the OP. I thought it was stronger than some other parts of the latest season to be honest, even if it was just because it was so weird.",2,0,1444453492,1444726152
cvuj9sy,0,t1_cvuihkl,yndihalda1,"Holy fuck dude, that second paragraph. Just... thanks. I thought I was the only one who did that, at least to that extent. And I'm sorry about the girl, I genuinely hope you find someone else to fill that hole; it really is a horrible feeling.",5,0,1444452990,1444726152
cvuj1ly,0,t1_cvug9ov,yndihalda1,"I did have what I consider a beautiful girlfriend, but as of a month ago we are no more. I am overweight, short, and of course have debilitating social anxiety. My depression and anxiety worsened as we prepared for college (which was a huge life shift for me, as I had lived in the same house for 19 years) and finally got to her. (It also didn't help that I was very opposed to her joining a sorority and could not keep from showing it.) So, I didn't keep her, but if you can get one than I would think you could get another, so I'm decently happy with my chances. I have noticed it is very difficult around my age (21 at university) to find anyone who is not focused on superficialities, but my understanding is that the older I get, the more my personality will matter. It's definitely confidence that makes it possible for me, however I have a lot of trouble harnessing it with my SA. 

I also had a girlfriend previously to her for 2 years, she had bipolar and was a handful. I would not consider her much of a catch, at least at that point in her life. That sounds mean, but she was not ready for a relationship and was impossible to deal with, she dumped me via text message, sigh. So, not too impressive on that front.

Point being, and this probably doesn't mean much to you guys, but anything is possible if I, of all people, could hold a relationship with a beautiful girl together for over a year.",3,0,1444452381,1444726152
cvui1p5,0,t1_cvuh4kv,yndihalda1,She was actually named (pop/rock's? Lol) #2 vocal range under only Mike Patton. If you haven't heard any of his stuff I highly recommend it all. ,2,0,1444449883,1444726152

cvucrhs,0,t1_cvtxlfn,yndihalda1,I am not even a fan of opera but I would pay more money than I have to see Einstein on the Beach live. Too bad there have only been like 10 performances while I have been alive. ,2,0,1444438390,1444726152
