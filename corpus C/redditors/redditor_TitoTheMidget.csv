cvx2hgb,0,t1_cvwjl7b,TitoTheMidget,"There are two types of beers. The type you get really cold and drink quickly after doing work outside or helping somebody move, and the type you drink slowly because you just want a tasty beer. Typically one does not stand in well for another. I don't want a Bell's porter after mowing the lawn, I want a cold Coors or a PBR or a Corona. And I don't want any of those if I want something hoppy, or something that's going to warm me up on a winter night.",1,0,1444668561,1444718462
cvx2757,1,t3_3oe631,TitoTheMidget,"What have you already tried? The first few times I had beer I hated it,  but it was Bud Light and shit. The first time I had a decent beer (Sam Adams) I thought it was the bee's knees. Now I homebrew and could tell you all about the virtues of my favorite Midwestern microbreweries.

Try some different styles, see if there's anything you like. If not, don't sweat it - some people just don't like beer. No point in forcing yourself to like something you don't.

Find out if there's a bar near you that specializes in serving microbrews. Ask the bartender what they like. Mention that you haven't really tried much, so you're not sure what kind of styles you'd like. A lot of the time, especially if you go when it isn't busy (read: Not a weekend night), they'll give you samples to try.

If there's nothing like that in your area, pick up a sample pack. Sam Adams and New Belgium are both nationally distributed breweries that have sample packs of a few different seasonal styles. Good way to try some different stuff out.",1,0,1444668111,1444718462

My drama teacher in high school was a real shithead. Nobody really liked him, and we all got the vibe that he didn't like being a teacher very much. But, he cared about the plays, and he wanted the students to be successful.

The drama department never got a budget. As in, literally zero dollars and no cents. All of our props, set pieces, lights, sounds, etc. either came from the donation-based costume closet or from this dude's pocket. I'd say he probably pumped like half a paycheck into each play to buy random costume or set pieces that were niche enough that we didn't have them on hand. The auditorium we performed in was falling apart from lack of maintenance. There were signs in various places backstage proclaiming, alternately, ""Asbestos Free!"" or ""CAUTION: Now entering asbestos zone. Proper face masks required.""

One year we had legitimate cause for celebration because the school decided to give us a budget of $200.

A few years after I graduated, the school cut the drama department entirely. All the money they weren't putting into the budget, they eventually decided they didn't even want to pay a drama teacher, and they wanted the space the department took up to store instruments for the marching band. (In fairness, the band was an official Big Deal, a multi-time state championship winning program in Indiana, where marching bands are a Big Deal. But they were always muscling in on the drama department's space, and as such we kind of resented them. It was the ultimate battle of high school geekery.)
