cvtmewc,0,t1_cvth4g6,swimodelbruno,"Thank you for your post; and the reason I ask that question, is because during a school discussion, we questioned the ways that books were written overall (this discussion sprung up from a talk about ""Commonwealth Literature,"" so we wondered how other counties grouped/classified literature (mostly interested to hear about Anglophone countries). Thank you for sharing!",1,0,1444395001,1444727670
cvtmck0,0,t1_cvsxaii,swimodelbruno,"Not at all depressingly confusing; rather, it was very informative and interesting. More specifically, I like how,  as you mentioned, literary theory is taught through the years, each year almost chronologically.

I appreciate your post and can't wait to share some of this information with my peers.",2,0,1444394855,1444727670

Edit: gold! I can't believe it! As soon as I woke up, I saw this, and had to double check if what I was reading was correct. Thank you!",-1,0,1444342630,1444727670

cvsro4x,0,t1_cvsrb7j,swimodelbruno,"Usually, literature would be groups in classes, such as Latino literature, African American literature, etc. While I'm not sponsoring this grouping, I was just wondering how literature elsewhere is grouped. This is not to say that minority literature is insufficient or inferior; rather, it is how it is often grouped/classified.
