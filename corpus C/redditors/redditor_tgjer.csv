cvxriss,0,t1_cvxr1y6,tgjer,"There is a great deal of research showing that gender identity appears to be built into the neurological structures of the brain, and that those of trans people are more similar to those of cisgender people of the same self-identified gender than to those of the same external sex.

/u/Chel_of_the_sea has put together a number of posts covering this - [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/367d1j/cmv_being_transgender_to_the_point_of_wanting/crbe7vj) and [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/367d1j/cmv_being_transgender_to_the_point_of_wanting/crbe84o) she gives a rundown of some of the many studies involved.

And you have absolutely no idea what it means to be trans. It has nothing to do with *""I have traits A, B, and C, these traits are 'feminine/masculine', therefor I must be a woman/man""*. Among many other things, trans people are no more likely to match culturally specific notions of ""femininity"" or ""masculinity"" than anyone else.

And among the obvious differences between anorexia and gender dysphoria, is that the anorexic *does not recognize their actual appearance.* The anorexic cannot possibly lose enough weight to be satisfied, because they will continue to see themselves as obese until they starve to death. Trans people are under no such delusions, and have an entirely accurate recognition of their appearance.

Moreover, every actual medical and psychological authority has recognized that the gender identities of trans people are not inherently disordered.

And the rates of suicide attempts for trans people are only dramatically different from those of the general population [***before*** **transition**](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885).

This study, which is so frequently misrepresented as supposedly showing that trans people have high suicide rates after transition, actually says exactly the opposite. The study found that transition *drastically reduced* suicide rates, and that for trans people who transitioned after 1989 the post-transition suicide rates were not statistically different from the general population (see Table 2). Suicide rates for those who transitioned prior to 1989 were higher, which isn't surprising given the far more hostile environment they encountered in their transitions, but they were still far lower than the pre-transition rates.

The underlying cultural problem driving mental health problems for trans people is the incredible amounts of hostility, discrimination, and abuse trans people encounter. Trans people who are able to complete transition, and who are not subjected to mistreatment, do not have these problems.",2,0,1444706545,1444725116
cvxqcun,0,t1_cvxpmi3,tgjer,"An anorexic's distress is caused by a fundamental inability to accurately recognize their own physical condition. They don't ""identify"" as fat, they think they physically *are* fat, even while they are starving to death. Losing weight does nothing to alleviate their distress, because their distress has nothing to do with their actual appearance.

This has absolutely no similarity to trans people. Trans people have no confusion as to their physical condition, and distress is caused by the conflict between their internal gender identity and their extremely clear recognition that their appearance does not match. This conflict between appearance and identity is called gender dysphoria.

Unlike anorexia, medication and therapy do little or nothing to alleviate dysphoria. And also unlike anorexia, gender dysphoria *does* respond extremely well to physical treatment. 

Which is why the DSM-V does not regard being trans itself to be a mental illness. It's not a ""disorder"" to have a gender identity; everyone has one. The only disorder is the distress caused by conflict between this normal and healthy aspect of one's psyche, and one's physical and/or social conditions.

This disorder is temporary and treatable. Transition is the treatment. It is the *only* recognized appropriate and effective treatment, and it is extremely effective. Trans people who are able to complete transition cease experiencing distress, because the conditions causing it have been fixed. No distress = no mental illness.

The alternative, attempting to ""cure"" trans people by changing their gender identities to match their birth sex, is not only entirely futile, the attempts are actively and catastrophically destructive. It doesn't work, and the attempts destroy lives. Which is why these attempts are condemned by all major US and world psychological and medical authorities, and there is a growing call to have such attempts made illegal.

Here is the [**American Psychiatric Association's policy statement**](http://www.apa.org/about/policy/transgender.aspx) regarding the necessity and efficacy of transition as the appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria. More information from the APA [**here**](http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/programs/transgender/?tab=1).

Here is a [**resolution from the American Medical Association**](http://www.tgender.net/taw/ama_resolutions.pdf) on the efficacy and necessity of transition as appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria, and call for an end to insurance companies categorically excluding transition-related care from coverage.

If a guy you don't know well offered you a single blowjob, but on the requirement that you move in with him *that night* and live with him for the rest of the year, without any promise of any further blowjobs and no idea whether you're even going to end up liking this guy, do you really think that's an acceptable risk-to-reward ratio?

Because that is the equivalent of the *best case scenario* here. Ask him for a blowjob, he says yes, OP gets a single blowjob, and now he's living in *very* small quarters with the guy. And if it doesn't work out really well, he then has to go to the school or the fraternity and explain that he needs to find somewhere else to live because he asked his roommate for a blowjob and it got weird.
