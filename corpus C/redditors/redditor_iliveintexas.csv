> How is the job market? And pay in Austin?

IT or dev? Both are good. The more education and experience that you have, the better.

> I know the cost of living and taxes are lower but does it make a big difference?

I worked in he Bay Area for a summer. Salaries are lower here in Austin, but costs of living (especially housing) and taxes (no state tax) are also much lower. The last figure I remember is that you would need to make 40-60% more to live/work in the Bay Area (maybe comparable to SoCal)?

> Is it safe? I know there are a lot surrounding cities and neighborhoods which are some I shouldn't consider? (Btw I'm not > thinking about living IN the city)

Depends on where you live. Every city has it's fair share of crime and problems, but violent crime tends to be low if you avoid certain areas. Petty theft is still common. You can identify those areas on SpotCrime.

Since we're talking about safety, Texas is quite a bit hotter than SoCal, so always remember to drink water.

> I'm Hispanic and I'm a little iffy about racial discrimination. Along with that what's the demographics?

I'm White, so I cannot personally attest to what it's like to experience racial discrimination as a Hispanic. Texas's demographic breakdown is [44% White, 39% Hispanic, 12.5% Black, 4.5% Asian](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48000.html). Austin's demographic breakdown is [49% White, 35% Hispanic, 8% Black, 6% Asian](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48/4805000.html). [Austin has detailed demographic information here](https://www.austintexas.gov/demographics). There is still a lot of left over segregation from the past in terms of community planning. There were a number of articles run over the last year about the lasting effects of segregation in Austin: [Statesman](http://projects.statesman.com/news/economic-mobility/), [Texas Monthly](http://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/what-nobody-says-about-austin/), [Vice](http://www.vice.com/read/austin-was-built-to-be-segregated), [Texas Tribune](http://www.texastribune.org/2015/02/23/austin-most-economically-segregated-metro-area/).

I haven't spent a ton of time in SoCal, but my gut says Austin won't be worse. Lots of people of many races and religions love Texas and call it home. I can't promise you're experience will be perfect, but Austin is very accepting of diversity and different cultures and cuisines. Of course, you may find the occasional asshole, but hopefully in very small frequency.",0,0,1444663605,1444718644
