cvx736j,0,t1_cvwqvo7,MajorRollin,"> Immigrants actually commit less crime (at lower ratios) than the native population here

That's not entirely true. Here's a [GAO report](http://www.gao.gov/assets/320/316959.pdf) on the subject.

For illegal immigrants:

>As shown in figure 12, about 50 percent of all convictions for Arizonaâ€™s
SCAAP illegal alien incarcerations in fiscal year 2008 were related to three
offenses: drugs, traffic violations, and assault.
>
>Additionally, the total number of SCAAP illegal aliens incarcerated in Arizona state prisons in fiscal year 2008 was about 6,000, which accounted for about 11 percent of all inmate days.

For immigrants in general (both legal and illegal):

>In fiscal year 2005, the criminal alien population in federal prisons was around 27 percent the total inmate population, and from fiscal years 2006 through 2010 remained consistently around 25 percent.

So, the percent of the Arizona's population that are illegal immigrants is around 6%, yet they're 11% of Arizona's prison population. The percent of total *legal* immigrants is around 13% (and 16% including illegals), yet they're 25% of the federal prison population. So no, both legal and illegal immigrants commit crime at a much higher rate than the native population.

Yes, he's been in Congress longer than Warren or Obama, but that means nothing when Congress will still be either controlled or filibustered by Republicans.

But yes, I have great antipathy towards political correctness. It belies reality and stifles discussion. Being unable to talk or even joke about race is only furthering racism. If I even mentioned that the shooters in the Charlie-Hebo massacre were all Muslim radicals, their only response would be to call me a racist, not think about why Muslim radicals feel the need to murder so many people.

It also pushes people away from the left, who on one hand claim to uphold freedom of speech, but then demonize and censor anyone who says something they don't like. Before Reddit, I would have described myself as very liberal. I still probably agree with liberals on 70-80% of issues, but it seems that remaining 10-20% makes me literally Hitler in the eyes of folks in /r/politics or /r/liberal or /r/socialism, who can be some of the most unpleasant people on the Internet.

You're right that socialism isn't a black and white issue, but I think Paul and other critics of socialism understand it just fine. Organizations like the military or courts or the FDA are inherently socialist in nature, but even the most die-hard ""Paulbot"" isn't suggesting we disband them. However, that doesn't necessarily mean we need more socialist institutions either. We only have to look at the dysfunctionality present in other self-proclaimed socialist countries to see where that leads. For every socialist utopia like Sweden, there's a France or an Italy or a Greece or a Venezuela struggling with the consequences.

Also, when trying to discredit ""people like Paul"", you might want to use a better example. A lot's changed since 1954, and Paul's [concerns about social security](http://www.ontheissues.org/economic/Rand_Paul_Social_Security.htm) seem fairly moderate and are a far cry from ""abolishment"".",4,0,1444520141,1444717380
