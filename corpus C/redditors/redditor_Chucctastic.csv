When I first found this subreddit, the header was the first thing I read, to see what this place is about.

The first thing I saw was ""9,760 NRA Sandy Hookers.""

What the hell kind of ""ImGoingToHellForThis"" text is that? Where's the justification for that kind of subject being cheapened?

Reading on, to things like

>Bottom line? Gun owners have shot 4.5 million Americans in 45 years and managed to kill 1.34 million of them. While some might call that a tragedy, the NRA would call it a good start! 

>CRACK NUTS THE EASY WAY!®
↑ Destroy NRA talking points - like the discredited NRA definition of assault rifle, calling guns ""tools"" (false equivalencies), ""Suicides: I don't care that gun owner kills themselves more,"" ""Guns don't kill people"" and more!

>*According to gun owners on reddit, blacks/latinos don't count when shot, so we only include them for, like, science and stuff.

All just designed to offend pro-gun individuals.

Not to mention, the casual shirking of them as ""nuts"" in nearly every thread I've been in so far.. It doesn't show any effort for discussion, just for nasty criticism. Hence, vitriol.

>it is usually from pro-gunners arriving to downvote everything

Funny, because I've frequently faced downvotes for trying to offer the other side's take on things in this subreddit. It's not a few guys doing it, it's this community going out of their way to not hear out anything pro-gun.",3,0,1444596894,1444718130

So why be at such a loss that some of the pro-gunners are resisting and criticizing the CDC research?

>As for the CDC, if an organization is capable of providing useful data,

It's designed to research about diseases and medical things. There are established agencies that have a better handle on these facts. 

>it should not only be allowed to but encouraged to.

The issue some people have is having the CDC research the issue won't provide as accurate data, skewing what's true or not.

>There is no good reason why any debate should refuse data.

Sure there is. If a debate comes across biased information that doesn't portray the whole truth, it should be refused. Yet both sides designate what's good or not from bias as well. Some anti-gunners don't want any data that portrays gun ownership as a good thing, some pro-gunners don't want any from the other side. The gap of contrarianism expands.",-3,0,1444596147,1444718130

Vigilantism is one thing, because he took it upon himself to uphold the law because there were no police there at that moment, but vigilante justice is not what this is.

Vigilante justice is extrajudicial *punishment* motivated by dissatisfaction of the law. See - Wild West gunfights and Southern lynchings.

He did not shoot on the guy, he did not hurt the guy at all, he only produced his weapon to get the guy to stop. Because that weapon was a gun, the guy stopped running.

>Did he really intend to shoot the guy in the back for an automobile collision if didn't stop running?

I can't speak for the guy but just reading the article tells me he had no intent to hurt anybody.

>Was he trained enough to be aware of who might be in the line of fire, or would he kill an innocent person like the guy who shot the carjacking victim in the head?

That's literally the first rule of handling a gun, always being aware of where it's pointing. The second is keeping your finger off the trigger until you're prepared to shoot at whatever you are pointing at. You can point a gun without having your finger on the trigger.

Considering this happened in Oregon, and we can surmise Dornon had a CCW license, he must:
>Demonstrate competence with a handgun by any one of the following means:

>Completion of any hunter education or hunter safety course approved by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife or a similar agency of another state if handgun safety was a component of the course;

>Completion of any National Rifle Association firearms safety or training course if handgun safety was a component of the course;
Completion of any firearms safety or training course or class available to the general public offered by law enforcement, community college, or private or public institution or organization or firearms training school utilizing instructors certified by the National Rifle Association or a law enforcement agency if handgun safety was a component of the course;

>Completion of any law enforcement firearms safety or training course or class offered for security guards, investigators, reserve law enforcement officers or any other law enforcement officers if handgun safety was a component of the course;

>Presents evidence of equivalent experience with a handgun through participation in organized shooting competition or military service;

>Is licensed or has been licensed to carry a firearm in this state, unless the license has been revoked; or

>Completion of any firearms training or safety course or class conducted by a firearms instructor certified by a law enforcement agency or the National Rifle Association if handgun safety was a component of the course.

Those are the requirements for an Oregon CCW license, which include extensive training with a handgun.

>Edit to add: note that nobody's life was in danger.

No, but he was in the place and time to keep the driver from running away, he saved the police a lot of time in tracking him down, and assuring the victims would be able to pursue justice in the courts. The same reasoning behind a police officer producing their weapon, it was to uphold the law, not to exact justice.

Edit: Wanted to clarify that these were the requirements for an Oregon license, not just ""Those are the requirements for a CCW license"" like I originally wrote.",2,0,1444593723,1444718130
