Like with the bones and all the geographic shit in place similar to the way we find it today.... I'm not saying that's the case, but it might be what some believe.  Either way it doesn't seem to me to be a particularly pressing area of concern for the president.

>Do you honestly think that these German people hear that ""Hundreds of thousands of financial migrants will be arriving in Germany. They have limited to no skills, believe in sexist ideologies and disagree with the established freedoms that you fought so hard for. They will require you to pay for them.""
Germans:""Oh that is fine......We should help people in need""
Germans:""Wait!....what colour is their skin?....brown?! NOT IN MY COUNTRY!""
That is basically what you are saying. All of the negatives that come along with these people mean nothing, Germans have an issue with them only because of the colour of their skin.
