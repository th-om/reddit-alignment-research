... You do realize that ""Good guy with a gun"" applies to cops as well as concealed-carriers, right?

>One civilian has killed the gunman after he slaughtered students, nothing else.

Are you trying to imply that cops are members of the military? I thought American ""liberals"" were against the militarization of the police. =3",2,0,1444668642,1444719857

I live in Houston, Texas.

There are 5 gun ranges within 20 miles of my house that will rent machine guns, including one with an MG-42. 

>First and foremost being that you can't walk into a gun store or pawn shop, plop down $500 on the counter and walk out with a full-auto thompson or MG-42.

Maybe not walk out with it, but they'll give you a Thompson, enough ammo to run it for a few minutes, and all-day access to a lane at the gun range for $500. 

>Reasonable restrictions don't exist for the weapons referred to as ""assault weapons,"" or huntingt rifles, or handguns, or any other firearm which serves the purpose of killing shit, regardless of what totally imagined reason someone has for believing they absolutely have to be able to buy any kind of gun without any waiting period at all. It needs to be harder for people to get guns. 

I disagree. What makes you believe that the existing restrictions on firearms aren't reasonable?

>Rather than bitching about the fact that other people are getting fed up with the situation and are going to get something done about it whether the 2nd amendment nutjob crowd in this country likes it or not.

But that's illegal! /s

Seriously though. Don't Charlie Hebdo and the French Train Attack that those American GIs foiled disprove that point? 

We're not talking about allowing terrorists to own automatic weapons anyway, that's already against the law and they seem to get ahold of them regardless. 

We're talking about the 99.98% of gun-owners who aren't terrorists or gang members or what-have-you that would be willing to jump through the usual hoops to own a gun, but not our current system whereby you have to register, pass a thorough FBI background check, pay $200, and then wait six months to a year for processing for the chance to buy a 20+ year old machine gun whose price is consequently one or two orders of magnitude greater than manufacturer suggested retail value.

Heh, not if you believe some of the more fervent gun control campaigners =3

Seriously though, gun violence is totally an issue, but when you could save more lives with the mildest of mandatory exercise programs than you'd ever save by waving a magic wand and wishing away all the guns forever, then wasting all this political capital on gun control is probably not the best use of our time. 

>He hasn't even made a concrete policy statement since this shooting I think, how can you take issue with his plan when there isn't one?

Obama's been vocally supporting Australia's gun control policies in his speeches a lot lately. Even if he doesn't push for a full ban on all handguns and semi-automatic longarms as they did, nothing else the Democrats are likely to propose would be a better option than Republican Tom Coburn's universal gun control proposal which Harry Reid kept off the table back in 2013. 

If there was a proposal available for review, you could bet your bottom dollar I'd be here telling you exactly why it is or isn't a good idea based on it's own merits.",1,0,1444609631,1444719857
