cvwsqwx,0,t1_cvwa4wh,zascar,"Thanks, see the thing is I do a bit of touring, and I swore I'd never have another naked bike - I hear the hypermotard is a great bike - absolutely lounatic licence loser - but doing long distances on motorways at high speeds, not the best bike for that really is it?",0,0,1444647441,1444716808
cvvzfk0,0,t1_cvvyyxz,zascar,"Thanks, good to know as this was my fear... Yes I love the 848 I would definitely consider it, but they are more expensive. A guy I know had one and said the leg and ass burning from the 848 was even worse than the 749!

Beauty always comes with a price!",1,0,1444585435,1444716808
cvvsoio,0,t1_cvvrj6e,zascar,"Thanks for the feedback - that's great. I had a 749 and it used to roast the absolute ass off me! Horrible sometimes! Where I live its not often hot (+20c) but when it is, its torture. I guess its the same on the 1098?

I hear they are grabby and grumpy but someone told me that a power commander can sort it right out is that true?

Ideally I'd buy a second smaller bike for commuting and use the 1098 for pleasure, but those spins are few and far between these days - the battery would die between rides (No power outlet where I keep it)

I like the low end torque alright and I know what you mean about the fireblade brakes!",1,0,1444572453,1444716808
