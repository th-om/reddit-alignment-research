I'll pick on one non major that Sanders likes to mention: college affordability. I'll completely agree with Sanders that college is becoming unaffordable, especially for 2nd quartile income Americans.

However, focusing on subsidizing the cost is completely naive and ignores the root cause of the problem: the higher education bubble, caused by easy money backed by the federal government.

So what do about that is a debate worth having, but pouring more federal money into the system is akin to dousing a tire fire with gasoline.

And that's basically my issue with him, is that he focuses on creating specific outcomes without addressing or perhaps even understanding the complex sociologic and economic processes that cause those outcomes.",1,1,1444704528,1444722915

I think it also showed a lot of Nolan's warts as a moviemaker (stuffy dialogue, thin characters, direct exposition, and more complicated than necessary plot).",0,0,1444699193,1444722915

Half of what the two color guys say is incoherent, they take stands on the dumbest points, and they can't even put sentences together without choking on them.
