You are however, entitled to the basic opportunities to make it for yourself. Part of that includes equal protection under the law, a fundamental concept at least here in the US. Something that we Americans view as critical to a proper capitalist system: the idea that it doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, what religion you practice, etc., so long as you work you can find success. Discriminating against people based upon inherent traits such as race, gender, or sexuality goes against that ideal.

So again, why shouldn't society stop discriminating, rather than forcing those who are persecuted to flee somewhere (which is not realistic for most)? You have this warped since of what it takes to just up and move internationally--the fact is that most people cannot just up and leave, whether that be for financial, familial, or cultural reasons.

Now, depending on the proceedings and certain results, those judgments may not be legally binding (such as denial of due process or certain rights which are not waivable). Also none of this points to them wishing to submit non-Muslims to these courts (which further supports the ""mediator"" analogy).

Good to know you have no interest in actual, honest discussion.

And you don't want to acknowledge that it's **not** as ""obvious"" as you claim, and is actually far more complicated of a topic.

> You continue to point out that less than 10% of the muslim world dustributed in dilute quantities is somehow an example of islamic acceptance.

Your own fucking source shows that the views you decry as so abhorrent are actually held by a minority of Muslims, worldwide. Even by region, they're mostly minority views. And I keep pointing towards American Muslims because that the most relevant group to the OP issue to begin with. Ben Carson (and yourself presumably) believe that a Muslim would be incompatible to hold the office of the Presidency. Well, given that we're not going to elect some random Muslim from Iraq, the obviously relevant group would be American Muslims. And lo and behold, we don't find radicalism rampant among American Muslims. In fact, the studies show that American Muslims are among the best integrated minority group in the nation. The studies show that they don't believe that Sharia should be made official or that it should be binding against non-Muslims. They don't indicate that they would deny women, homosexuals, or non-Muslims of the constitutional rights should they gain office. They certainly don't show that they would enforce their religious beliefs against others any more so than evangelical Christians have.

> You pointed to Egypt as some beacon of hope. What tge fuck?

I agree. What the fuck? Because **that's not what I have done in the slightest**. I've pointed to countries like Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia, Malaysia, Lebanon, etc. as examples of somewhat secularized Muslim-majority nations, where the rights of non-Muslims are still recognized, where women are not persecuted by the state (a fashion like Saudi Arabia--which every anti-Muslim likes to point to as the archetype of Muslim society), and where the people have been yearning for democratic government. Yet you ignore these millions of Muslims and focus on the minority instead, living in hateful ignorance and looking only at data that confirms your bias.

> Dude. Finish high school and live a little more. And check your glasses. And maybe read the Koran for yourself.

Very mature. Nevermind that I have graduated high school. I got my Bachelor's Degree in History, while also taking a number of courses in comparative religion, politics, and even a couple focused on Islam. I've actually been to Egypt for a month, during the Egyptian presidential election in 2012. I've actually had talks with ordinary Muslims, both here and abroad. I've studied the geopolitical history of the Middle East. That's why I hold the position that I do.

Now, do I agree with Islam? No. I'm actually an atheist. I'd prefer all religion to be removed from our political process. But I will not support prejudice against Muslims in general, especially when it's based on an obsessive, ignorant hatred and dismissal of any evidence that contradicts your view of Muslims.

Try stepping away from Fox News and your right-wing ""news"" sites that only portray the darkest parts of the Muslim world. Go out and talk to a Muslim. Actually study the history of the Middle East. Step out of your hateful bubble and educate yourself.",1,0,1444502915,1444719525

> An extremely small sect. Orthodox christians. And last time I checked, they dont take a woman not doing that to be inviting rape.

Mormons, far-right evangelicals, Amish, Mennonite, etc. And you clearly haven't ever discussed the issue of rape with any of these individuals--how often do you hear the rhetoric of ""well if she wasn't dressed so slutty, maybe she wouldn't have been raped?""

> No. They arent. They cant drive in some countries. They cant go to school past a young age in most. They cannot own property or inheret wealth from their families. They cannot divorce.

They are stoned or acid splashed for infidelity but men? Who cares!? Allah put women on earth to be harvested like fields according to Mohammad. Are you just completely ignorant? Do you actually know anything about the islamic world? Apparently not.

This does not happen in the majority of Muslim-majority countries. It's mostly tied to third world nations that are rife with poverty and suffer from long-lasting practices that again date back pre-Islam. 

> Oh so I guess an incredibly small minority of people priveleged enough to come here are representative of the other 99% of Islam right? Strength in numbers is what you have to keep in mind. The only reason they dont cause problems for the US is because they lack the numbers. Look at what hapoens in Brighton, Luton, Leicester and Manchester Gorton for examples of what haooens when the numbers reach critical mass in one place. They cordon themselves off and deintegrate. Every damn time.

So then why haven't we seen the millions of Muslims in the U.S. do the same (ignoring that I cited the debunking of the so-called ""no-go"" zones anyways)? Why don't we see these sorts of issues in the U.S. at all? You do realize that there are studies that show that Muslim immigrants are actually among the best immigrant groups in terms of integration in the U.S.? Mostly because the majority of those that immigrate to the U.S. are fairly wealthy or educated. Have you ever actually talked to a Muslim-American?

> It means nothing to western culture. I dont care what sharia says, because it doesnt say anything I agree with at all or any westerner agrees with. At all.

You don't care what it says....because you disagree with what it says......I don't....I mean come on dude. Are you even trying at this point? No Westerner agrees with anything in Sharia? Again, the millions of Muslim-Americans (who are not all first-generation immigrants, and even include American converts) don't count?

> Yes. Necessarily. And since 1.5 billion people follow it, it is a problem. And christianity has waaaaaaaaaay less of those problems. Are you fucking blind?

Again, if you look at the actual research regarding what those 1.5 billion Muslims actually believe, you'll see that it's not so black-and-white. That there is a majority of Muslims who follow compatible beliefs, who don't believe that Sharia should be instituted against non-Muslims, who don't believe in acts of terrorism, who don't believe in violence against non-Muslims, etc. You're argument just does not match the data, and is based solely on your reactionary, ignorant view of all Muslims.

> Less than 1% of muslims in a culture of 310 non muslims is not an example of islamic tolerance and assimilation. Do you understand basic statistics?

Yes it would be. It shows that it is possible for Muslims to be integrated into a Western, secular nation, without mass violence. Do you understand basic common sense?

>Go live in any middle eastern country with your family and let me know how accepting they are.

It would depend on the nation and time period. It's a bit unfair to make that comparison now because much of the Middle East is currently going through civil wars of some variety (following the Arab Spring). Also, much of the Middle East suffers from generational poverty and oppressive dictatorial regimes (which are not actually connected to Islam, but rather Western political strategies during and following the age of colonialism). But I could point to similarly situated, Christian-majority nations where it would be just as dangerous for an American family to live. Look at Central Africa, where the Lord's Resistance Army (a Christian terrorist organization) has brutalized the countryside for years. Look at Eastern Europe, where violence against gays has been systematic, and Christian majorities have tried to wipe out Muslim minorities. Look at much of Latin America, where well over a century of U.S. meddling has caused massive instability and poverty. These aren't Christian or Muslim problems--these are geopolitical problems.

But you can only see the wrong in Muslims. You are a byproduct of leaders demonizing the ""Other"" as a scapegoat, while blinding you to the actual causes of these issues. A system that likes to paint the world into nice little categories of ""us v. them"" and discourages actually meeting/talking with/understanding the point of view of the other side. I suggest you go out. Meet or talk with a Muslim-American. Learn what they actually think/believe. Read up on the actual histories of these regions and religion. Look at the history of the West as a comparison too, and learn about how the two have interconnected over the years. You'll find that the black-and-white world you've been thought to see doesn't actually exist, and that the reality is far more complicated than you believe.",1,0,1444490597,1444719525
cvutpnj,0,t1_cvu8brg,cjdeist92,"> I think the fact that secular government exists in most of the christian world shows that christians in office are not the problem.

Except that Christians still try to legislate Christian doctrine onto non-Christians. Hell, look at the Kim Davis case--here was a Christian clerk actively denying same-sex couples their constitutional rights because of her Christian beliefs. It's virtually required for a presidential candidate to be a Christian in order to be elected in the U.S., simply because so many American Christians consider it to be a necessary trait for a president (even though it says nothing about the candidate's ability to actually govern).

So again, I'd say that the Western world has secular governments **in spite** of Christianity, not **because** of Christianity.

> Every secular government in the west was created by christians who got sick of monarchies and the Vatican. It wasnt created by athiests. Or any other religion for that matter. It is not accurate at all to say that.

Um..not true. Secularism came from a mix of sectarian minorities and non-Christians who saw the dangers of state religions. The Founding Fathers were a mix of Protestants, non-denominational deists, and even a few atheists. All of whom decided that it shouldn't matter what religion someone was, so long as they were qualified to properly govern. And again, other Christians fought against this principle, believing that Christianity necessarily had to be a part of any sort of ""moral"" government. Again, secular government was created despite the best efforts of most Christians.

> It had everything to do with christianity. It was modeled on ancient governments but it was always motivated by disagreement between christian pooulations and christian oligarchs.

But was not inspired by any Christian doctrine. There is no Christian doctrine that supports secularism. If anything, Christianity teaches the opposite. But yes, commoners were tired of their governments/rulers using religion as a means of control, so they moved towards a system that held no religion in control. Again, closer following the principles and systems of the Ancient Greek and Romans, rather than any sort of Christian teaching.

> Turkey: ruled by a crazy islamist with 8% of the worlds islamic population constantly under threat of economic and social collapse. If they werent an EFTA member state they would be fucked like Syria.

Turkey still practices at least a form of secularism. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism_in_Turkey#Impact_on_society). Now, is Turkey the most stable country? No. It's right now caught in the crossroads as millions of refugees flee from the civil war in Syria, causing much of its instability.

> Indonesia and Malaysia; Sharia law is largely implemented in these societies. Just because the women arent forced to wear hijabs or burkas in every family doesnt mean it is by any means a secular nation. Try living there with your western wife. Ill bet you will have a blast.

Indonesia does not have state Sharia law. There is one province that has a more radical version of Sharia instituted, but the nation as a whole does not. Malaysia is similar in this regard. Can you cite some examples of persecution of Westerners there, which was not also condemned and prosecuted by the government?

> Egypt; worst female genital mutilation problem in the world. Constantly under threat of collapse. Already collapsed in the last 5 years.

Regarding the female genital mutilation, this appears to have been an Egyptian practice since long before Islam was introduced, dating back to Ancient Egypt. See [here](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/25/middleeast/egypt-female-genital-mutilation/). Does that excuse it? Of course not. But that does not make it a descriptor of Islam as a whole. Regarding it's instability, a large part of that is because they have been working to remove a century long system of military dictatorship, which is never an easy process. These are Egyptians, Muslim, Christian, and even Jewish and atheist alike, fighting for a democratic system of government. But yeah, how could Muslims ever live in a Western democracy...../s

> Western Europe? What about British muslim communities that have cordoned themselves off and settle disputes in sharia courts? What about the honor killings that occur every year in those separated communities. People living under secular governments completely disrespecting the rights afforded by those governments by denouncing female freedom and maintaining religious integrity to the point that Europe doesnt know what to do about it for fear of being called racist.

Ugh..see [here](http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/nogozones.asp) regarding ""no-go"" zones (or lack thereof). Honor killings are an issue that the various European governments are looking to resolve. These seem to mostly be limited to North African immigrants, where honor killings again pre-date Islam as a part of the culture. 

> I prefer to look at the 90% of the muslim world that lives in a way that makes humanism and tolerance impossible. 

Is that the Muslims' fault or their governments? Because note that the majority of those countries live under a form of right-wing dictatorships that are naturally oppressive anyways. And I would again point to things like the Arab Spring or even the Syrian Civil War as examples that show Muslims desiring democratic governments. I was in Egypt during their presidential election back in 2012. The atmosphere at the time was amazing. Nearly every Egyptian I met, regardless of religion, were immensely excited at the prospect of actually getting to choose their next leader. Were there disagreements over who to vote for? Of course. We have the same here. But they were all genuinely thrilled at the prospect of democracy.

> The fact that you think Egypt and Indonesia and Malaysia are beacons of moderate secular governments and populations is evidence you have zero idea what you are talking about besides the tylical liberal assembly line arguments that cannot stand up to scrutiny.

Where did I say that they were the ""beacons of moderate secular government""? I said they were examples of secular governments in Muslim-majority countries. Do they have problems? Of course. But they at least demonstrate that it's possible for Muslims to live in a secular society.

> You should take a look that that Pew research I posted. You might learn something.

I've actually studied this research before, back during undergrad when I took multiple courses in comparative religion and specifically modern Islam. You know what that poll shows? It's shows wide variance in not only whether Sharia should be official state law, but whether it should apply to non-Muslims and what parts of Sharia should actually be implemented. It shows that the majority of Muslims support various women's rights (such as a right to divorce, to inherit wealth/property, to work, to drive, etc.). It shows that the majority of Muslims denounce acts of terrorism, such as suicide bombings (which makes sense, as Muslims are far more often to be the victims of such attacks, since terrorism is predominately politically motivated). Hell, it even shows that a majority of Muslims don't believe there to be a serious tension between Muslims and non-Muslims.

Now what would be *really* interesting would be to compare these results with a poll of worldwide Christians. I think you would be surprised at the results.",2,0,1444490577,1444719525
