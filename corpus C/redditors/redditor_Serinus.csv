In the 80s and early 90s, the prevailing culture was that you could drive home buzzed.  Being able to drive home was showing you could handle your alcohol, and a thing to be respected (by idiots, but still).

Kind of how fraternity hazing is still cool among frat guys.  When you take a step back it's easy to see that it (can be) fucked up. While you're in that environment, the prevailing culture is that the farther you can go the more awesome your fraternity is  And it's hard to be the lame dude that says, ""not cool, guys"".",6,0,1444689807,1444720909

cvxb3h1,0,t1_cvx5zzd,Serinus,"Since when have Republicans *actually* been fiscally responsible?

~~Schwarzenegger, maybe?~~ nope.  But he's hardly your standard Republican.

They say they are, sure, but they never act on it.  They cut taxes on the wealthy and corporations.  They cut spending in things they don't like, such as education.  But their budgets always end up more unbalanced than any democrat would do.

Look at the shit Scott Walker keeps trying.  Selling off state owned assets for pennies on the dollar, and to buy the product back from those utilities.  How is that fiscally responsible?

The Republican version of ""fiscal responsibility"" is to sell your toothbrush and toothpaste, realize profits for a year until you need major dental work that costs a shitton, and then rent back that toothbrush and toothpaste you sold from a private company for more than it would cost you to own them.",29,0,1444681030,1444720909

Teams don't have the coordination to use two upgraded sweepers to clear an entire area of wards, and then use that lack of vision as a team to bait properly.  More wards is just better than blue... if you actually place them.",1,0,1444678435,1444720909

cvx1lzk,0,t1_cvdwjnc,Serinus,"/u/AmbientChaos don't be afraid of ranked.

You can play 1000 normal games and then do you placements and get placed directly into gold 3.

You can jump into ranked immediately and get placed into bronze 3, play 1000 ranked games, and end up gold 1.

Either way you play 1000 games and end up at about the same place.  It's just a matter of if you want to track your progress or not.  Some people don't want to admit they were ever bronze, but we all start somewhere.  Generally it's easier to improve with stat tracking and feedback.

If you're not yet level 30, I can almost guarantee you're worse than the average player.  That's okay. Accept that and improve.",1,0,1444667210,1444720909
