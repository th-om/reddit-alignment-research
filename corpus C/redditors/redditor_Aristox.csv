> First, it's unclear that believers in objective morality base their morality on ""logic and reason"", since presumably moral intuitions or emotions are going to have to do some grounding work.

I agree that believing in objective morality doesn't guarantee basing morality on reason, but this wasn't actually a claim I made :)

>Second, it's unclear that moral relativists aren't basing their morality in reason, since (given a set of social starting-points) they might have a quite worked-out moral system.

I agree that moral relativists may employ reason *along the way*, but I think the rejection of the reality of objective morality means they have no ""control"" to measure their own whims against, and no logically valid foundation for any of the later reasoning they might do along the way. Im not claiming they are necessarily neglecting reason at all stages and in all cases, just that their reasoning has no valid foundation, thereby rendering it untrustworthy.

>Third, it's inaccurate to say that the moral relativist can change their mind ""on a whim"", since for the relativist morality is going to depend on some moral community, not the mind of one individual.

It isn't clear from the OP that OP takes this stance. But even if they do, it is daily possible to switch moral communities on a whim.

>Fourth, even if the relativist thinks that morality is indexed to their mind alone, they might still have extremely stable preferences and inclinations, including a preference for being a moral person.

Yeah, I referred to this in my original comment.

>Fifth, a believer in objective morality might also change their mind on a whim and decide to frame you for a crime (or something), since psychological quirks aren't unique to moral relativists.

Granted, but that doesn't make moral relativists any more trustworthy.

> I think it offers an easy way out for the naive moral relativist - they can just say (justifiably!) that they know they're trustworthy, so your criticism doesn't apply to them.

My point wasn't that a person should just fear *being* untrustworthy, in itself, but rather that a person should regret and wish to avoid *being perceived* by others in their community as untrustworthy. That is something that can't be mitigated by simply asserting they know they actually are trustworthy.",1,0,1444399751,1444725665
