cvnt9uc,0,t1_cvnrxq1,DannyOakley,"No one is saying that a rifle is less effective than a pistol. What I am saying is that banning the types of weapons that are least likely to be used in the commission of a crime is unlikely to have any effect on violence and any legislation based on the least common type of gun violence (mass shootings) is misguided at best.

Depending on which study you look at, the most popular firearm used by criminals is either a .38 revolver or a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol. Speaking strictly in terms of homicides, rifles only account for 2-3% of murders in the US. [In fact, you're more likely to be stabbed, bludgeoned, or beaten to death than killed be a rifle of any kind.](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2009-2013.xls)",1,0,1443971670,1444720240
cvn9o5p,0,t1_cvmxnk4,DannyOakley,">I can say this with certainty: without easy access to guns, there would be far fewer violent deaths in America, for the simple fact that violently killing someone would be far harder to do.

Again, still not getting to the root of the issue as I've mentioned in other comments. If you put a mentally deranged person in a strait jacket and a padded room they'll no longer be a danger to themselves or others, but it still doesn't resolve the fact that they're mentally deranged.

I'm all for preventing these people from getting a gun legally, but it still concerns me that there are pasty internet trolls out there who would kill a dozen people and take their own life for no particular reason. These are the things on which I would much rather focus our time, energy, and resources.

It also doesn't address the much larger source gun violence which is street crime. The streets are flooded with millions of illegal guns and criminals don't tend to abide by gun control regulations. The people shooting it out in my neighborhood aren't concerned about Massachusetts' assault weapon ban or magazine capacity limits. They don't worry about crossing state lines or safe storage laws. Those are things that only effect me as a licensed and law abiding gun owner.",1,0,1443917012,1444720240
cvmwmdz,0,t1_cvmui75,DannyOakley,">No, but it does make it easier for violent people to kill.

I don't entirely disagree, though as I've already mentioned there are plenty of other ways to inflict harm on people.

>So, case in point, the basement-dwelling loner who wants to get off 4chan and make his mark on the world would not have the strength or fortitude to beat or knife 10 people to death. But with a handful of guns, he can do it quite easily.

Keep in mind that Elliot Rogers stabbed three people to death before he even started shooting. And while the Boston bombers only killed three people at the marathon finish line, there were also dozens of people who ended that day with fewer limbs than they woke up with. You can't say with any certainty that the shooter in OR wouldn't have harmed just as many people through any other method.

>The violent nature is present with or without a gun. The gun just makes it far easier to carry out.

Which is why I support any reasonable measure that would prevent these people from accessing firearms and stop these acts of violence before they occur. What I do not support is any type of legislation that would make it prohibitively difficult for a sane law abiding citizen to own firearms for recreation and self defense while having no effect on violent crime.

I'm not a conservative republican, I don't support the NRA, and I don't believe anything I've said thus far can be considered cheering anyone from the sidelines. I've been very clear as far as what I think will and will not be effective at reducing violent crime in the US.

>People propose things like background checks, and magazine limits, and limits on rifles that can fire rifle grenades or have bayonet lugs because they live in the real world and that's the only thing they can do.
And here you are on the sidelines cheering the pro gun people who are the roadblock that prevent any more effective gun legislation while simultaneously and hypocritically decry the fact that pro gun control people don't put forward laws that have absolutely no chance of success.

So we agree that the proposals above would have little to no impact on gun violence but are being put forward just so people can feel like something is being done. You've yet to cite any specific gun control proposals that you believe would make a difference but have been rejected.

>So now you have people unwilling to accept any gun control criticizing pro gun control people for not doing more because the pro gun control people couldn't do more.

This sentence is confusing and I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at.

>Look at the UK. Look at japan. They have gun control. It works. You absolutely cannot argue for one second that gun control is impossible. 

Context is important. At no point in the history of these countries has the rate of firearm ownership been anywhere near as high as it currently is in America. With enough guns to arm all 300,000,000 plus people in the United States, assuming that we can apply the same gun control measures as other countries and solve the problem is ignoring the reality we face. This is not even taking into account the differences in geography, ethnic diversity, levels of poverty, and standards of education.

>Let's say that tomorrow republicans come to the table willing to strike some kind of reasonable deal that would reverse half a century of continually worsening mental health care in the US and bring about modern, high quality, accessible mental health care? That would be great, but it still wouldn't address the gun problem.

But it would address the problem at the root which is what I've been getting at this whole time. Simply preventing a violent person from accessing a gun will not prevent them from committing acts of violence.

>Do you have any shame? Do you have a single shred of shame? Any tiny sliver of shame? Do you, /u/dannyoakley have the smallest measureable amount of shame at all?

cvmtx91,0,t1_cvmsxja,DannyOakley,"Increased access to guns doesn't just magically make people more violent. I can concede that the availability of guns in America is a factor as far as *how* these acts are committed, but it still doesn't get to the root of *why*. This is what I meant as far as not being able to pin down the complicated reasons why people commit these acts of violence regardless of the how they commit them.

I'm from Boston where all it took was two angry kids with homemade pressure cooker bombs to bring my city to it's knees. I'm not nearly as concerned with the how as I am with the why, because I believe that focusing on the why gives us the best chance of preventing similar incidents in the future.",3,0,1443888964,1444720240

I'm all for making sure people can handle the responsibility of owning a firearm and that they have no previous criminal record or history of mental illness, but to dig so deeply into someone's private life is what I would consider a huge violation of my rights and it would (thankfully) never fly in the US.

As I stated above, a better system of mental healthcare in the US might help to prevent acts like this in the future but there are most certainly a number of cultural elements at play that I admit I can't quite put my finger on.

>In that light it sounds fatalistic to just shrug and say ""people will kill people, whaddya going to do?"" It's like you're promoting apathy in a context where it's obvious we could do better, as evidenced by every other comparable nation.

I'm not so callous as to dismiss these lost lives as ""well waddya gonna do"", but it's important to understand that events like this represent a minute fraction of gun violence and that these indiscriminate acts are incredibly difficult to predict and prevent because they *are* almost entirely random. If we truly want to reduce the levels of gun violence (and violence in general) we need to focus on street level crime in the inner cities across the country, and I say this as someone who currently lives in one of those areas.

>I can't accept the idea we're supposed to do nothing on this singular outstanding blot on life in the US, and instead pour our dollars into areas where we don't have nearly as much reason to believe there is room for improvement.

Well, you're being extremely generous by claiming that gun violence is the *singular* outstanding blot on life in the US. But I'm not saying we should do nothing; if you go back to my original comment above, I listed a few things which I believe would reduce the levels of violence down to comparable levels as other developed nations. I just don't believe anything that has been proposed in the wake of these tragedies would have measurable effect on violence of any kind.",7,0,1443844344,1444720240
