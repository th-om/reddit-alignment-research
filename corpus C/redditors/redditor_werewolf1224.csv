cvcrnyl,1,t3_3m6yg9,werewolf1224,"He does make a good point when he mentions the revolving door and how regulators are bought by the biggest corporations or lobbying firms. Corporations are then able to pay to get the rules changed to give them an advantage.

Also, communism was seen as a bad thing for so many years because of oppressive regimes that claimed to be communist. You can argue that they weren't really communist, but people saw the negative effects of governments taking control of the economy. I don't know why so many people think that the answer to every problem is less capitalism and more socialism.

I like this article explaining the different definitions. Sanders from my point of view just seems like a guy who couldn't care less about the debt or deficit spending.
