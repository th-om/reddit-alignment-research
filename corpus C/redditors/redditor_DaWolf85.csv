cvx53u0,0,t1_cvx2xmk,DaWolf85,"The whole item is generally assumed to be contaminated once it's touched because we do not know how fast the bacteria will spread - it varies by surface, environment, the dirtiness of the person's hand, etc. Sometimes this means the statement isn't actually true, it's a blanket statement and a safety margin. However it is sometimes true, which is the same thing if you're going for 100% effectiveness like food safety tries to.

And it really doesn't matter whether it takes time for the bacteria to multiply and travel. Someone stacked those cups. That likely happened hours ago, and that's plenty of time for bacteria to get everywhere they can.

If the cups are stored properly, your server has clean hands and generally practices good food safety, there really is not anything special to worry about when they touch the rim of your cup. If there was a possibility of you getting sick from it then that possibility existed anyway.",3,0,1444672426,1444729689
cvx0yhg,0,t1_cvwu6sq,DaWolf85,"It's because this is the best way to carry a very full drink without spilling it. The higher you hold it, the lower the center of gravity is relative to your hand, and therefore the less it wants to move around and spill stuff everywhere.

And also because technically it doesn't matter where you touch it, once you touch it the whole thing should be assumed to be contaminated. The actually important things for food safety are hand hygiene and not working while sick.",2,0,1444666175,1444729689
