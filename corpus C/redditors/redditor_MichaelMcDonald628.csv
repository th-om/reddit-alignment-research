cvjsg05,0,t1_cvjpqpd,MichaelMcDonald628,"Seriously? He spends 98% of the time advocating for issues such as poverty and immigration, but because he has a 15 minute, non-publicized meeting with a woman who doesn't issue marriage licenses to anyone because of her beliefs, you're no longer a fan of his?

And why is it that he didn't lose fans after spending four days with Raul Castro in Cuba - a country that has zero recognition of same-sex marriages or civil unions, and has a long history of oppressing the LGBT community?",13,0,1443648997,1444724792
cvjrgo9,1,t3_3n0g9l,MichaelMcDonald628,"Were people seriously not aware that Pope Francis opposes same-sex marriage? He doesn't discuss the issue as publicly, because he'd rather keep the media's attention on more important issues, such as poverty. 

People should be neither outraged nor shocked that Pope Francis had a short, non-publicized meeting with Davis. He's a devout Catholic, after all. ",77,0,1443647501,1444724792
cvd10ym,1,t3_3m5ocm,MichaelMcDonald628,"Although he's not running, I believe Rudy Giuliani most accurately fits your description.

As for candidates who are running, pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, limited government but strong national security candidate. John Kasich maybe.    ",1,0,1443129347,1444724792

cvbxppb,1,t3_3m4jc8,MichaelMcDonald628,"From the study: ""Government agricultural policy is prominent among the many factors that shaped Syria’s vulnerability to drought. Despite growing water scarcity and frequent droughts, the government of President Hafez al-Assad (1971−2000) initiated policies to further increase agricultural production, including land redistribution and irrigation projects, quota systems, and subsidies for diesel fuel to garner the support of rural constituents.""

Tell me, what really lead to the instability of the Syria: 

1. The 0.85ºC temperature increase from 1880 to 2012, which increased the statistical probability of a drought occurring in Syria.

2. A corrupt, totalitarian government, whose leaders were more interested in enriching themselves than in allocating their scarce resources in such a way that would benefit the people.   ",2,0,1443049078,1444724792
cvbuhr9,0,t1_cvbtmzt,MichaelMcDonald628,"Although I agree that polls are fairly meaningless this far from the primary elections, technically speaking Trump could win a handful of states with only 30-35% in the polls. 

If there are 5 or 6 candidates in one of these primaries, and Trump wins 35% of the votes, the other 65% could be split evenly amongst the other 5 candidates, making Trump the candidate with the highest percentage.  ",1,0,1443043838,1444724792
cvbu12b,0,t1_cvbth58,MichaelMcDonald628,"I don't think there's any chance Carson wins the nomination, and his support will likely go to Fiorina. But poll-wise and favorability-wise, I believe Carson can be considered the ""front runner"" - at least right this moment. In a few weeks, however, I think Fiorina will be the new ""flavor of the month"" front runner. 

In the long run, I believe Rubio is the front runner.  At some point, you have to become a ""flavor of the month"" kind of candidate. Rubio will eventually become that, and he's got real staying power. Bush, on the other hand, will never be a ""flavor of the month"" candidate, and will likely continue to see his support vanish.

cvbtdol,0,t1_cvbt2y7,MichaelMcDonald628,"Haha, I don't think Trump is the frontrunner. His favorability ratings are absolutely terrible. 
I don't believe the GOP race has a clear frontrunner.  If you combine polls (including the voters' second choice) and favorability ratings, I'd say Carson is the frontrunner.
I think you could assign Rubio the frontrunner status as well - he's rising in the polls, has good favorability ratings, and Bush supporters and endorsers will most likely jump to Rubio when they realize Bush is a much weaker candidate than Rubio. ",1,0,1443042182,1444724792
cvbson4,1,t3_3m42h4,MichaelMcDonald628,"In no way is Jeb Bush the ""front runner."" The professional pundits assigned that phrase to Bush in the Spring and Summer, but not a single poll indicates he's the front runner - or even the runner-up.

And yes, he's a very weak candidate.  ",1,0,1443041212,1444724792
cvbn6yb,1,t3_3m3idj,MichaelMcDonald628,"1. In some polls, Trump is getting approximately 20% of the black vote - a number that Republicans only dream of receiving. 
2. Trump's ""Mexican's are rapists"" comments concern nationality, not race.
3. Trump's silence over whether Obama is a Muslim concerns religion, not race. 
4. ""GOP leaders"" is an oxymoron.
