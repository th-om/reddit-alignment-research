cvwjf4f,0,t1_cvwgpf0,the_other_guy-JK,"I'd like to also note there were several instances last week against Seattle where we couldn't convert on 3rd down due to a pissed throw in a crucial stage of the drive. 

One game, but not the only time this happens. We have many areas in need of repair this year.",1,0,1444618800,1444728870
cvwj4si,0,t1_cvwi78g,the_other_guy-JK,"Putting the guy with injured ribs through another quarter and a half of a blow out is surely NOT what you are proposing, right?

Thats one reason. No sense risking (further) injury. 

Secondly, he's having a bad game. Happens. Get him out and give him some time to regroup. That's one reason to have a backup QB, no?

As for it being Dan O specifically, so what? We kept him, maybe we shouldn't have. Let's fix that ASAP if so. Regardless, I think that Stafford needs a bit of pressure to hone those parts of his game that help this team crumble at the worst of times. Since when is that a bad thing? Is his ego that fragile that we can't yank him after THREE picks? If so, then he is absolutely part of the problem with this team.",2,0,1444618287,1444728870
cvwi7mh,1,t3_3oe9og,the_other_guy-JK,"Tate, We are with you. We want to see you be successful. We've got your back.

But we aren't able to put any faith in the product this team/organization puts on the field. It is a shame that you and many others on this team are getting squandered out of successful careers because of whatever numerous factors keep us as a perennial gutter ball team.

Until that changes, we will boo when shit plays are made, when talent is wasted, when failures are repeatable.

Because you deserve better. This team fucking blows right now.
