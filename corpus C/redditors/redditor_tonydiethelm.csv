You're all still terrible people. You are sinning RIGHT HERE, with your judgments and mockery of other people, thinking you're so much better Christians than them. Your idol hung out with a whore, and you mock fellow believers and leave their side. ",0,0,1444673707,1444731624

I went with Habitat for Humanity to Mongolia, and helped build two houses. 

It was an amazing experience, and did good work in the world. People's lives were bettered. 

Although it is a Christian organization, they explicitly forbid us to evangelize, proselytize, etc, for which I was very thankful for. I would not have gone with them otherwise. 

God didn't make any changes in me, but I did have a small restoration of faith in Christianity as a force for good... I tend to think of y'all as fairly terrible people, sorry, and it was good to see a Christian group doing good for good's sake.

Faith is belief, in the absence of evidence. I don't believe in gravity. I KNOW gravity. Belief isn't required. 

I think you've been talking to some pretty dumb skeptics. Or I just didn't get it and I'm the dumb one.... :D 

I think faith is beautiful. I don't have any, but it obviously means quite a bit to those that have it. 

As for your model of the world, and faith being used to keep people down... I think your model is a bit simplistic. 

Faith HAS been used to keep people in line. The churches of various times have been some power hungry SOBs, and there's no denying they used their supposed position of authority to keep people down. There's been some fine examples of the opposite too. As for people rising up, well, you can only push a person so far... faith or no faith, an empty stomach and no hope of a better tomorrow leads to pitchforks and torches...",1,0,1444673359,1444731624

Yes. It is. What a silly question? As if you ever could be done? Each day brings a new experience, and each experience brings new context.

And... you don't worry that that it's just your own intuition? You don't worry that it's just your own prejudices?

There's a really thin line between seeing evil and speaking against it and thinking you're better or more right than others and putting them down....",2,0,1444672984,1444731624

The only way to get to heaven is to accept Jesus as your personal savior. 


Also, I see you two are doing a lot of loving of the sinner, what with your bashing other people as lukewarm, judging them, and pridefully boasting about how much better than them, how much closer to god, how much more RIGHT you two are.... 

Have fun with that...",-3,0,1444672664,1444731624

Atheist here. I guess I'm liberal too. yeah. I'm here. Booga booga booga!

So.... liberalism is unchristian like huh? Sure it is... it's not like Jesus preached peace, love, giving.... He was all about being down on the poor people, Q!@#$ then, those leeches should get jobs and pull themselves up by their bootstraps! He never would have hung out with whores or lepers! He never would have turned the other cheek! 

Let's face it, Jesus was a liberal. He might have hated the sin, but he would have loved the sinners. He'd be right at home putting flowers into gun barrels or hanging out with Occupy giving speeches against the greed of moneychangers. 

As for the people in /r/Christianity endorsing sin?

I think you're obviously self deluded.

OK. I won't. 

But, how about the very real and very important point, which you so easily skipped over? homosexuality isn't any worse a sin than lying or having lustful thoughts, and we all keep doing those things, because we're NOT perfect. You can struggle with them your whole life. You can even make some decent progress... but you'll never overcome them, because that's the human condition. 

Ask for forgiveness for your sins. You'll never overcome them. Only the salvation of Jesus Christ gets you into heaven, because you're a sinner. It doesn't matter if that sin is homosexuality or your own pride...
