Would you (or anyone else) say that BlueIris is better than iSpy? The price of BI seemed a bit high when I was considering programs to use, but if it's worth it I'm willing to pay. (Also, can you upgrade from the one-camera LE version to the multi-cam Full version? I'm probably going to upgrade to a few more cams eventually, but right now I just have one.)

One thing I noticed is that BlueIris' Android app is still being updated, whereas iSpy's hasn't been updated since 2012, which leads me to think that they're not really developing it anymore.",1,0,1444652373,1444725892

Here's a better idea: let's call it ""Explorer's Day"".
