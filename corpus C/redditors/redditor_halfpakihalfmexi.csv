Green Vegetarian Cuisine is on my list but yes it is a little out of the way. Dimassi is also great.

Today I went to Chipotle (Sage and Richmond) but the line was ridiculous so I went next door to Noodle Company and got Udon noodles w/ Tofu.

I don't know how the udon noodles fit but for sure it was vegetarian and I would recommend it to others.

I'll check out the other 3 suggestions next week. Thanks for the tips!",1,0,1444342906,1444724780

I don't know manufacturing costs but I like the bike idea for 3rd world countries or at least the country parts of those countries. A lot of people still have no light at night and use kerosine lamps. A light in a hut/shanty/home is a big deal. A charged electronic device is a big deal. If they want a major appliance then yeah they probably need to move closer to an urban area but it makes sense for a lot of other people.

That said, you say it is expensive to build and since I have no idea on that I'll have to take your word on it.",1,0,1444228348,1444724780

I feel too many people are ""yes"" because so and so said so or ""no"" because they don't like so and so who is ""yes"" on the topic. I want to make you really question what you believe whether I agree or not.

That said, maybe keep the debates to the end of the first date or second date.",2,0,1444160387,1444724780
