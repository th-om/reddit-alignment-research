If we allow the NSA to more deeply monitor citizens, we can prevent a lot of mass shootings by reviewing their browsing history, location, medical records and other data.

cvtpkf3,0,t1_cvt7f0i,the_sam_ryan,">Your argument is ""because we don't see it doesn't mean it isn't there"" has some validity at face value, but not in this case (hence my flying crocodile...). My contention on your argument is that there is sufficient factual evidence to disclaim your argument (statistics, love them or become 1 sigma).

You aren't providing them and no one has shown any. I would love to see you produce some, otherwise it seems you are making grandiose statements not based in fact.

>Please read this and tell me you aren't outraged that we are not pursuing a full investigation. On the flip side, here is the what Kansas is doing instead.

*The voting machine software used is proprietary and even the election officials are not allowed to inspect it.*

Looks like it isn't an issue because you aren't able to prove otherwise.  The statistics may look different than you are saying, but we have no evidence that it was fraud.  At least for in-person voter fraud we have caught people, there seems to be zero caught in what you claim.  

Likewise, the inability to check IDs or other safeguards at the polling place means that the only way to actually go after in-person voter fraud is when the person double votes under their own name (*voting both absentee ballot and in-person*) or votes under their own name in two different places (*double registering*).

>The best example I can think of is going hunting and hearing the bushes rustle and antlers moving, then spot a mouse and pursue it instead. By my best numbers it looks like Kansas is spending about $200,000 a person (last years value) to not find voter fraud, while also spending about money to ignore election fraud.

While cute, your example doesn't work.   

You are establishing a burden of proof on a subject that you are also actively preventing any data to be collected or proof to be researched. You are claiming your failure to measure something will result in an answer other than we do not have data on the subject because it isn't measured and you are wrong for that claim.   

The voting machine software is proprietary and can't be reviewed.  And even if it was, we can't link actual votes to actual individuals, so proving fraud would be impossible.   And even if it was possible to prove the results were different, it would be impossible to narrow it down to the individuals that committed such fraud since there is zero paper trail.   

Which is exactly like in-person fraud that isn't done by a complete moron (*voting twice under their own name and address - either by absentee and in-person or double registering*).  Currently, the only situation they can find in-person voter fraud based on voter rolls.  There is no evidence trial for in person voting - there is no camera recording you vote, no fingerprint in ink on your ballot, and no photo of the voter at the polling place next to their name to later prove or disprove, its evidence free. To the logs, there is no difference between The_Sam_Ryan voting as The_Sam_Ryan or /u/Weaselbane voting as The_Sam_Ryan. The logs do show that there was a vote under that name, but that's it.

cvtou6l,0,t1_cvt1hfv,the_sam_ryan,">I think that the constitutional right to vote is, no exaggeration, the foundation of our democracy. So any limitations on that right need to be very narrow.

The constitution doesn't apply to how we can organize voting.  In fact, in the beginning it was limited to land owning males.   

Within the last hundred years, improvements have been made that all have been protested like this - voter registration, confirmation of address, and confirmation of status (if dead or alive). This is next logical step.

>I used Texas as an example because of the court case, but it's also one of the most restrictive voter ID laws in the country, and most other states with these laws do allow student IDs

Your source that you linked to does not say that. 

>If the point were really to corroborate the name and the face, then student IDs and Memphis library cards[2] should be enough.

The point is to confirm the correct person is voting.   Much like how some states had different standards for years on if they confirmed the person that was registering was dead or alive, there are some states with currently low standards.

>Also - voter fraud is also a felony

One that has zero teeth in any sense. 

There is no check if you are the person you claim to be and no evidence to identify you later if you aren't.  Look at who is caught for voter fraud - people that moronically vote multiple times under their own name or people that vote multiple times with absentee ballots, that's it.  People may say ""But they have to sign next to their name!"", which does nothing.  With just a forged signature of someone else and no other data, what do you think the odds are that it goes anywhere?  ",1,0,1444399786,1444717822
cvsycy5,0,t1_cvsxhnr,the_sam_ryan,"Yeah, both our situations sucked.  I hope that yours is resolved and cleared so you can vote in the primary and general.

I hate how screwed up the system is.  Its riddled with errors and zero safeguards.   I can only imagine how frustrating it was to you to get that letter and realize it was that the counties didn't update their records properly.   

There was no one else with my name on the voter roll there and no one of my gender with my last name.   I firmly believe it was intentional, because it was apparently one of the first votes there when they opened.

cvsxylf,0,t1_cvrrfpv,the_sam_ryan,">Universities/colleges do probably one of the most thorough background checks that a person will ever experience in their life.

No. This just isn't true nor does it apply to the ID if it is.  

>You have to provide more records and proof of ID than to get a driver's license (SS# for the student and parents, ID of the student, medical records, educational records, references, etc). If it's a public university, where the majority of students tend to get their higher educations, those IDs are issued by the state.

All of which is cute, but doesn't apply to the discussion.

The ID should be standardized with anti-counterfeiting features.  It should be able to be scanned by a LEO instantly to verify the individual and should have the physical attributes of the individual to confirm.   A student ID has none of those features.  

>So, given this information, why would non-standard IDs like firearm IDs take precedence over a student ID?

I have no clue why you said this.  A firearm ID is standardized by the state and contains all the features described above.
