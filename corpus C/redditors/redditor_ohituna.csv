Take a look at all the other cassettes obtained. Notice all the songs are from the 80's, right around when the game takes place?    
Wouldn't make much sense to have a song from 1971 along side all these other super-80's hits.    ",1,0,1444021818,1444732250

cuu3y0d,0,t1_cutzbex,ohituna,"I'm not sure if I misunderstood but you're saying that SOX was a contributing factor to the '08 crisis? I know some of the regulations from it (i.e. sec 404) were rough on smaller entities in terms of compliance costs, thus one could argue it further concentrated power to the largest industries... but I doubt this is what you'd be referring to, but would like to know.       
      
In regard to weakening of EPA/FDA area regulation I'd say that Medicare Part D prohibiting the government from negotiating with drug co.'s on prices was pretty extreme as far as 'getting gov out of the way' goes. But that's not regulation/FDA so to be specific I'd say look no farther than the appt. of Danial Troy as [top lawyer at FDA](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/03/daniel-troys-poison-pill). He is a good example of going beyond deregulation to actually help industry by abusing Federal preemption powers to ax state jurisdiction and filing amicus briefs in favor of drug co's during his tenure. Another highlight of preemption includes shifting the duty of writing warnings on drugs from [PhRMA to FDA](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122403828537735379)       
 
         
I will cede that FDA dereg wasn't that bad, at least compared to EPA's castration. Even in the last days of the Bush Admin there was some [serious dereg](http://www.propublica.org/article/bush-forces-deregulation-in-waning-days-of-administration) like EPA ruling exemption 1.5 mln tons of hazardous solid waste from being treated as such and allowing ""confined animal feeding operations to **voluntarily** apply for permits to discharge waste into waterways"". And long before that was exempting 'fracking' and its fluids from the Safe Drinking Water Act and not letting the fluids be labeled as pollutants under the Clean Water Act to exclude fracking from special EPA oversight and specified that the chemicals used in the process were not to be labeled as pollutants under the Clean Water Act. This was done as part of the 05 Energy Policy Act (see sec 322). The act also exempted oil and gas building activities ""including roads, drill pads, pipeline corridors, refineries, and compressor stations from having to obtain a permit controlling polluted stormwater runoff caused by construction activities, as previously required under the Clean Water Act"" (Sec. 323)quoted text from [Nat Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/295819/cheneys-energy-success-nash-keune). The EPA heads also frequently ignored career EPA staff and scientists [one](http://www.peer.org/news/news-releases/2006/05/25/epa-scientists-protest-pending-pesticide-approvals/) [two](http://www.peer.org/news/news-releases/2006/03/16/epa-dumbing-down-its-research/) [three](http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-epa21dec21-story.html)",1,0,1441685144,1444732250
cutri73,0,t1_cusbu97,ohituna,"Sarbanes-Oxley wasn't really anything groundbreaking and was more general biz regulation than wall st. (though SEC is the intersection of both). I'd say it was alot of pretty common sense stuff in response to the whole MCI/Enron/Tyco/etc.... which is one thing I will give the Bush Admin credit for is prosecution of CEOs and other high-level white collar offenders compared to Eric Holder's Collatoral Consequences BS. However, I'd still say that the GW years bore witness to a very light-touch regulation approach given the castration of EPA, the further coddeling of PhARMA, and you can see the same hands off approach when sales of existing homes began its giant tank in 2005 while foreclosures rose at the same time every month up until the crisis.      
Ultimately though I don't see any of this as ""Clinton's Recession"" or ""Bush's Recession"" or any one entity's fault, that greatly oversimplifies things.",1,0,1441658271,1444732250
