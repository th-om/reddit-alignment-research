cvs3zyk,1,t3_3nrpto,cookiemonster1020,"Her approach to the problem is very interesting and a good example of the use of the scientific method. I don't see this as an example of the triumph of Chinese medicine. To the contrary, this nobel prize is a triumph of using the scientific method. Chinese medicine doesn't know the why anything works (forget about efficacy, doseage and safety too). Now we know that that specific treatment has a chemical that is effective for reducing fever specifically in malaria patients. That is the why for why that medicine reduces fever.",1,0,1444274274,1444724238
cvs3url,1,t3_3nx4d1,cookiemonster1020,"No, traditional chinese medicine is still bullshit. There is no merit to it as a system. It is however useful in providing a database of many substances that may somehow prove be useful in treating disorders though without knowledge of safety, dosage, or even efficacy. There is constantly research on the herbs used in TCM using the scientific method BTW looking at efficacy and for the active chemicals in case the specific herb has a measurable effect. Most of things haven't panned out.",6,0,1444274010,1444724238
