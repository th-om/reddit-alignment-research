Apples & oranges.

An actually life, in the here & now, isn't the same thing as a clump of cells that only has a 40% chance, at best, of becoming an actual, viable life.

If more people paid more attention and took better care for those that are actually alive and in need of proper care, then the need for abortion would diminish greatly.

However, the best part of choice is that if you don't believe in abortion, you can choose to not have one. However, it's none of your god damn business if someone else chooses to have one.

No it's not. You're an idiot.

Did you know that almost 60% of all pregnancies, **known and unknown**, are naturally aborted by the female body.

It's a potential life at best.

I had a friend who lost a baby after they had a baby shower. The gestation took a bad turn and the baby died between 6 -7 months of the pregnancy.

Most often it's a clump of cells that the body flushes out because it's not a viable life.

Almost 60%. Think about that. That makes your imaginary man-in-the-sky quite the prolific abortionist by your standards.

However, if some other person chooses to have one, **it's none of your god damn business**.
