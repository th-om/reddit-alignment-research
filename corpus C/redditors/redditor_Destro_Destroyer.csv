cvx1p23,1,t3_3ofkkl,Destro_Destroyer,Tbh I kinda wish Smite had a mute all button and gave me the option to auto skip the post game lobby.,1,0,1444667337,1444716941
cvwwpqi,1,t3_3odm9e,Destro_Destroyer,Now here's a fun question to ask too--how many conservatives are going to use the ratings of the debate to argue that more people support their candidates?  The answer:  All of them.,3,0,1444658792,1444716941
cvwwnzr,1,t3_3odm9e,Destro_Destroyer,I think 9 million seems to be the right number.  If Kanye was running for the 2016 Dem Nom we might've broken 18 million.,1,0,1444658695,1444716941
cvwwhqo,1,t3_3od8n7,Destro_Destroyer,Democrats don't necessarily hate their leadership.  Also having a history of working in government isn't a checkered flag in the Democratic party as it is within the Republican party.,1,0,1444658340,1444716941
cvuh3y5,1,t3_3o62eb,Destro_Destroyer,"Once the herd thins out. Right now there's no leadership within the party, there's two factions still hedging their bets.",1,0,1444447629,1444716941
cvttjy3,1,t3_3o1skr,Destro_Destroyer,"Honestly I think it's because we're gravitating towards living near people who share our values and mindsets.  Essentially creating impenetrable political fortresses out of districts that once were competitive.  By removing voters who have a difference of political opinion away from one another, and relocating them near others who share the same political values, we've effectively created a system where fringe ideologues can sprout up.  We've also created so many of these districts that there's enough ideologues that can impact the legislative process.",1,0,1444407179,1444716941
cvtnv0h,0,t1_cvtnlip,Destro_Destroyer,"The issue there is because Democrats didn't have to care.  They held the Whitehouse, 60 votes in the Senate (including Specter switching), and the Majority in the House.  You don't have that.  You have the House, a majority in the Senate that isn't filibuster proof, and you don't have the Whitehouse.  That's why Democrats could ignore you because they didn't need you to pass things.  You need Democrats because you don't have absolute control. I don't see where there is hard to grasp.  If you want a conservative agenda passed you're going to need a majority in the house, a filibuster proof senate, and a Republican President.  Otherwise Democrats are going to stonewall you.

Also I'll add this because I've been critical of Bernie Sanders on this point too.  That Bernie and his supporters are disillusion if they think that Bernie getting the Presidency means that his agenda will get passed in the House. Democrats are no where near close to getting a majority in the House for quite some time.  Any policy Bernie supports will garner twice the amount of criticism that anything Obama proposes.  So the same idea applies to the progressives too.  If you want a progressive agenda you better be bringing a majority in the house, 60 votes in the Senate, and a Democratic President to boot, otherwise Republicans will stonewall you.",20,0,1444397980,1444716941
cvtn277,1,t3_3o34id,Destro_Destroyer,I too thought Scalise was going to make a move considering his position and he isn't hated by the Freedom Caucus.  However I'm not sure the GOPe (which is the majority of the party) would be eager to back someone who attended a white supremacist meeting. I think that's why he'll stay on as whip.  I really think they're begging Paul Ryan to take the post.  If not I could see the GOPe backing Webster if it gets down to it. ,3,0,1444396391,1444716941
cvtmtu7,0,t1_cvtmqhh,Destro_Destroyer,"I wouldn't attribute a win or loss to the President or the Speaker during the 90's.  Both worked together.  It's part of the job, but currently I'd say that Gingrich would cave on some issues to allow the opposition some breathing room to cave on some of their issues.  Right now it seems like the lack of leadership in the GOP isn't allowing enough cover for the Democrats or the GOP to allow for the legislative process to work.",12,0,1444395906,1444716941
cvtmn63,0,t1_cvtm1eq,Destro_Destroyer,"See this would work great if only conservatives ran the government. The issue is that the conservative base of the Republican party still isn't the majority of the party.  Effectively they control the most powerful and dedicated minority within the Capitol, but they don't control the majority of seats.  Conservatives seem to forget that the parties gain power from how many purple districts they can control.  

Every news channel wouldn't explain how the President is shutting down the government because you would only need a simple clean CR bill and the Democrats have 188 votes in the House and are more than willing to pass that.  They come off looking reasonable meanwhile the majority party seems to be caving into a very vocal select group of individuals.   That's why the Republicans are always viewed as shutting down the government.

The issue with conservatives is they right now believe they have absolute control over the legislative process.  Conservatives often try and sell this idea that if only a fighter would come along and help solve America's problems.  Guess what, the country isn't all conservative.  There are Democrats, they do exist, and they're not some tiny minority that can be ignored. So there in lies the problem.  When a full opposition party that controls 43% of the house 44% of the Senate you have a problem because no matter what they'll come out and ask for compromise meanwhile the majority in the House will demand no concession and the Senate will work against the House because the Senate by nature of state wide elections is beholden to a lot more Democrats and Moderates than the conservatives of the house are.

Essentially if you drive off the cliff, you drove off the cliff.  You were the one who offered the first ultimatum. Not the President.  The opposition party, and the President offered concessions and were refused by a hard line.  American politics isn't going to side with the person who decided ""We won't play with you if you don't concede to our demands""  That's essentially the conservative case and it will blow up in your face.  Maybe not in Freedom Caucus districts, but in the Suburbs of cities, and heavily urbanized areas it will, and that will close the 247-188 down to maybe a 220-215 in the general.",34,0,1444395499,1444716941
