In fact, my use of misdirection and basic hypnosis on an individual to acquire test material seems to be more unethical than the fallout from said actions! Were such methods called into question, I would wholeheartedly agree.

Instead, we deal with student vs. corporate interests.

Unfortunately schools and students, from certain demographics, are entering a negative feedback cycle due to the fallout from these tests.

We can see this from the data; average scores are falling.

TBQH, this thread became more about my own actions, rather than individual outlook.

This is not the discourse which I sought.

The bigger issue may be the constant disruption low-scoring public schools face from standardized tests... having teachers and curriculums/syllabuses constantly cycled due to low standardized test scores is resulting in negative feedback.

The standardized tests are made by PEARSON.

Explain to me how that corporation is ethical, or deserving of compromise?

They care only about their shareholders, do they not?

The indisputable fact that PEARSON implements a quota on their grading, is this not something which is of greater concern than the actions of a single student?

Indeed, the use of a quota system shows that actual achievement is arbitrary, which is antithesis to the claimed purposes of the standardized tests.",1,0,1444589786,1444719837
