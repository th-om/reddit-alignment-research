Lack of customization for the notifications (no groups, etc etc)

Please.  #shoutyourabortion anyone?

The motto the left used to use was ""safe, legal and rare"".   No one can argue that it is rare today. 

If you really believe that abortions are not ""good"", then the fact that somewhere around 1/3 of women will have one is an insane, pandemic level.

The problem is that the things that people say will reduce abortions (more sex ed, more access to birth control) really don't.  Yes, they help, but you can't argue that those things are at an all time high currently, and so is the abortion rate. ",1,0,1444692438,1444722807
