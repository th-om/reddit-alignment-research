If you sample everyone in your family on what color they like the majority might be blue but if you only ask your older relatives the answer turns out red.

Your making money off of people who need help.

This includes other industries that have forgotten the Hippocratic oath

Most have been doing a terrible job balancing the two. Rubio, Rand and Cruz have all missed quite a few votes.  Christie, Jindal (and while he was running) Walker all absent from their state capitols.

While Bernie Sanders has not missed any votes and has actually been sponsoring many new bills that have yet to see the light of day.
