cvxba47,0,t1_cvxasvi,Sgt_Pepper42,"Ok, you're rightâ€”I wasn't thinking of immigration. But in the absence of immigration, this doesn't really happen voluntarily. And even immigrants retain some aspects of their home culture. For example, most people don't convert to the religion of the country they immigrate to. They don't completely change their values. They take on aspects of the country they go to, sure, but they don't relinquish the culture they were raised in.

What I really meant in my original comment is that it isn't right to think someone is inferior based on the culture they are part of. Like, when people say ""those who live in X country are inferior to me because X culture is inferior to my culture"". As long as you get what I was trying to say there, we're on the same page.",1,0,1444681282,1444729088

cvx9kcm,0,t1_cvx6x8c,Sgt_Pepper42,"> I don't mean that a person can change the culture of others.

I never indicated that you were saying that. 

What I'm saying is that while you can change your subculture/the aspect of your culture that arises from socioeconomic status, you can't change the culture that comes from which region of the world you were born in, or at least, it is very challenging to do so.",2,0,1444678845,1444729088

cvx2c3s,0,t1_cvx1wis,Sgt_Pepper42,"It is most definitely unheard of for someone who lives in a Mumbai slum to somehow change to the culture of someone who lives in an upper class Los Angeles suburb, or vice versa.

cvx1y8e,0,t1_cvx13ja,Sgt_Pepper42,"Self defense and extensions of self defense are the exception though. Allied propaganda posters in WW2 incited violence against the Nazis, but there's nothing wrong with that.

cvx1sce,0,t1_cvx0wax,Sgt_Pepper42,"Think about it this way: Let's say an individual grows up in an upper class neighborhood in Los Angeles. An individual with the exact same genes and innate characteristics grows up in a slum in Mumbai. These two individuals would be completely different people. They will be exposed to completely different stimuli that will shape them completely differently. They will react to these stimuli in completely different ways.

Here's another example: The vast majority of people stay the same religion throughout their whole life. Religion is part of culture. Do these people keep their religion because that was the religion they chose? No, it's because that's how they were brought up, taught to believe, and encouraged to think. Some people do change how they act culturally, or what they believe religiously. These people are the exceptions. Most people don't do this.

I think what you're describing refers mostly to subcultures within the framework of the US. That's easier to for someone to change. But when geographic differences get thrown into the mix, it's much harder for people to react differently to the culture around them. 

While people can sometimes change the part of their ""culture"" that is based on socioeconomic status, it is much harder and extremely uncommon to change their cultural values that are based on where they grew up. It does happen, but is very rare.

All culture is anyway is a set of values and traditions that one is brought up to believe in. It's not any monolithic set of rules that determines how all people of a certain ethnicity or nationality act. (Not that I think you're saying anything like that, I'm just clarifying that for myself.) If people are discriminated against for their culture, it is definitely discrimination because of a characteristic because they can't control.

Anyway, I think what you're saying kind of makes sense, but you're not looking at cultural differences at a big enough scale. ",2,0,1444667475,1444729088
cvx0my2,0,t1_cvx0iht,Sgt_Pepper42,"Nope, you can't control the circumstances into which you were born. And culture is a direct result of the circumstances under which you grow up in.
