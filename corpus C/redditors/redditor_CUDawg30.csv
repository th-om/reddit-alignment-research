cvxpqg9,1,t3_3oj5x5,CUDawg30,"The National Collegiate Athletic Association D1 football rules committee didn't adopt the overtime rule until February 16, 1996 for all games. The NCAA did adopt a overtime rule for all post season bowl games a year earlier  for the 1995 football season. Before that the only conference that had a overtime rule was the Southeastern Conference and even that was only for the Southeastern Conference Championship game which began to be played in 1992. The reason that the Southeastern Conference had the rule before the rest of college football was due to the rule that allowed conferences to have a conference championship game had a provision that had a overtime rule involved that lower level NCAA divisions used.

cvxkge3,1,t3_3oibo6,CUDawg30,Without a doubt its Strong. Tennessee didn't dominate Georgia like Texas did to Oklahoma. Georgia was only a three point favorite to beat Tennessee while Texas was a double digit dog to Oklahoma. Another point is that Georgia has just gotten destroyed at home a week earlier.  ,2,0,1444695490,1444720073

No matter what though Brent should have never interacted with an opposing player. He is the coach at Arkansas not Alabama.

cvwqh4x,1,t3_3oemd1,CUDawg30,"Well the Byzantine Empire was an Hellenic state for the most part before the Ottomans took over the area. For the Byzantines in later years of the Empire this is especially true but I don't really think that is the answer your looking for.  

The Corinthians were the last of the fully independent Greek city states that the Romans had to defeat to gain control of the Greek peninsula. The Aegean islands were added 10 years later. The southern Greek city states operated on a semi-independent status. Athens lead a revolt of the simi-independent city states 58 years after the fall of the Corinthians and were defeated by General Sulla. 61 years after the failed uprising lead by Athens the area was reorganized by Augustus into the province known as Achaea.

Notable City State defeat by Rome and her allies.

cvwpxkb,1,t3_3o79r3,CUDawg30,"Imperator Caesar Nerva Traianus Divi Nervae filius Augustus aka Trajan is my favorite. His military campaigns expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent adding the Nabataean kingdom, Dacia, Armenia, and Mesopotamia to the Empire. He is known for his philanthropic rule, overseeing extensive public building programs and implementing social welfare policies. He presided over an era of peace and prosperity in the Mediterranean world. Trajan's Forum, Trajan's Market and Trajan's Column (His ashes were located in the foot of that column) are named after him. The Roman Senate declared Trajan as optimus princeps (""the best ruler"") at the time of his death in 117 AD",1,0,1444635165,1444720073

First the current Constitution of the State of Texas was adopted on February 15, 1876 (21 years after Texas joined the Union). There have been a total of nine Constitutions that Texas has operated under include the one under Mexico and its independent one. 

Second. In its current form the Constitution of the State of Texas only grants the State of Texas those powers explicitly granted to it by the United States Constitution.",0,0,1444634044,1444720073
cvwpadz,1,t3_3of2uy,CUDawg30,There are more Libertarians within the Republican Party than the Libertarian Party itself. Its a natural fit to be honest. Libertarianism and Conservatism share a common ideological agreement on many issues most importantly is the limited role of government both share. In truth the only real difference between Libertarians and a Republican is on the social liberties issues.      ,17,0,1444632843,1444720073

I think Oklahoma would have to have one of those leagues have a two loss champion for Oklahoma to get in. Maybe they get in over a one loss ACC team seeing as Oklahoma gets TCU and Baylor later on. The Texas loss is a really bad loss. ",2,0,1444625747,1444720073
