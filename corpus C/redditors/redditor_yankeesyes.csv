cvrmxqa,0,t1_cvrmo85,yankeesyes,"The 3-strikes laws were even worse.  Someone had a criminal past, got 2 convictions years ago.  A girlfriend or spouse accuses him of hitting her, he's convicted and spends the rest of his life in jail for he said/she said.  Bad stuff.

I feel there should have been more jury nullification.  I wouldn't have convicted someone for a relatively menial crime (like drug possession) if they were going to prison for the rest of their life.",3,0,1444246865,1444725395
cvrmlyc,0,t1_cvrejj5,yankeesyes,"I don't know if I agree with that.  I mean, it is pertinent information if someone has violated the law in a serious manner.  I could see it as you wouldn't have to check that box if its been longer than 10 years or even 5, but it is something I don't think should be concealed.  In any case any background check or even a Google search will reveal most felonies.

I'm looking at it as legitimate that people re earn the trust of society- that may limit the jobs they can get but at the same time protect employers (and their employees) from violent offenders.",2,0,1444246392,1444725395
