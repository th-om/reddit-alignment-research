cvxvkv0,1,t3_3ojrjq,askinnydude,"The Democratic party has a centre-left neoliberal wing (i.e. ""Third Way"" practicioners) and a further left progressive wing (e.g. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren). The progressives in particular are supported by labor unions, which are the group that stands to lose the most when markets are expanded.

Basically, unions essentially gain power through monopolizing labor, to some extent - you have to negotiate with them (in some fields) or you won't be able to get any workers at all. If trade barriers are lowered, however, other labor markets become more cost effective, reducing the bargaining power unions have.

Union workers make up a minority of voters but are an important source of donations.",1,1,1444715379,1444718614

cvxul4r,1,t3_3ojfa1,askinnydude,"I'm interested to see who wins but I don't think the outcome really will affect relations between the US and Canada.

I also think it's harder for us to follow foreign parliamentary elections because they happen at irregular intervals. Ours are pre-scheduled, and campaigning happens for longer durations, so even people without interest in politics know what's going on.",1,1,1444712678,1444718614

I've played a little bit of SWTOR, though, (I'm on The Shadowlands as Turai/Kareh) and so far there have only been a handful of references to the original two games. I'm not sure how much it would add to your experience there.",1,0,1444706870,1444718614
cvxrkkn,0,t1_cvxd3ui,askinnydude,"State and local governments account for close to half of public spending, and property tax accounts for [something like 25% of local/state tax revenue](http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/year_revenue_2016USbn_16bs1n_40#usgs302). That $541 billion makes property tax the biggest source of revenue for local/state governments (income tax is close behind but not all states levy it).",1,1,1444706630,1444718614
cvxqfp4,1,t3_3oj8zy,askinnydude,"Ugh, I can't believe someone would claim academic expertise to spread this sort of nonsense. The Democratic party (founded 1828) was founded on liberal principles, not Marxist ones.

Funny, though, how European ""socialists"" (like Hollande) support the same neoliberal policies as the Democrats in the United States, but somehow don't ever get mentioned on /r/politics.",4,0,1444704768,1444718614
cvxpeyd,0,t1_cvx8bcd,askinnydude,"Sure, that's certainly a valid opinion. Just thought it was worth pointing out the liberal perspective (i.e. Locke), given that's the ideological foundation a lot of Americans use.",1,0,1444703139,1444718614
