Not saying that people shouldn't be allowed to defend themselves, I'm saying it's stupid to criticize the president for being surrounded by the secret service, because in POTUS' case, it is necessary.  Any one of us could be mugged, sure, but the odds of that happening for the vast majority of us are pretty low too.

cvodqqy,0,t1_cvoc1ca,handle_5,Not at all.  I'm saying that we don't need to be surrounded by secret service agents because we don't receive several hundred threats/week.  ,1,0,1444003799,1444732126
cvobyjt,0,t1_cvobm2u,handle_5,"FFS.  POTUS receives hundreds of death threats every week, many of them serious, which is why an armed escort is required.  The president isn't requesting that level of protection, it comes with the job.  How many death threats have you received, ever?  Me - none, not a single one.  And I would bet that you haven't either.  It's a disingenuous argument.  It's not that POTUS is more important, it's that threats are made on their lives every day, while regular citizens don't face anywhere near that level of risk.  ",1,0,1444000632,1444732126
