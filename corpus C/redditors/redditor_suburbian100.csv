But I am still uncomfortable with the idea that the things we write or say, when privacy is a reasonable expectation, could be grounds for suspension/firing/legal consequences.",2,0,1443918707,1444726404
cv8n7jq,0,t1_cv8gcuf,suburbian100,"Thank you for this. And yes, many of the people who foster are true heroes IMO (often relatives).

A majority of the victims have parents who know their rights and are experienced at milking the system. Their children become pawns and DCF can only do so much. 

DCF workers are also notoriously overworked, and not because the overall State budget isn't ginormous. Every constituent group in Mass has their hands in the cookie jar, and their causes often win out because kids don't get to vote.",4,0,1442804293,1444726404
cv8mpui,0,t1_cv81uny,suburbian100,"Why is income ""inequality"" the issue? Incomes are not meant to be equal, just as life is not meant to be fair. Remember, not too long ago our ancestors were practically living under the stars; hunting with spears. The best hunters were not condemned for keeping their tribes fat and happy.

I care not to make income equal and suffer the consequences of less efficient means of distribution.

I do care, however, to make opportunity as equal as it can be. We should work on concrete solutions to actual problems, like improving education for children who are poor or come from broken homes. 

When rhetoric (and in my opinion propaganda) like BLM dominates the collective conscience, who loses? Not the .1% of the 1%. Believe me, they'll be OK. It's the kids who suffer, thanks to adults who divert attention from actual (solvable) problems.",0,0,1442803483,1444726404

When you said ""no reason to draw his weapon,"" you were not citing laws or policies that were written in response to similar incidents that have occurred many times. You were rushing to offer a judgement based on a video which does not purport to give the entire story.

Most law enforcement people hold themselves to higher standards than that.",1,0,1442761833,1444726404

Correct - you have no training. So venturing opinions on a matter you know nothing about makes you seem ignorant. ",0,0,1442747262,1444726404
