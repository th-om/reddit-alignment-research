https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide

> In general, a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, mollusks, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors.

> the well-known dirty dozen

That is published by the Environmental Working Group, which is not the best source for science. The Dirty Dozen list has been [criticized](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3135239/) and also doesn't factor the organic pesticides that are used in organic agriculture.

> It should also be mentioned that consumption of organic produce should not be equated with consumption of pesticide-free produce.

> In summary, findings conclusively demonstrate that consumer exposures to the ten most frequently detected pesticides on EWG's “Dirty Dozen” commodity list are at negligible levels and that the EWG methodology is insufficient to allow any meaningful rankings among commodities.",2,0,1444629190,1444725940

This has literally never happened. It's probably the number one GMO myth floating around. No farmer has ever been sued for accidental contamination.",13,0,1444628005,1444725940
cvwnnfs,0,t1_cvwngem,ribbitcoin,"> genetically modified to enhance the presence of neonicotinoid toxins in the plant structure itself

I am genuinely unaware and have never heard of this, hence my questioning. My understanding is that Bt is not a neonicotinoid. The only relationship I could find with GMOs that is they (as well as non-GMOs) have a neonicotinoid seed treatment, which has nothing to do with genetic engineering.
