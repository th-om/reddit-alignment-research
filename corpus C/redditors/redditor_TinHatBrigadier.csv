cv1j9na,0,t1_cv1bygb,TinHatBrigadier,"How does that compare to how many tellers were on duty before ATMs were in wide use? I grew up in a very small town, and I can remember going to the bank with my mom and seeing six or seven tellers on duty with another person or two manning the drive-through banking area. Contrast that with the present, when I've never seen more than two tellers on duty at my bank, which is for a much larger area. 

Honestly, if it weren't for a handful of people I know who prefer to do business with checks or cash, I would never go to the physical bank, even for the ATM. If it were as easy for private individuals to transfer money as it is to swipe my debit card at a store, I'd probably have no use for a physical bank again.",1,0,1442262387,1444731926
cuvjehy,0,t1_cuvhxmk,TinHatBrigadier,"To be fair, most high-ranking Democrats didn't come out in support of gay marriage until very recently. Whether that's because their positions have shifted with the times, or whether they simply felt it prudent to deny their position, it's only been a Democratic talking point in the last few years.

Some social liberals (in the classical liberal sense) may have been 100% for equality for homosexuals without being for gay marriage. For example, I'm opposed to any state registration of romantic and sexual relationships and would have rather seen the legal institution of marriage fully abolished.  

EDIT: This sounded like I missed your point - I totally understand that she's *not* liberal, for various reasons.  I'm just not sure that gay marriage itself is necessarily a fundamental position for social liberals.",29,0,1441804521,1444731926

cutlqca,0,t1_cuti9ce,TinHatBrigadier,"Has the government ever won a war on anything other than another government? I believe it surrendered the war on alcohol (though, I'm not sure that was formally declared), the wars on poverty are *super* effective.  As you pointed out, fighting discrimination with a top-down approach hasn't gone well.  

I get very frustrated when people like my wife (who worked for the state and currently works in a position where she works closely with the state) will complain about a lot of the idiocy, incompetence, laziness, and even outright corruption in one area, but then they'll turn around and fully support other government ""solutions"" to problems.  It's like the [Gell-Mann  Amnesia effect](http://seekerblog.com/2006/01/31/the-murray-gell-mann-amnesia-effect/), but for government.",4,0,1441646889,1444731926
cutfb8r,0,t1_cut6iot,TinHatBrigadier,"My understanding, from talking to some anarcho-communists, is that people will magically become generous and share equally if only we get rid of the capitalism that turns us into greedy monsters.

cum2cot,0,t1_cum0k7i,TinHatBrigadier,"The funny thing, to me, is that I started tracking my calories, and I have no problem whatsoever with my ""budget"" for that. If I eat over for a day, I feel like I let myself down, but I get a new batch the next day to try again.  I think what demoralizes me so bad about finances is that if I screw up, there's nothing I can do to fix it until the next pay period, which can be up to two weeks away.

EDIT to add: I grew up in a family where Money Rule Number One was that you don't talk about money. My parents gave me a bit of money as an allowance, and I got paid for doing mechanic work for Dad's small business, but there was never any discussion at all about spending money responsibly. I went out of control in college on spending, and have never been able to fully rein in my tendencies to spend impulsively.",1,0,1441044294,1444731926
culzwyq,0,t1_culxbc3,TinHatBrigadier,"Biden was elected, but he was elected as VP, not President. 

> Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.

If Bill were elected as VP, he wouldn't be ""elected to the office of the President."" There's some ambiguity there. I'd personally argue that the obvious intent of the amendment is that he could not legally run. However, the wording of the amendment is such that he could. 

Given that the Supreme Court seems to decide quite often that the *intent* of the law, not the words of the law, are what matters, they'd probably decide that he could not run, if the question were raised. I think they'd be wrong, just as I think they've been wrong every other time they've put the supposed ""intent"" of the writers over the words of the law, but that's another discussion.",6,0,1441040635,1444731926
