cvkj5z9,0,t1_cvkiqwh,nigelmansellmustache,"I know what you mean but technically, Nope. They used an electric starter and centrifugal clutch. They are more similar to the Parilla Leopard/X30. Now They've gone back to no electric starter, no clutch, and the water pump can be internal or external. The driver sprocket is right on the crank like the good ol days. But they've also added a decompression valve to make bump starting a lot easier. Hopefully they get rid of front brakes for OK karts as well. 

I got to test drive a Vortex Rock DVS set up with no clutch, which is pretty much the same as the new OK engines; it ruled. I've raced it all from 4 cycle's to KZ's over the last decade :). I'm a lucky dude. ",2,0,1443711399,1444731616
