cvx4yxe,1,t3_3oeqvu,JoePragmatist,"Pizza delivery guy here.  Last winter, I was on a delivery to a bunch of college kids at an apartment building nearby the shop. It was after midnight, my last run of the night, and so was the only thing keeping me from cleaning and going home.  Get there, call five or six times, no answer.  Tried texting him, still nothing.  At that point my patience had about run out and the only thing keeping me there was that I really didn't want to hop back in my car and start driving back only to get a call from the customer telling me he was on the way down.  It had been over ten minutes of waiting when I said fuck it, calling one more time and if they don't answer I'm leaving.  Finally, he answered but his reception was terrible.  Still, I managed to explain to him through the static and his shitfacedness that I was here and he needed to come get his damn food.

So after about three or four minutes of more waiting, I finally heard the guy stumbling down the stairs down sloppy drunk.  He was a model of a shitty overprivileged college bro; pre-distressed jeans, a too-tight striped button down shirt, ugly chunky overpriced watch, a head full of gelled back black hair and he reeked of alcohol and way too much cologne.  I didn't think I could loathe him more before I saw him but he blew all of my preconceived expectations of his douchiness away.   He paid me, I counted it and (of course) it was five bucks short. I told him if he couldn't pay for his whole order he wasn't getting any of it, dropped his money on the ground at his feet, turned around and stormed back to my car. The mixture of anger, sadness, and dickishness on his face as his drunk ass realized what was happening was not worth the wait but maaaaan did it help a lot.

As I got to my car, his (significantly cooler and more sober friend) stopped me, apologized profusely, and told me they'd find the money to pay for the order. A minute or two later he came back, and with a decent tip.",9,0,1444672231,1444717119
