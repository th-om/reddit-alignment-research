cvrv2xf,1,t3_3nti3c,BanjoBilly,"Check out Roger Garrison's Head to Head and [ABCT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHw5ms3bBS4) videos. The part about the ""Structure of Production"" starts at around 44 mins in.

This [Hayek vs Keynes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gMaYudvIiY) should show the differences between the Structure of Production and the Circular Flow theory.

[Roger Garrison's site](http://www.auburn.edu/~garriro/) also has all the Power-point Presentations available for download.

Once you've looked at those I'd like your opinion on which theory makes more sense to you. To me it's obvious just who is more correct.

Edit.

There's a poster in this subreddit who has written some fantastic articles about Roger Garrison and his site is worth reading. Here's the first of his Garrison articles [The Genius of Roger Garrison (and a Reconciliation with Lachmann and Friedman)](https://hxcbastard.wordpress.com/2014/10/28/the-genius-of-roger-garrison-and-a-reconciliation-with-lachmann-and-friedman-13/).",2,0,1444259414,1444717676
