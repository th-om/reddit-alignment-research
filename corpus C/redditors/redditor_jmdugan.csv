Here, let us translate;

 ""Your view threatens my attachments, but I'd really, really still like to Win this silly online argument (lest be forced by conscience to evaluate how I know what I think I do) so please show me how to better undercut you personally instead'

without even the simplest attempt to answer your own question. Reddit had made us lazy

Since you asked, the degree is not the source of real authority, rather it is intellectual integrity; plus we often can learn far, far more after leaving school than while in it

cvsl4rq,0,t1_cvskiln,jmdugan,"the downvote brigade on my comment above has already started, I expect it'll go hidden.  it doesn't change the reality, and I'm not editing nor deleting it.

I'm basing my opinions off years of training as a real scientist, studying philosophy of science, and watching economics and economists and their arguments carefully.

bluntly: economics is not science, not even social science.  it's worse.  it's essentially high-paid opinion.

in science, theories are proposed, and everyone attacks them.  data to the contrary conflicts with the theory, and then the theory is rejected.  in physical sciences, the gold standard is the independently observable behavior of the real world.  **theories that accrue enough conflicting evidence are rejected.**  In economics, they are not.  otherwise, we wouldn't have people still spouting trickle down works.  There's a wide variety of reasons for this: economics is closer to politics, data collection is hard, the theories don't make easily measurable predictions, there's disagreement what the data means, there's incredible stake in rich oligarchs having the story they need, so they simply pay economists to promote that story (which also happens in science, just not to such a degree because mostly other scientists don't put up with that behavior while many economists do)

could go on and on, but fully expect no one on this sub wants to hear how the whole field of economics is basically inauthentic.

come read /r/collapse for a few days, one nuclear disaster in St Louis?  that's child play.  Fukishima is still leaking tons.

But climate: 6 degree C is coming.  we blew through 350ppm, then 400 and it's growing still.  not even slowed.  even if every country does everything they promise (and even now they are breaking those promises) we still are __totally__ fscked as a species.

the last time co2 was this high, seas were 8 meters higher than now.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth's_atmosphere#Current_concentration

US and Russia are in a proxy war in Syria.  Saudi will fail.  once Israel and Iran get involved, and the mideast blows up, no one will say the crackpots who are already arguing we're in WWIII were wrong.

Climate change will displace hundreds of millions from Africa.  Riots, refugees like you can't believe.

Greenland and antarctic ice sheet melting rates are increasing so fast, we can't build models fast enough to understand them.  new greenhouse gasses that are flammable are coming out of the ground so fast now scientists are worried they will ignite large sections of atmosphere.

the financial system globally is an interconnect web of corporations that enable the function of the whole globe, and it's falling apart completely. 
the debt loads in emerging markets now average 120% of annual GDP, and rising quickly to meet the loads of developed nations.  sovereign debt is so high central banks can't sell the debt from printing more money, and with 3 rounds of QE, the US Fed is powerless to prevent another 2008 style abyss fall.  Just yesterday Deutche Bank announced a 5.2B correction, and have 75 Trillion of derivatives debt on their books - changes in commodities prices most analysts predict mean massive, multi-trillion dollar debts completely unserviceable from the major banks, leading to financial ruin for most everyone.  Bank runs across the globe.  worthless fiat.  no commerce.  riots.  chaos.

Plague, deforestation, coral dying, corporations buying up the water, credible predictions of 95% of species extinctions, bees being poisoned by insecticides we know are killing them, fish running ashore, whales beaching, a third of frogs and cactus facing extinction right now, the very web of species and food we depend upon is disintegrating.

Mass shootings are higher than ever in the US.  Mental health is a mess, basically we throw people into prison or on a bus.  San Francisco, a once beautiful technology mecca is full of human shit and trash, and run by young tech assholes too rich and stupid to care.   Fires are run amok across the US west.  


the list is so long I can't even catalog it any more.  this is just off the top of my head after breakfast.
