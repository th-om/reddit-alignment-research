cvxv48h,0,t1_cvxqxdg,Katamayan,"Do you think british farmers could have predicted the industrial revolution, do you think fortran programmers in the 50s could predict the apple watch?  Humans have never been good at predicting the future because there are frequently major, unpredictable changes.  we still don't have flying cars, or our letters delivered by rockets.

We gave the AI Singularity its name because it bears passing similarity to gravitational singularities, in which our current laws of physics don't apply.  There is no concrete evidence to prove hypotheses about the AI singularity.  Moores law will soon stall when we hit 6nm, there are plenty of limits within our programming languages.  All of these issues will require a significant concerted effort by humanity before the circumstances are even viable for an AI singularity to take place.  The possibility that there will be an intelligence explosion does not make the minutia of the future any less predictable.

Given this, what is the issue with extending the singularity analogy to human evolution, when it is already a licentious reference to gravitational singularities?",2,0,1444714062,1444728556
cvxmmz8,0,t1_cvxmii0,Katamayan,"of course I'm not talking about an AI singularity, the concept can be applied to other areas.

AI limited by human intelligence.
Progresses beyond our cognition.
Unpredictable effects.

Cultural evolution limited by evolution.
Progresses beyond control of natural selection.
Unpredictable effects.",2,0,1444698861,1444728556
cvxm8kk,0,t1_cvxg3ig,Katamayan,"You can't deny it though, humanity reached a technological singularity hundreds of years ago, as soon as our evolutionary means of adaptation were outpaced by our technological means.  Technology has now not only outpaced evolution, it has entirely stalled it.  So many of our cultural norms are dictated by historical processes and emotions, forcing technology to fit within its bounds.  So many of our human processes are designed for irrelevant situations.

Can you honestly say that you couldn't redesign society to be more efficient?",4,0,1444698257,1444728556

If Steam decided not to release ports that came later than their console counterparts, it would be a massively different story.

On the flip side, because the barrier to entry for PC development is so low, PC gets all of the bleeding edge video games.",2,0,1444619519,1444728556
cvwiqkg,0,t1_cvwdxek,Katamayan,"> Afaik the only reason those particular games run at 30fps is to attempt to avoid fps changes in high-activity areas (it just looks ugly, pc players experience it all the time).

ie they have problems with 30fps.  There shouldn't be any shame in admitting it, Microsoft and Sony are building consoles to a price and profit margins.  While they've been organising the current generation, games development has outpaced them.  Games are no longer designed with hardware limitations as a primary focus.

You're not an inferior person for playing on a console, but you've undeniable given up some freedom in graphics quality, just as PC players have forfeited console exclusives.",2,0,1444617570,1444728556
cvvqul0,0,t1_cvvpsqe,Katamayan,"I am aware of that.  However, the fight in this sort of thing is always for undecided neutral parties, and the best sources for that sort of thing are ones that aren't biased.

I mean seriously, surely there's something better to put down than:
>When Queen Bey's not crushing the patriarchy, she's crushing heternormativity by ensuring that her products don't reinforce stereotypes about who we're supposed to love.

>Next time you get a huge hit down there, you should thank precious womankind, because the inventor of the jockstrap is one of them.

>Women's integration in the workforce after World War II translated into massive macroeconomic gains.

I mean if you go through the article, there are few that are in recent history, have more than tenuous relations to feminism, and were directly designed to benefit men.

Imo just linking the rape is rape campaign would be a better choice.  And honestly?  I don't think it should be surprising or bad that the majority of positive effects towards men are trickle down.  It's in the name, feminism is a movement that primarily addresses female inequality in society.  Just like any demographically biased movement or organisation,  they are going to be most empathetic and well equipped to deal with the issues of their participants.  Again imo, the frequent maligning of feminism is because people try to present it as something other than that.",3,0,1444567159,1444728556
