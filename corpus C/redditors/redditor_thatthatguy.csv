Humans are a distant fifth after the psychic hive-mind ants, the xeno-yeasts that the ants farm, a curious parasitic/symbiotic hook-worm that appears to be living inside just about everything, and the species of hyperintelligent flying stealth dinosaurs sometimes called crows.

cvtza71,0,t1_cvts2rt,thatthatguy,"I guess we have to really dig down to what we mean by destroyed.   A person may be destroyed when they are killed, yet there remains a physical shell that once was part of them, and a metaphysical soul that (usually) travels elsewhere.  Also, there is their influence on others, their teachings, writings, or other interactions.  People often talk about having a part of the person after they have been destroyed in this way.  While the person is destroyed, there are important parts of them that remain.

So, by breaking the enchantments that held the heart in place, and harnessed it for power, it could be said that the heart was destroyed.  The thing that Dagoth Ur was tapping for power could no longer be tapped for power.  However, the part that was destroyed may not have been the metaphysically important part.  Hypothetically, another series of enchantments, or wibbly wobbly timey wimey machinations might harness the power of the heart again in some other time/place/whatever.

TL;DR: we have to be careful about using words like ""destroyed"" when it comes to metaphysical concepts.  ",1,0,1444415703,1444728680

Anyway, it's not a bad theory.  There's not a lot of supporting evidence, not like there is for the Civil War questline having been intended to be so much more.  There are some clues in favor of the theory, and it isn't inconsistent with anything i can think of.",3,0,1444309768,1444728680
cvra9u4,0,t1_cvr2nhs,thatthatguy,"A potentially useful reference: http://felonvoting.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004339

State prisons are mostly filled with those convicted of violent crimes (~700,000 out of 1,300,000 or 53%).  Federal prisons are mostly filled with those convicted of drug crimes (99,000 out of 190,000 or 56%).  Combined state and Federal, there are almost twice as many inmates on violent convictions than drug convictions (~720,000 vs 310,000).

It's a pretty complicated issue, and both of us are glossing over most of it.  Still, it's not drug offenders that make up the majority of the total prison population unless you are looking only at Federal jurisdiction.",5,0,1444228123,1444728680
cvqnevw,1,t3_3nr1xp,thatthatguy,"The Force interacts with user's minds through the primal emotional part of the brain, rather than the conscious mind.  In that respect, its control of your body is something akin to a reflex.  The Force can cause your body to act without your conscious mind even being aware of it.  At the same time, with a little work, Force users can learn to interact with the Force by consciously manipulating their own emotional state.

The mind of a Force user, and the Force itself have some control over the body.  The Force tends to act on a subtle, instinctual level.  It's often hard to tell when you're doing something on your own, or if you're being guided by the Force.  If you consciously decide to reach out and touch a pipe, that's your mind.  When you yank your scalded hand back from the burning hot pipe before your mind even registers that it's hot, that's reflexes.  If your hand just pulls away from the hot pipe before even touching it, that's possibly the Force.
