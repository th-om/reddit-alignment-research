Even before college, I would say our youth development programs feel the biggest high when middle school boys drop out.

cvtq0ug,1,t3_3o3ldf,DiscursiveMind,"Part of it is due to the dilution of talent. Soccer is a very popular sport for younger kids here in America, but there is a big shift once kids reach their pre-teens and teenage years. A lot of kids will gravitate away from soccer to pursue baseball, football, or basketball. So quite a few of our very best athletes just simply quit, and it creates a kind of talent vacuum. Not to begrudge our Men's National team, but the talent dilution isn't nearly as strong of a phenomena for women. That's why the US women are more of a global force than the men.

It is kind of a chicken and the egg problem. The Men's team will need to become more competitive on the world scene (ranking in the top 10 constantly), and we need more talented players to stick around for that to happen. Rising salaries and world prestige will keep the players in the talent pool, but that's not going to happen if people keep leaving soccer when they hit middle school. It is going to take a decline of the popularity of the NBA, NFL, and MLB before this starts to happen.",9,0,1444401790,1444730753
cvnlkb5,0,t1_cvms5io,DiscursiveMind,"> Thirdly, allow students to conceal carry on campus.

I'm sorry but this is one of those things that sounds good on the surface, but once you dig into it, you find out it is a horrible idea.

Most college students fall into the category of ""emerging adult"", which generally can be classified as ages 18-25 [[1](http://www.rinaldipsych.synthasite.com/resources/Arnett.pdf)]. Of course, not all college students are under 25, but over [31.4 million of them are](http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=98), and they make up the majority with a [little less than 2/3rds of the student body](http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/about/media_center/press_releases/files/release_2012-04-19.pdf) here in the US. So I think it is fair to focus on students that fall into this range for this discussion.

We now know that the human brain doesn't stop fully developing until around our mid 20's [[2](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jay_Giedd/publication/8457361_Structural_magnetic_resonance_imaging_of_the_adolescent_brain/links/0046351b08f042fdc8000000.pdf)]. There is a reason rental car companies charge higher rates for those under 25. Research has shown that in your twenties, increased connections between the prefrontal cortex and the emotional and motor center of the brains. These increased interconnection are associated with increased cognitive control [[3](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kirsten_OHearn/publication/26823354_What_has_fMRI_told_us_about_the_development_of_cognitive_control_through_adolescence/links/0c960520e2c7f5f379000000.pdf)]. Note, this isn't to say that people under 25 lack cognitive control; you can find plenty of 18 year olds who would demonstrate better cognitive control than some people twice their age. It is to show that people's ability to resist impulsive actions and control emotional turmoil tends to improve from their early twenties to their late twenties. Factors that would be important when dealing with the question of if students should be allowed to carry on campus.

With that in mind, there is a even more pressing issue why allowing students to cary is issue worthy of concern. Seventy-five percent of any lifetime DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse-control and substance abuse disorder begins before age 24 [[4](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.413.8494&rep=rep1&type=pdf)]. This emerging adult phase is when a lot of mental health issues can appear. The median onset of substance abuse disorders is 18-27 [4]. Schizophrenia increases rapidly from puberty into the mid twenties [[5](http://news.nursesfornurses.com.au/test/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Mentalhealthdisordersandageofonset-1.pdf)]. This [graph](http://imgur.com/DyOBSJP) helps to show this trend. 

Given that we know that college students are at increased risk for mental health issues, they are in the final stages of brain maturation, and that suicides are the third leading cause of deaths for this population [[6](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Nemeroff/publication/227652424_Depression_desperation_and_suicidal_ideation_in_college_students_results_from_the_American_Foundation_for_Suicide_Prevention_College_Screening_Project_at_Emory_University/links/0912f5034d77f3f24a000000.pdf)], is bringing more guns into this equation going to help? I have no doubt that out of that 31.4 million+ students, you could find plenty of responsible 18-25 year olds who could prove this concept could work. But I'm not worried about those. I'm worried about the one that thinks it won't be a problem if they carry to a party, because they were not going to drink, and then does so anyways. These students would probably be the outliers, but it is the outliers that are the biggest problem here. By bringing in guns to protect against a hypothetical active shooter event, you've increased the odds of having a gun related incident that doesn't involve a shooter event. There would be increased suicides, accidental discharges, and aggravated assaults, all in the hopes that a conceal carry would be able to stop an active shooter. 160 active shooter events occurred in the [US from 2000-2013](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/september/fbi-releases-study-on-active-shooter-incidents/pdfs/a-study-of-active-shooter-incidents-in-the-u.s.-between-2000-and-2013). The risk vs reward just doesn't pan out on this one.

On average, the pharmasutical company is looking at [10-15 years](http://www.focr.org/sites/default/files/feeds/AACR%20CPR.jpg) of work from potential drug discovery to FDA approval and getting your drug on the market. The [FDA approval process is arduous](http://www.focr.org/fda-regulatory-policy). Out of the 5,000-10,000 potential drug candidates entering the FDA approval pipeline, only 1 on average will make it to market [[3]](http://www.iosrphr.org/papers/v4i01/G04010043048.pdf).

Now all of that is well known, but the BS move is that his company purchased a drug that had already been developed. It already was one of 5,000 to 10,000 candidates, the ~~billions~~ millions* have already been spent (*since the drug was developed in the 60s). The only debt you have is what you bought the drug for and the cost associated with monitoring for adverse drug events. He is simply an opportunistic asshole that got caught and is in spin mode. People wonder why healthcare cost are out of control? It is guys this this CEO right here, that why.

cv9x0gt,1,t3_3lw8yo,DiscursiveMind,"You are being overcritical about the research. It can be a cherry on top of the sunday, but it won't make or break a Masters application for most schools. I wouldn't sweet it, research experience is fine, but for a large number of Masters students, their thesis with be their first, and last major research project they ever conduct.

In a Masters program you specialize in a topic, a PhD is where you learn how to conduct research. 

Your GPA looks good, you have some industry experience, and I'm sure you will land a good GRE score. Just find some solid letters of recommendations. Also, they don't have to be professors, anybody that can vouch for your character and work ethic is good, so even bosses are fine. Just make sure they feel comfortable with it, and will give you a good letter. 

Give it some thought on what you want to study. Don't know what that is yet? Start searching google scholar on topics you are interested in and start reading current journal articles. Once you have a couple of topics you like, start to make a list of schools and get in touch with a few professors there. You might not be able to get into MIT or Stanford, but UT Austin looks to have a top 10 program for Masters, if you wanted to go back.

Also, swing by /r/GradAdmissions if you have any additional questions. You might find someone with a little better insight to your particular field.",1,0,1442899856,1444730753
