Yes, if the Post Office were to sell all of their land, property, and other assets they could just barely afford their currently accrued retiree benefits. They would then have to default on their $15 billion debt, their $18.4 billion workers compensation obligations, their $3.5 billion in accrued compensation and leave, $3.1 billion in prepaid postage, and $5.9 billion in other liabilities.

>The 15 billion debt is the DIRECT result of the 2006 mandate Congress passed for them to prefund the retiree healthcare plan. 

No it isn't, first off, the prefunding has been deferred in recent years, secondly the Post Office has been operating at a loss even after they were allowed to defer their payments. 2013 was the first year in a while that they operated with a net positive income, 2014's net income pre-payment was essentially break-even, and it's planned for FY2015 to have a half-billion loss.
