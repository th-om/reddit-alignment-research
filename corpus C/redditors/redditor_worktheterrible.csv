cvp6apu,1,t3_3nlr47,worktheterrible,"Yes, I agree. In the plain language of the second amendment, the people have a right to bear arms so that they can be drafted and fight in the army. The text doesn't say anything about guns for the purpose of self defense or enjoyment. The second amendment gives you the right to bear an arm if you might be qualified for the draft, and the  weapon would also have to be a proper one for that purpose. Otherwise, you don't actually have a right to bear arms.",-16,0,1444069929,1444717708

If a convicted murderer gets out of jail, we can protect society by not giving him a gun, while also helping him maintain his own quality of life.

I believe mentally ill people actually commit fewer acts of violence than mentally healthy people, on average. Maybe wanting to own a gun in an urban environment should be in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. (Joking on that one, but a lot of people who are against guns do consider those in favor to be bloodlusty asocial people.
