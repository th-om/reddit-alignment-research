I'm not trying to be rude, just saying I haven't heard anything that would convince me you need to work less hours.  And I think you're unlikely to win this argument - at least with an approach that sound almost ... childish. (again sorry, but that's what it reads as).  You'll need to frame the argument in how you both win from a change.  Would this give you time to exercise, cook healthier, care for others,  free up his time or do other things that could add value to your lives and justify the change?  ",32,0,1444530995,1444719293
cvvdtxu,1,t3_3oa8p3,jaasx,"There are many reasons to seek out a simple lifestyle.  Saving money, early retirement, using less resources, having more free time, etc.  Avoiding a painful coworker is a stretch imho if that is the driving concern.  I'd certainly push back on a spouse with that attitude.  Work sucks sometimes but you do it to reach your common goals.  Why not just let the guy fail.  Keep records of his failures and all the training you've given him.  And frankly, feel free to tell him you didn't want him back and that if he doesn't work this time he's likely going to be gone soon.  ",41,0,1444528211,1444719293

cvurgzn,1,t3_3o25ag,jaasx,"Here's what I want in a drafter I work with:  
a.) careful and thorough.  Don't just fly through it.  I don't care if takes you half as long as others if it isn't 100% right.  Do it once, do it right.  
b.) Understand GD&T.  Anyone can use the software, coming up with the best dimensioning scheme takes the talent.  
c.) It's helpful if you understand what the part is doing.  That helps part B above.  That's why experience is useful.  
d.) There are probably a few dozen (or hundreds) manufacturing standards (industry standards, company standards) you'll need to be familiar with to help design and detail the part.  The more of them you know the more useful you are.  
g.) There is definitely an art to performing stackups.  You can get try to excel at that.   
f.) Knowing the local processes - like how to make a FEA model for the analysis team and everything they need - is helpful.  I hate acting as a middle man trying to get everyone on board.  Take notes when you do one, ask the analysts what they need.  
e.) As an engineer I rely heavily on the drafter to know this stuff better than me, my time is better spent on engineering.  Some engineers love this stuff; I'm not one of them.  But I definitely appreciate a drafter who knows the job.  That gets them requested and that is their path to job security and promotion.",2,0,1444485345,1444719293
