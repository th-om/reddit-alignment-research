cvbn8px,1,t3_3m3hpa,admadsinbad,"I think there is a massive underestimation of the youth in this country. Young people are typically more liberal and have been seeing the GOP drop the ball on social issues/climate change/drugs time and time again. Though, voter turnout for the youth wasn't great before, I believe a shift has taken place. Another democrat is very likely, and if not, definitely shouldn't be discounted.

cumcfsc,0,t1_cumbflm,admadsinbad,">killing someone is the worst possible single action you can commit on another human being

You said this, and then went on to say how we should kill him... That's strange to me.

Also to elaborate on my stance, I personally don't believe that there are ""good"" people out there choosing to be murderers. I think that if you have the capacity to kill someone in cold blood, then something has gone very wrong for you. Either biologically or socially. I do then believe that an intelligent society would be more interested in learning why they kill, to prevent it in the future, rather than meaningless revenge. Not to mention how many waisted billions of dollars have gone to extending trials to find out if we should kill the person.",6,0,1441059701,1444724940
cumb0rl,0,t1_culwzt7,admadsinbad,"Same for me. Except what did it for me was the realization that many murderers didn't choose to be murderers. I think that people that are that messed up should be constantly helped and studied by professionals. Who knows, maybe one day we will be able to tell if a child is showing signs of being a murderer, and then maybe we could reverse it/treat it.",5,0,1441057456,1444724940
