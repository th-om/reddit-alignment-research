cvwu1gv,0,t1_cvwt621,specialpatrol,"Ok got it, in the code you have apply the translate of the robot before the rotate. Then you have the head rotating on it's spot and moving along the z axis. Now each time you ""move the robot"" you need to add robotX += 0.15 * cos(angle), and robotZ += 0.15 * sin(angle)

(Might be the other way round with tghe cos /sin)

cvwtew8,1,t3_3ofmz4,specialpatrol,"Just to be clear; your robot always moves forward/backward in the direction it's facing.

You have two values to accumulate; direction (deg), position (x,z).

Everytime you rotate, you add/sub from the rotation.

Everytime you move you add/sub to the position, in the direction of the current rotation.

Everytime you want to show the result, you recreate two matrices; a rotation about Y matrix, and a translation of the position matrix.

Your result matrix is rotation * position.",3,0,1444650016,1444717552

cvwrjhl,1,t3_3of371,specialpatrol,"I think its;

>glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, M->numIndices, M->indices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

shouldn't it be M->numIndices * sizeof(GLuint)?

instead of earlier you have:
