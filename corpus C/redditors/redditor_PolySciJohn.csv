I'm going to try to breakdown some aspects to the Iranian Nuclear deal. Not only as a citizen of the United States but as a citizen of the world, this deal will present the biggest threat not only to the United States but Israel and the rest of the western world. Taking the sanctions away that were put in place over 25 years ago has crippled Iran. Not to mention the President does not have the authority to solely take the sanctions away but of course our checks and balances system is a joke. But anyways by the deal going thru it gives Iran 100 Billion dollars to further fund their terroristic behavior as well as to continue to violate most human rights laws. The Obama administration claims that this deal will prevent a nuclear Iran but if you look at history and history loves to repeat itself in 1994 when Bill Clinton eased sanctions on North Korea despite the pleads our allies attempted to make he did it anyways. Within 6 years you had a nuclear ready North Korea. We have 4 American prisoners there that we WONT be getting back and not to mention the relief of sanctions would give relief to Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani, leader of the elite Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, who is a designated terrorist who is responsible for the deaths of at least 500 U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Not to mention we have them burning our flag and chanting ""Death to America"" and promise the destruction of Israel which is one of our closest allies in the region. So basically the United States will become the number 1 financier of Islamic terrorism in the word. ",2,0,1441864810,1444730840
