cvmu77s,1,t3_3ncnnq,agoody117,"I can only speak for myself. While the problems he speaks about are valid and real, I disagree with the solutions he proposes to these problems. 

For example the sky-rocketing cost of education problem he plans to solve by giving free education paid for by a tax on financial transactions. Two problems here: the fix for raising education costs won't come from shifting who pays for education but rather eliminating the incentives schools currently have to keep raising the price of admission. Second, a tax on every financial transaction raises the hurdle rate which means it's harder for capital to flow through the system. Projects that have a positive npv today won't happen tomorrow because the interest rate will change to account for the increased cost of financial transactions. With less capital flowing through the system growth stalls. Why do you think the fed has worked so hard to keep interest rates low? This isn't a grand mechanism of Wall Street either it's simply finance 101.",3,0,1443889438,1444719627

cupdaul,1,t3_3jht7s,agoody117,"I've done a similar hike to what another user posted. Beautiful area of the country, you should really be excited! We hung our food every night. There are bears in the area but I would be surprised if you saw one. Hanging the food is more for other critters that will chew threw your pack/tent to get to food. 

The escarptment trail isn't too challenging - it just depends on your fitness level of course. 

I did my hike in late fall, right around peak foliage weekend so the trails were empty. 

Just enjoy the area!",1,0,1441296343,1444719627
cujvseo,0,t1_cujvjh5,agoody117,"Thanks. I appreciate it. I unfortunately don't live anywhere close to Mountains...but I try and do one big trip a year. 

Last year it was the Four Pass Loop around the Maroon Bells in Colorado. Next year i'm thinking of doing about 40 miles of the John Muir Trail into Yosemite and exploring the park with a 2/3 day hike in Yosemite. 

Bucket list parks/hikes left to hit: Glacier, Wonderland, Denali, Yellowstone, Torres Del Paine, New Zealand, and Tour du Mont Blanc. ",2,0,1440869270,1444719627

cujtx3m,0,t1_cujs1lt,agoody117,"Sure. How much detail are you looking for? 

Day 1: TH to Hannegan - 4 Miles
We started on the Hannegan Trail on Saturday August 15th about 4PM. We hiked about 4 miles to Hannegan Camp. This campsite does not require permits which made it quite full. Not a lot of places to hang a bear bag here either.

Day 2: Hannegan to Tapto Lakes - 15ish miles
We woke up early knowing we had a long day a head of us. From Hannegan camp you head up to Hannegan Pass relatively quickly before heading straight down into the valley on the Chilliwack Trail. Beautiful lush mossy forest was how I would describe this trail. We passed a Park Ranger on horseback at Copper Creek Campsite. Once we passed US Cabin campsite we reached the Cable Car. It was pretty neat to cross a river using this thing - pretty safe too. We had lunch at the trail junction of Brush Creek Trail. Until Graybeal campsite it's pretty flat and there is evidence of a significant flash flood. After Graybeal its switchbacks and uphill until Whatcom Pass (and Tapto Lakes). We passed trail crew working on the trail and another ranger who was friendly. After a tiring slog up to Whatcom Pass we found the 'trail' to Tapto Lakes. This 'trail' was easy to find but definitely deceivingly tough especially after a 14 mile day. I found myself thinking just one more ridge only to find we had to keep going up. As we descended into Tapto we knew we had the whole place to ourselves. We were exhausted, hungry, and dehydrated so we quickly set up camp and made dinner and fell asleep while it was still light out. 

Day 3: Tapto Lakes / Red Face Mountain - 5 Miles
We slept in and awoke to a clear blue sky day and explored the Tapto Lakes area. We decided to make for the ridge of Red Face via heading up the east face. Pretty easy and straight forward despite no trail. From the ridge we ate lunch and had awesome views of Challenger, Shuskhan, and Indian Mountain. We broke camp around 3 and headed back down to the Graybeal Camp. Again, significant signs of a flash flood in this area but the campsite worked. We ate dinner with two other groups one who had been on the PCT since early July and another solo hiker doing the loop via Ross Lake. 

Day 4: Graybeal to Copper Lake: 13.5 Miles
Another long day. We quickly got to the river crossing which was fun because of the Sockeye Salmon. It was actually two river crossings so we had to take our boots off twice.. whoops. It took a bit to find the trail again but once we did it was all uphill until Copper Lake. Ugh. The switchbacks were long but a constant uphill. About half way up the switchbacks we could make out a helicopter flying extremely low above the Chilliwack River and we weren't too sure what they were looking for. After the switchbacks the trail continues to ascend but the views start to become incredible. We ran into and startled a black bear which was about 20ft away. He scurried down into the valley. The Copper Lake campsite was already full so we grabbed a spot down closer to the lake (we had permits.. not sure how it was full). People were swimming in the lake and we did jump in quickly which felt refreshing after the long and hot day. We had an awesome view of the sunset overlooking Mt. Redoubt and we just sat there until the stars came out. 

Day 2: Copper Lake to Hannegan: 8 Miles
We slept in again to another picture perfect day. From Copper Lake it was uphill for another 45-60 mins before hitting the spin of the ridge. The ridge was incredible and had amazing views to the West. We rested at the lookout and chatted with a hiker who talked about a bear near Egg Lake the night before. We ate lunch at Silesia campsite which we both thought had awesome views and is the premier campsite on the ridge. Once we hit boundary camp we rested and refilled water since there werent that many spots to get water along the ridge (unless you descend to Egg Lake). We spotted a bear print on the trail here which confirmed a lot of other hikers talk about seeing a bear in this area. We nabbed the highest site at Hannegan which was private and had awesome views of Ruth Mountain and it's glacier and just had a relaxing evening. The next morning was a quick walk out. 

Perfect hike, perfect weather, not many people on the trail. 10/10 hike. Really is a gem. ",3,0,1440865715,1444719627
