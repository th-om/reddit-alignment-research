cvxrh9b,1,t3_3oj7if,NarrowLightbulb,"First of all, as a Bernie supporter I'd like to say that Hillary is an experienced debater and that there is no definite winner yet. Just felt I needed to say that to counteract the anti-circle jerk circle jerk.

For Hillary to be considered the winner she'd have to come out looking confident in the wakes of the criticism she will undoubtedly receive as the front-runner while staying relatively positive towards her opponents. She can't give the media anything to bite on. It shouldn't be too hard because my guess is that this debate won't be very aggressive but at the same time I'm not sure what to expect from candidates like O'Malley and Webb who have nothing to lose. As for Bernie, I see him being more focused on introducing himself and his ideas rather than on the offense. Overall, Hillary will hold her numbers fine while Bernie and O'Malley may gain some, moreso Bernie. Webb and Chafee will dropout by the end of the year.

cvxpop8,0,t1_cvxoki1,NarrowLightbulb,"Simply put Social Democrats advocate a capitalist or mixed system that is kept in check with heavy regulation, social provision and welfare while Democratic Socialists advocate the idea that the people control the means of production in a democratic form. 

You only ever hear Bernie speak and act really on bettering our system through regulation and programs, and although at heart he may really believe he's a Democratic Socialist, he acts as a Social Democrat.


I'm no professor in economics or politics, but just take a look at the definitions and you can see for yourself.

cvxikum,1,t3_3oii7n,NarrowLightbulb,"Despite the fact that that's what he calls himself, I think it's relative to US politics more than anything. A democratic socialist in the American political system is basically an actual Social Democrat, at least in Bernie's instance.
