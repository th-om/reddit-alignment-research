While the ""rich"" as a group do pay a larger percentage than the ""not rich"", they still do not pay enough proportional to their level of income. But that has nothing to do with this specific plan. Sen. Sanders' plan is a transaction tax on high frequency trading. That is not ""taxing the rich at 100%, it is taxing the large players in the stock market who currently pay <20% rate on capitol gains.

For example: you say free college is not economically feasible. I'm assuming you have an economics degree? If not that will need a supported source. You said making colleges free will ""destroy colleges due to lack of funding""; again you can't just feed us bullshit without backing it up with...wait for it.....a source!!",1,0,1443566345,1444722795
