cvup2yl,0,t1_cvuaylk,harkonnenjr,"No.  There are more than 100 eggs, the more eggs you buy the more there are, because people making eggs take your money to make more eggs. So printing money always helps.  It does not help in an economy where production cannot match demand due to resource or technology limitations, but usually we manage to do it.  Also, there is almost always a surplus of products on the market, with few exceptions.  That is why everyone is trying to sell you shit. It also helps if the money you print is dollars, the world's currency.  That is why America is never really in crisis. ",1,0,1444477465,1444729589
cv0aibl,0,t1_cv020et,harkonnenjr,His policies will help African-American communities the most.  It is time for for black communities to follow their own interest and not the stupid Jesus freaks they have in common with evangelicals.  Hopefully both poor blacks and whites will come to realize the political class and the rich that bough it duped us all for too long.,-8,0,1442171152,1444729589

culbfer,0,t1_culazhc,harkonnenjr,"It's funny how we are debating on two fronts. :)  May I suggest you source your meat elsewhere, maybe free range chicken or fish, or pigs raised on organic farms and killed humanely.  Even consider becoming a vegetarian.  Leave deer alone.  Solve the pest problem by introducing the beautiful wolf into the habitat.  You did give me something to think about.  It may be that hunting for food is more ethical than factory farming, but it's simply not sustainable with current population levels.  Maybe we both have to start distributing condoms.",1,0,1440982295,1444729589
culazy3,0,t1_culaelv,harkonnenjr,"You are getting closer.  I wish actual politicians showed the same common sense when debating the issue.  The sad truth is NRA political influence will make compromise impossible and that's just the current state of facts.  Another state of facts is, as you mentioned, the number of guns in circulation and how difficult would be to control guns that have already been purchased and stored.  I still don't see the problem with a gun registry, I will concede to a non-renewable license.  A new gun owner license should be required, though.  You say everyone should know how to handle a gun.  I disagree.  There are people like me who live in safe neighborhoods (which by the way are becoming safer and safer - see [this book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/1491518243) ) who will never want or need to use a gun.  Let's require training from the people that want and need to use a gun - hence the requirement for an initial license.  The gun show loophole can be easily closed by requiring private sellers to ask for a gun license (assuming they don't have internet access in the middle of a Kentucky state fair).  As you can see, I'm not totally unreasonable.  I still wish all guns disappeared from the face of the Earth and still think that would make a better planet, but while I may be an idealist, I'm not completely outside reality.   Too bad his debate is never had in public, or in forums that matter such as the House and Senate.  ",1,0,1440981433,1444729589
