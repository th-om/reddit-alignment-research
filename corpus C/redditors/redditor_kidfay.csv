Maybe after a while you will find a desire to start doing friend things with him again, maybe never. Either way, it's fine. Maybe tell him things need to 'cool off' for a while.",4,0,1444584798,1444732314
cvt4qm5,1,t3_3nzw9r,kidfay,"Condensation happens when the surface of an object is colder than the dew point temperature. The dew point temperature is almost always lower than the air temperature. 100% humidity or fog is when they are the same. Weather forecasts often include the dew point temperature.

Assuming you like your drinks liquid, all you'd have to do to not get condensation would be to take your drink outside on a day when the air temperature is below freezing and you won't get condensation.

There's virtually no moisture in winter air (I'm from Illinois where it snows and turns to tundra) whereas when the dew point is in the 70's F, the muggiest air in the summer, the air can be over 3% water vapor. If it's cold enough outside and your house has enough air exchange/leaks, your house might not be able to retain very much water vapor so the dew point in your house would trend toward that of the outside air and be even be lower than the temperature of your refrigerator. Then you wouldn't get condensation on drinks indoors either. I don't particularly recall condensation on drinks in winter. Even now in October, cans of soda only get slightly damp and the dew point outside is mid-50's today.",2,0,1444349443,1444732314
cvsmkq9,1,t3_3nv4z7,kidfay,There's a thing where people get so deep into an ideology that they lose basing things in reality. This reminds me about there being a thing in the USSR in Stalin times that they tried planting wads of seeds together and expected a good crop because the seeds would work collectively unlike capitalist seeds that would choke each other out I guess. Obviously the seeds weren't communal and the yield was very low.,2,0,1444321736,1444732314
cvr6zx6,1,t3_3nsnzx,kidfay,"I work for a utility company. There are 4 main levels of engineer and a 5th of which there are only a handful and I think typically it's engineers at the nuke plant that reach that level.

After the 4th step, you'd have to interview and take a job at your supervisor's level to get your next bump up at the supervising engineer position which is the first level of supervising other engineers. Supervising engineers still do engineering but not as much, mainly lots of meetings and committees although engineers frequently participate in that stuff too. (Then depending on group in the company there might be 0-2 more layers of engineer bosses before you get to a director, then a senior director, then VP.)

These four steps are same position just promotions with changes in title and pay. The increases in the center of the pay bands are 10-15k steps. As far as I know all management engineers have these same steps whether electric, gas, transmission, substation, etc. (We have union ""engineers"" but that's entirely different.) Your bosses do have to justify promoting you to HR and HR rules with angry little iron fists. Engineers starting fresh out of school come in as the first level. Then if you do a good job over time gets you to levels 2 and 3 without much hassle. (I think they said level 3 can happen starting in year 7. They were telling me last week I'm doing a good job and dropping hints.) Getting to the 4th step requires a ""business need"" and usually you also need to have your PE by that point.

There's tons of personal and professional development and training the company offers, like leadership programs and various classes and so on, arranging and giving experiences to people. The engineers are the pool of future higher level people.

My first job was at a small company, ~45 people, mostly engineers. There was no structure and no development. They definitely saw us as interchangeable, if they even saw us as people. The ""ranking"" system was based on cliques. At the time I thought it was an ok job--it was my first engineering job and I got it during the recession--but looking back now that place was horrible and toxic.",2,0,1444221606,1444732314

cvnv9mn,1,t3_3nfa0d,kidfay,"American mute buttons get pressed a lot. Per hour we get 42 minutes of tv. Longer movies take 4-5 hours to play on tv. At American football games there's a referee on the field who calls pauses to fit commercials in on the broadcast. Shows are compressed and [sped up](http://www.wsj.com/articles/cable-tv-shows-are-sped-up-to-squeeze-in-more-ads-1424301320) to fit more commercials (radio does that too with songs).

The trick is the last commercial is usually a self-promotion ad for the network so in SNL's case, another NBC show or NBC news.

On the other hand, you can get up and go to the bathroom or get a drink and not miss anything.

When I watched Monty Python for the first time, part of what made it amazing was that it's continuous for half an hour! A lot of jokes stem from transitions and how they bridge between them. Mr. Show was continuous too since it was on HBO.

In SNL I've only ever seen 1-2 times in the last 10-15 years where they've directly transitioned between sketches. I want to say Wiig got up from the ending sketch and the camera followed her walking to the next sketch where that started. It was nuts.

It works to SNL's disadvantage. Like I said, Monty Python got humor from the nonsense bridging two sketches. SNL on the other hand has 5 minute or whatever long blocks to fill. If they get 2 minutes of good stuff, they have to stretch it out or they could get another 2 minute sketch but they're limited in space. Their studio was originally built for a radio orchestra. From what I've found the whole studio room is about 130 x 80 x 30 feet. A high school basketball court is 84 x 50 so it's 50% wider and longer than a basketball court.

When I was in the UK, it was cool you still have radio 'channels' and interesting radio shows that play different music. Here I'm pretty sure most stations are software cycling through short lists of songs. NPR is still good but it's listener supported. PBS is the equivalent TV network but their biggest hits are Sesame Street, Mr. Rodgers, and broadcasting Downton Abbey in the US.

You know the difference is in the US, everything is ad supported while in the UK you have to pay for licenses to support the BBC on tv and radio. That means in the US their incentive is to squeeze as many ads in as possible while in the UK they have to keep the audience happy.",0,0,1443975171,1444732314
cvnbkor,1,t3_3ndslb,kidfay,"I'm turning 29 soon so I'm an old fart. I went through something similar that started in the middle of high school and got worse until the 2nd year of college when I realized I could barely talk in class or go to the grocery store and I had to change things.

An important thing to realize is that feelings are feelings. They don't make sense and there aren't reasons behind them--if there were then they wouldn't be 'feelings'. Feelings are signals from your body. Our bodies can be real dumb sometimes and too sensitive or sending the wrong signal. It was very helpful to me to realize that ""I"" am separate from my feelings and for whatever reason they had gotten mis-calibrated so they were sending me wrong signals.

There are two directions to work on. The first is to identify unhelpful/bad thought patterns and then make a habit of stopping them as soon as you realize you're doing one of them. Eventually you break the habit of the thought pattern. [Here's a list.](http://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/) I'm particularly bad with ""all or nothing"" thinking. An example would be someone says something negative about me and then the next thing I know I have a feeling of despair like no one could ever possibly love me and I'm going to die alone. This is not realistic at all and any other person wouldn't have made such a connection. I also sometimes ask myself ""what's the worst that can happen?"" or ""will this matter in 20 years?"" when I'm going down a negative path or feel anxiety building.

The other is that your feelings and you operate based on the pool of your past experiences. If every time you talk to someone they react negatively, then you form the idea going into talking to people that it's going to be negative. If you start having new positive experiences after a few you'll start to not expect negative reactions. I had social anxiety issues too. I did little experiments like going to the store and doing something different, or riding the bus, or saying ""hi"" to people. I'd get the swell of anxiety but there wasn't the negative reaction like my feelings had been anticipating so after going a little bit farther each experiment and not getting a negative reaction, the tension right before dissipated.

My parents are incredibly judgmental and critical of everything. Even just driving around as they go through some town they talk about all the things wrong with it and how bad the people are and other bad aspects of it and how glad they are that they don't live there and so on. I had internalized that thinking and got into the habit of doing it myself. One day in college I was in the car with my roommate and reflexively commented on a pedestrian and there was silence and the glance he gave me just shattered it. So working on avoiding being like my parents I put effort into seeing people as fellow humans and not judging and it took a year or two to get out of the habit but it's been great to be in the moment and not judging. And then I also know at the least, I'm a better person than my parents.

As an older person, I did a year of therapy and medication a couple of years ago. Medication turned down the volume of my brain and made me sleep like a log. It was good that I realized I could exist and function without having to pay attention to all the random thoughts, like that I wasn't missing something. And I got to experience what that's like but then I was increasingly wondering what's me and what's the medication and so on. The downside is I gained a bunch of weight. Anti-depression medication works on the same pathways as the food-hunger-stomach-brain path. But all in all it was a step forward. Therapy can be helpful. I got to spill my guts. After a few months it started to feel like I was saying the same things over and over which was dumb. For me those things then fell away. So I guess that worked too.

I'd strongly recommend getting into exercise over medication or therapy. Even just going for a half hour walk every other day makes a huge difference. You'll likely find you enjoy it and you'll start looking forward to it and missing it when you don't do it. It gives you a little accomplishment too.

The other big thing is getting around a good group of people. At a previous job, the social people tended to shit on me all the time. I'm an easy punching bag. It was a negative situation and the company was going sideways or downward so no one was happy. At my new job, I fit in and in the role perfectly and everyone is nice and I love the work. It's totally like night and day. You wouldn't believe how much of a difference such a change can make. And as an INFP I've found that to be happy I need to be contributing to something big. Looking back at it, school up through high school was most unpleasant. Kids are brutal, bored, and forced together for 7 hours per day and hate it and take it out on each other.

cvn2mke,1,t3_3ncjqw,kidfay,"A story is the author's 'evidence' to support a thesis (the theme or moral). The characters demonstrate the thesis through the plot. You can write the plot and characters first and let the thesis emerge and then revise and refine to tighten it up.

The thesis doesn't have to be something big or ground breaking. It can be something simple like 'you can always count on friends' or something about love or 'be careful what you wish for' or 'people build meaning from their work' or 'playing sports shapes people' or even 'high school was crap'. It could be something like 'the childhood vacations to my family's lake house shaped me as an adult' if you're writing 1st person. Charles Dickens' themes were as simple as 'poverty is bad and people are victims of it'. Whatever you pick, it's the deep meaning that the story carries.
