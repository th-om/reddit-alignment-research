cvxfqaw,0,t1_cvxe68q,Zeydon,"True.  Though there's a third camp as well, that says ""since we can't decide unanimously whether to prioritize fetus over mother or vis versa, it seems best to leave the decision in the hands of the person making the decision instead of the state.""  This perspective is part of the pro-choice coalition, but it reaches it's conclusion by trying to distance itself from the mother vs fetus issue, which doesn't seem possible to resolve.  Of course, those who hold that stance may not be any less emotional than the other two.  And perhaps there's more arguments on the pro-life side than the ""save the fetus"" stance, of which I'm unaware of: you'd have to enlighten me as to what that would be.",2,0,1444687846,1444727048
