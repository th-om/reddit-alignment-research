That's not an example of the law failing, she would have received her permit. That's like saying speed limit laws failed because someone was going the speed limit and died in a car accident.

An example of the law failing would be someone who should have been able to receive a firearm was denied.",1,0,1443888049,1444719967

cvlh0a2,1,t3_3n6n1p,Reptilian_Overlords,"Violence itself isn't curbed by laws, laws are crafted to shape the statistical likeliness of an event occurring, an example is that banning lead in gasoline statistically results in less exposure to lead in gasoline side effects.

What people who say ""gun control doesn't work"" fail to realize is that on its face the fact that even just one time that an individual who wanted a firearm but was denied meant the law worked.

What they really mean is ""I don't want to go through the process so that others aren't exposed to a higher chance of being a victim of gun violence, because it's convoluted, etc etc""

It's the same response to laws banning illegal dumping: ""well I don't want to properly dispose of my trash, so I'll just dump it on the side of the road because it's easier, etc etc"".

A law by itself will not completely stop issues, it just sets up a process of introducing accountability.",3,0,1443773030,1444719967
