cvs8uho,1,t3_3nxn26,Brownbacked,"Often we vote, and debate here, as if the candidate's platform is how it will be the day immediately following the inauguration. Being realists, aka small business owners, we know change takes time and intelligent compromise, very little of which we've seen in deadlocked DC. Sanders' years in the trenches of Washington will serve us well to help drive bills to the floor. Without the backroom pork riders and BS back pats for lunch, Sanders has nothing to lose and no lies to hide. He has no reason to not demand transparency of mega-corporate graft, repeal of mega-corp subsidies, efficiency in the military. All of which benefits small business in competition with protected multinationals. First, he has to get that TPP into surgery to ensure small businesses retain well-earned commercial leverage.",2,0,1444286887,1444722675
cvs5lg2,0,t1_cvrfj9l,Brownbacked,"How will his youthful ""wanderlust"" give him a better chance at full-time employment in Iran? His new language and social skills? A type of hands-on entrepreneurship? Learning from failure and spending too much money on a dangerous vacation? His courage to leave the nest and take a stand against the huge economic disadvantages a family, and nation, can face due to immobile, family dependent 30+ year old men. To me, all these things sound like excellent experience for a young man; curious how Iran views the benefit of his experience.

Also, looking forward 10 years, when this Traveler will be starting toward the height of economic productivity, is anyone talking or writing about the proposition that control and opportunity in the Iranian economy be divided between 1) those men (and families) who are well-positioned to benefit today (as the Russian Oligarchs were well-positioned in their society in 1991), and 2) an educated labor class of men (and women to a lesser extent) who will be economically and socially restricted? That is, restricted to less than full-time employment or underemployment in bureaucracy services (not the southern fields for which others suggest they are ill-suited/elitist); and restricted from creating and sustaining a family life typically associated with stability (happiness) in Iran?

Any implication on my part that US nexus personnel would define probable cause rather than encounter it as part of following official procedure is misleading. Not cool, again.

cvrxcxu,0,t1_cvrvkv4,Brownbacked,"tl:dr True, internet privacy is a fallacy and all your data is available to anyone at anytime, but for now we're focusing on the border agent gauntlet. You must be prepared to hand over your phone just as you are prepared to hand over your laptops and tablets to be checked and dissected.You have nothing to hide, but if the border patrol agents can't figure that out, it may make you nervous. You will be less nervous if the agents don't even have a way to see anything but cute on your phone. Perhaps I am overly dramatic about 'erasing' everything, but I am trying to make you terribly nervous now so you won't be then.

Think of it like this: In the thin strip of surreality we call the border, DHS et alia can search inside and outside your naked body and everything attached to it while defining probable cause for removing from you...all but your life.

Let's role play:


Border Patrol agent: Let me see your phone.


You: No.


Border Patrol agent: What did you say?


You: No.


Border Patrol agent: I'll ask one more time, sir. Let me see your phone.


You: No.


Border Patrol agent: Step aside sir. 


 -- Security-looking type personnel surround you. Everyone looks away (no witnesses). And you just disappear, if you're lucky.


Moral - the border is no place to stage the farce we call ""fight for your rights.""


Alternate ending:


Border Patrol agent: Let me see your phone.


You: Sure. Here ya' go.


Border Patrol agent: Unlock the screen.


You: Sure.


1st Border Patrol agent hands a 2nd border patrol agent your phone.


2nd border patrol agent tries to take off the thick ruff-neck case. 


2nd border patrol agent, frustrated: No drugs? 


You: No.


2nd border patrol agent: So I don't have to take this thing off and pull out the battery?


You: No. (Looking at him directly, softly in the eyes imbuing him with truth and confidence in you.)


2nd border patrol agent scrolls thru your screens. May be checks last phone calls made, last texts sent. May be not.


2nd border patrol agent handing you back your phone: Here ya go.


 --You step out of immigration, into the US, all your clothing properly arranged with phone in hand. Yeah USA!
