Pregnancy is one of the most dangerous things a woman can endure. There are chances of several life ending complications occurring in the nearly 10 months of a full term pregnancy. 

At what point does the woman's life become less important than a fertilized egg? 

It's difficult for some people to understand the variables regarding pregnancy and the difficult decisions a person faces when burdened with that situation. 

I want nothing more than for there to be fewer abortions in the world. The only thing that will bring that to fruition is reliable healthcare for everyone and honest factual conversations about pregnancy prevention across the board. Even then some abortion decisions are medical in nature and cannot be avoided.

OP is part of this family or plans on being one some day. She obviously can't just make them better parents. She can't fix the situation by just avoiding or ignoring. It needs to come to a head and be discussed like adults. Do you not agree? As a nanny and older sibling I'm sure your aware that kids change and learn constantly and he will soon figure out hitting isn't cool either by his parents finally learning how to parent or by getting into trouble some other way. 

He's not even the real issue here. The real issue is the relationship with the SO's family and being able to communicate with them effectively without alienating them. If she feels comfortable eventually marrying into the family she should feel comfortable talking to them about this issue.

cvx6cs1,0,t1_cvx5p36,offbeatchicken,"I have 3 kids and more than 10 nieces and nephews. I'm not an expert on everything but I know kids pretty well. They're all different and what works for one doesn't always work for another. There's a huge learning curve. 

There could be several reasons why they had to ditch the wedding. Does that make them bad people automatically, I don't think so. OP expressed her love for this family, so I doubt they are awful. They are new parents and finding their way. We don't always get it right the first time around. 

The boy is 2. What kind of punishment do you expect them to give him? A time out is appropriate, but perhaps they are not enforcing the rules effectively. Physically punishing him will only perpetuate the behavior. 

I am only suggesting that she have an open family conversation about this issue. She needs to tell his family that sometimes the kids aggressive behavior makes her feel uncomfortable, and she wants to talk about it, but in a kind way so they don't feel like their parenting is being attacked.  Have you ever heard of the ""terrible twos""... it's real, it's a power struggle. And it's a bitch. ",-8,0,1444674221,1444719106
cvx5gw0,0,t1_cvx56wt,offbeatchicken,I understand not wanting to be around an aggressive kid. I really do. I would hate for this to become a rift in your relationship with your SO's family. Parenting is really hard and sometimes you get blinded by the love you have for your child and can't see the negatives. Sometimes as a new parent you just don't know how to handle the situation yet. Give him a chance. Everything about kids is temporary. He will change. Good luck. ,-7,0,1444672947,1444719106
cvx5asz,0,t1_cvx41iu,offbeatchicken,"While I agree that his behavior is not appropriate and that they shouldn't force her to have a relationship with him, OP is not handling the situation very well. The boy is very young. He is still learning, and so are his parents.  To write him off as a brat and the parents off as terrible is not helping her situation at all. This will create a huge issue with the family eventually if she doesn't do something more active to fix it with them instead of avoiding them or complaining to her SO.  If she really does truly feel connected to his family she needs to talk directly to them about this. ",-11,0,1444672704,1444719106
cvx3naj,1,t3_3ogaiw,offbeatchicken,"I think there are a few issues here that I feel need to be addressed. This is coming from a parent and as an aunt.

First, keep in mind that this kid is only 2, Boys at that age are not unknown to be a little rough around the edges. Does that mean it's okay to purposefully harm you, no of course not. When he apologizes to you do not say ""it's okay"". Say ""thank you for apologizing"". It's important for him to know that what he did hurt you. Kids his age are only beginning to understand emotions and it's okay to show him that you are ""hurt"" or ""sad"" that he did that to you. It's the only way he will learn that hitting and biting are not okay. I think you need to start an open conversation with his family about how they want you to react to him and if they are comfortable with you being more direct with him when he hurts you. I fully expect my family to treat my kids as they would their own. If they do something wrong I expect them to tell my kid their being a jerk and to knock it off. We are family, not strangers. Raising kids takes a village. 

Secondly, you have for the most part you have decided to be a part of this family. If you are actively avoiding the kid when he is around, I guarantee that your SO's family can tell. If they are handing him to you they are trying to create a relationship between you. If you were a parent it would make you feel terrible if they avoided your child at all costs. Stop trying to avoid him. Get down in his level. Ask him questions and talk to him. Play with him. Do what he wants to do for just 20 minutes and you will create a connection. There's no doubt in my mind that he can sense your reluctance to be close to him. If you give him just a little bit of yourself it will be beneficial to both of you. It's sad for me to read how much you adore your sisters kids and then describe how much you hate your SO's nephew. He may not be the most well behaved kid, but his family loves him. 

Lastly. Are you planning on ever having children? I'm just wondering if maybe your future in-laws are wondering about that issue and that's why their so adamant about handing the kid off to you. Maybe they're trying to invoke some weird baby fever reactions. They obviously love their grandkids, and probably are hoping for confirmation that you are thinking about giving them more. Maybe not right now, or soon, but eventually.  


NOTE : I feel like this will be the last thread in this sub I comment on regarding children. It seems like no one here (or very few) has any real life experience with kids other than to hate them from a distance and any advice at all about how to work with them in a meaningful way gets nothing but negativity. I care about people big and tiny and that's why I'm here, to maybe help people see a side that they were unwilling to see before. But no one here appreciates that type of advice for some reason and its beyond frustrating. We were all kids once, what if no one gave you a chance?
