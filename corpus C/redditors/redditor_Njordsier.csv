cuclndv,0,t1_cuc7szy,Njordsier,"It's like a free to play game. Sure, you have the option of playing responsibly and not giving too much of your money. But it is crafted to exploit the imperfect cognitive machinery that gets us to think, ""so you're telling me there's a chance?"" or, ""I need gratification now rather than later,"" to get you to spend as much money as you can. The state wants you to be that person who wastes a hundred dollars every week on the lottery, just like how free to play game developers and casinos alike target the ""whales:"" the most irresponsible consumers of the product. And they put every psychological trick they can into the process to get more people to that whale status, or else to take the whales they have and milk them for all they're worth. And as fun as they might make it, just as many free to play games are fun, it is still exploitation. And it becomes a serious problem if the people most vulnerable to that exploitation are the ones least able to afford it (i.e. children for free to play games, poor adults for lotteries). And in situations like this, yes, it can be argued that is the responsibility of the consumer to not spend more than they should, but I do fault the designer for banking on people being irresponsible.

cucl80i,0,t1_cuc6xxu,Njordsier,"There are ten million reasons you can't be this person. One for each other person who buys a ticket. You have to randomly be singled out from an unfathomably large crowd.

One dollar a week is still 52 dollars per year. Or 1400 dollars in 20 years. And in all that time, your chances of winning are still miniscule. The expected value of return rounds down to zero. What if you took that 1400 dollars and invested it instead? You will get a much higher return and with much greater confidence. 

That's not to say you're running your life over this, but really, the math plain does not work out for people who participate in the lottery. If it did, states wouldn't use them for revenue. 

I sometimes wonder if there's a mathematical way to model a lottery such that it can be considered rational to play in the lottery within reason, maybe by delinearizing the value function of money so that a single dollar spent is valued at less than a dollar lost, and a million gained at once is worth more than a million payed out in installments. I haven't figured out a way to formalize it in a way that is consistent with intuitive behavior (I am a computer scientist, not an economist), but even if I did, I doubt I could every manage to mathematically justify spending money that regularly on that money times a million divided by a hundred million.
