cvxjvg3,0,t1_cvxdosg,RedditAccountReboot,Supreme Court justices become more liberal as they age. You're likely going to need about 3 justices to retire. And then be able to ram through the approval of someone who is on the back side of public opinion. Very unlikely. ,1,0,1444694550,1444731476
cvxjs7x,0,t1_cvxafea,RedditAccountReboot,"Yeah. It isn't so much an issue. It's more that candidates are grandstanding for a certain voting bloc. They can't do anything about it. They know they can't do anything about it. But pretending you're going to do something about it, peaks the interest of a certain segment that shows up to the polls religiously.

cvxitw7,0,t1_cvxhu4c,RedditAccountReboot,"The point of the ""then he won Iowa and nearly New Hampshire"" is that those weren't his target markets. The demos in those states do not match up with with who Obama naturally appealed to. They're nearly completely white, far left states in the grand scheme of the primaries. Him winning Iowa and almost New Hampshire proved he could win across the board as a black man, not that he wasn't previously a viable candidate. Bernie Sanders winning Iowa and/or New Hampshire doesn't prove anything. Bernie Sanders winning South Carolina, would be the analogy to the Obama Iowa win. ",2,0,1444692828,1444731476

cvx7oca,0,t1_cvx3vr9,RedditAccountReboot,"Hilary is infinitely more seasoned of a debater and politician than Rick Perry. She's been front and center for over a decade and shared the limelight for 25 years. The lady can handle herself in a debate. Especially when she's approaching a debate as a ""just don't fuck this up"" strategy. ",8,0,1444676128,1444731476

cvx6luz,0,t1_cvx61rn,RedditAccountReboot,"Obama went to South Carolina in 2007 and 30,000 showed up. Bernie went and got 10,000. You could play this back and forth game all day. Bernie and Obama are completely different candidates that are in completely different situations.

cvx6cv7,0,t1_cvwz04n,RedditAccountReboot,"Republicans are in a weird quagmire there as well, because nobody is willing to hand out endorsements. You may not see a considerable move in the endorsement primary until December or post-Iowa. Several very strong establishment candidates have folks gun shy it seems. ",2,0,1444674225,1444731476
