The sample size includes multiple nations broken done by said groups on a few different topics related to Sharia law. That's not actually the specific one I was referring to, but that one took about three seconds to Google, and as I said, it illustrates the point pretty well.

The problem with the Beanie Babies is that they were created for that sole purpose in a large quantity.
