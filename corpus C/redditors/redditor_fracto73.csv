cvsr82y,1,t3_3nxo8i,fracto73,"Here is a brief summary of a campaign I ran, I was young and it is a little clichÃ© and forced:

**Background:**

Powerful Chaotic Good outsider knows of a location that is rich in resources (Gold, gems, hand-wavium, etc) in a hotly contested area bordered by powerful and unfriendly, but not out right hostile, nations. 

Through some vision/prophesy/time travel mechanism this outsider comes to learn that once these resources are discovered there will be a brutal war between all of these surrounding countries that will last generations.

The outsider came to the conclusion that powerful ageless guardian in the area would prevent any from claiming the site and stop a lot of death.

There is a powerless and ineffectual evil cult with a focus on undeath and hopes to one day awaken a dracolich. The BBGG secretly helps the cult to procure items to create the dracolich Knowing that this creature will claim the valuable land as his own and hunker down. The beast will utterly destroy any army moving in with his own undead army, which will only grow with each failed attempt to defeat it. Eventually an equilibrium will be reached and people will stop venturing into that area in force (adventurers will still do it, obviously). The undead will not move too far from their master and he won't leave the treasure/valuable lands, so the only threat is from those who choose to face it.

Many will die in this plan, but that number will be less than the amount that would have if these nations battled each other.


**Game play**

The players were called in because of the theft of a dragon skeleton. This lead them to the cult. After a few encounters they realized the cult was far out of it's depth and began looking for something behind the scenes. They eventually tracked down the outsider (in my case it was a profit). They talked with him, didn't fight, and he tried very hard to convince them that this was the greater good, and that by doing nothing he was dooming so many to death and war.

The party almost convinces him that he was out of line, that he could instead change the future by trusting heroes with the mission of keeping the peace and far fewer people would have to die. He agrees to take a step back and not interfere any further, but he won't help the party stop the events that have been set in motion. Players save the day without the help of too-powerful-to-be-fun NPC.",1,0,1444328495,1444721388
cvrob1c,0,t1_cvrnzjb,fracto73,"> Stop trying to parse it.  It is a simple equation: Is written authorization provided? If yes, firearms are allowed for the person authorize. ELSE authorization = NO

I agree with that, just like with a person driving, and if a person told me they were driving I would not assume they were doing so without authorization.

> When presented with evidence contradicting your opinion, you ignore it.

The only evidence here suggests that before the shootings there was a process to go through, not a ban. You assume that this person didn't go through that process and was violating the rules. I assume that he went through the process and was not violating the rules.

cvrnje0,0,t1_cvrmn6h,fracto73,"Neither of us attend that school or have tried to carry on that campus. I come to my opinion by listening to someone who has attended classes and carried on campus. I have no reason to think he was violating the rules. He seemed to be a responsible person who had gotten his CCW license and was aware of the rights and obligations that went along with that. When he was specifically asked about a gun ban he didn't know what the interviewer was talking about. 

You seem to be saying that a thing is banned if there is paperwork involved, which I disagree with. There are many things in this world that are allowed after filling out forms. That the rules allow for authorization and don't prohibit firearms seems to indicate that is the case here. This students response also indicates that there isn't a ban.

To think this is a ban you must believe that they wrote in a process for students to carry instead of a ban even though they wanted a ban. Then you would have to believe that this student being interviewed is indifferent to the rules, which I don't believe because he followed the states rules for getting his CCW, and a liar (since he said didn't know about the policy) or that he doesn't bother to know the policies of places he frequents, which would be out of character for anyone I know who has gotten a CCW. My judgment of this guy's character could be off, but I am not going to assume he is negligent or dishonest. I am also willing to put his word on this matter, as someone who lived with these rules, above the words of some guy on the internet.

cvrmpmn,0,t1_cvrlvgz,fracto73,"> Show me where written authorization is needed for either.

The library webpage does give some details on how to apply for a library card. Library cards are issued by libraries and authorize people to borrow books. If you don't go through the designated process to borrow a book, and instead walk out the door with it, that is stealing and the law has several punishments for that. If you don't want to violate the law, you need authorization in the form of a library card.

>Key words ""written authorization"" - a requirement that provides exception to the rule, not a blanket approval.

That isn't a ban. Driving without a license is punished. There is no blanket approval for driving on public roads. Is driving banned?",-1,0,1444246541,1444721388

If you can show something saying that licenses are issued for those activities, then I guess it would be legal near you.

You have yet to show a prohibition and the student who was carrying did not know of any prohibition. When specifically asked he did indicate that they may have changed the policy after the shooting, but if so he wasn't made aware of it. ",1,0,1444245916,1444721388

Just like borrowing a book from the library or parking your car. If you are going to say that borrowing books from the library is also banned, then I guess you and I just interpret the word 'banned' differently. If you are going to say needing to fill out paperwork is not a ban for a library book but is a ban for guns, then you are just being dishonest.
