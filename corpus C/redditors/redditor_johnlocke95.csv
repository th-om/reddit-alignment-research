cvxsau4,0,t1_cvxobsu,johnlocke95,"> it's reasonable to base a tech company there.

Its reasonable to base specific types of tech companies(if you need a lot of VC money or highly skilled talent). Otherwise, you are better off somewhere else.",-1,0,1444707891,1444730224
cvxnk8s,0,t1_cvx4o2v,johnlocke95,"> So the solution is just to have every indie dev post their game on Reddit and hope for upvotes? 

You don't just hope. There are detailed guides on how to make succesful Reddit posts.

To start with a simple technique, posting at the correct time of day on the correct day of the week. More dubious goals would be buying upvotes, which are very cheap, to get your post jump started.

The problem is rent for all your employees is super high, so you have to pay them a lot more.

You could base out of a city like Austin where everything costs a good bit less and still have decent access to talent.

The problem is companies all dream of being the next Facebook and if you want to expand that rapidly, then yeah you need to base out of San Francisco.",8,0,1444699266,1444730224
