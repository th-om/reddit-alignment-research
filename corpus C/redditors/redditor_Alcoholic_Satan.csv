cvx2y66,1,t3_3ogf55,Alcoholic_Satan,"I thought it was more of like Brazil's defeat in the World Cup. We were pretty much expected to do very well, if not win it all and then... Nothing. Now all the C9 fans are like the Brazilian fans who were crying on international television. Feels bad man.",2,0,1444669264,1444729938

cvvlkce,1,t3_3o9ohl,Alcoholic_Satan,"We had an extremely good chance from the get-go to at least get 2nd in our group, don't really know why people thought otherwise. Sure, we had to reverse sweep 2 teams to get to worlds, but TIP plays exactly like the Chinese do with being very aggressive. IG played like shit in their regular season and was very inconsistent during their playoff run.",0,0,1444545095,1444729938

cvnmnoo,0,t1_cvn1ucd,Alcoholic_Satan,"Pretty easy. Dad probably only sees daughter during visitation, so he'd rather spend the time with her happy then being a disciplinarian. If he was to discipline her all the time, with her being 8, she may start to get detached and not want to go to visitation anymore thus straining the relationship. There's also nothing they can do about it because they probably only see her during visitation. Any kind of habit changes wouldn't stick.

When I acted up at home, my mom would call my dad and when i went to visitation he'd ask me about it but he never yelled at me. Why would he want to? I barely saw him so why would he want all our time spent together to be negative. Besides, he wasn't my primary care taker anymore. Anything he did wouldn't matter when I went back home to my mom.",1,0,1443950979,1444729938
