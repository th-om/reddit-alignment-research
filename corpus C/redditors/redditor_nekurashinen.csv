And I haven't even scratched the surface!  Soooo many more...",3,0,1444704622,1444719457
cvxgmgp,0,t1_cvx1vzc,nekurashinen,"I agree with this.  I have used hallucinogens quite a bit in my past and believe they help open the mind in several ways.  This may lead you to become more spiritual... this is a great thing!  

Nearly every religion has a mystic side (Christianity is one that hides its mystical side but you can find it in Rosicrutianism). I aspire to Hermeticism, myself. I am also sober and haven't tripped in years but I cannot deny that I found my spirituality through hallucinogens.

Be safe, have fun. Remember that you don't NEED LSD to explore spirituality but it is often a doorway that many of us use. 

This can lead to you having a much more fulfilling life and becoming a pretty awesome person.  Just be responsible with it... as I've seen lives ruined in much the same way.",2,0,1444689257,1444719457
cvxg7d7,1,t3_3oi97c,nekurashinen,"Don't beat yourself up about it. It is important that you actually feel something about it. Hurray! you aren't a sociopath!   It is common for people to not know what they would do in a situation until it actually happens. Its also pretty common for people to not know what they would do even AS it happens.  This event helped answer a question within you that may help the next time this happens... and sadly, I am certain something like this will happen again. 

I think you are a ""hero"" simply just for feeling that you will never sit idle again.  We need a lot more of people like you! ",21,0,1444688585,1444719457

cvvxa01,0,t1_cvvwhpw,nekurashinen,Well clearly it is the fault of the drug for the absolute negligence demonstrated by your doctor. ,5,0,1444581813,1444719457
cvvx66y,0,t1_cvvvruo,nekurashinen,"Exactly. I came here to say the same thing. I've tried many different SSRIs and Prozac has been the one that consistently works best with me. Since my depression is largely associated with anxiety, perhaps that is why. These broad generalizations such as in the article really don't address the various individual ways people suffer and individual treatments. That is the job of your doctor to be able to pinpoint the most effective treatment. 

But saying... ""meh.. we tested tons of people and the placebo effect proves prozac sucks"" is ridiculous.",124,0,1444581626,1444719457
cvvwb5c,0,t1_cvvqkod,nekurashinen,"While I completely understand your frustration, I challenge you to consider maybe people are simply having fun or making light of dwarfism out of good intentions, not negative ones.  I, for example, absolutely love Warwick Davis' sense of humor when it comes to dwarfism. The guy is sometimes absolutely brutal in his self-effacing humor. What happens then is not ridicule but it lightens the ""elephant in the room"" awkwardness and reminds others that he is just as human and ridiculous as anyone and everyone. Then he stops being ""something different"" and becomes ""just one of us"". Does that make any sense?   Overall, I think people generally don't mean to be cruel and deep down want to stop looking at what makes someone different. Humor sort of becomes that universal thing that everyone can relate to. 

TL;DR: I think humor can bring us together instead of keep us apart ",1,0,1444580078,1444719457
cvvj5f9,1,t3_3o78h7,nekurashinen,The US is addicted to making them... they can't give them to police as easily anymore. We need to get them out somehow in order to keep the Military Industrial Machine churning. ,1,0,1444538529,1444719457
cvv4o4o,0,t1_cvv46rv,nekurashinen,"no... I cant remember her last name but my LinkedIn account constantly tries to pair us up again so I will check that.

EDIT:   Hudy, actually. So apparently there are multiple families with their own gimp. Yup, glad I left Michigan! ",3,0,1444510965,1444719457
