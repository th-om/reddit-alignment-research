cvv8sdp,0,t1_cvv8cne,GravitasFree,"> I would say that an objective morality, should it exist (and if morality does is exist, I contend it is objective), belongs to a species within itself - that is, the moral rules are constant as they pertain to members of the same specie, but not necessarily so between members of different species. We could probably open an entire thread just on this topic alone, so if this ends up being the origin of our disagreement than I say so be it (at least for today).

I think you're right in that this is the source of debate.  It's not unreasonable on its face, but I personally suspect that grouping by capacities will result in a more general framework than grouping by species.",2,0,1444518680,1444718040
cvv6b6t,0,t1_cvv5wiw,GravitasFree,"It still sounds like you are merely taking the intersection of {things with human DNA} and {things which I refer to when I say ""person""}

I think a few examples could help clear up the confusion we're having here:

When I say ""human"" I mean it as a synonym for homo sapiens, i.e. any organism the community of biologists considers to have a certain kind of DNA.

When I say person, I mean it as a synonym for a set of qualities which I believe to imbue moral ""worth"" in an organism.

For example: a human body without a brain is not a person.  A human body with a brain damaged or malformed such that conscious thought is impossible is not a person.

A human brain transferred into a completely artificial body is a person.  A dolphin that becomes sufficiently intelligent and possesses certain qualities of thought is a person.",3,0,1444514057,1444718040
cvv4hft,0,t1_cvv3zzn,GravitasFree,"> it seems to me that the use of personhood as the qualifying factor permits too much freedom in determining how the law might apply differently to whom

But you've just done it here:

>I would argue that simply having human DNA â‰  a member of the human species. Human in the sense of ""that which pertains to a human being,"" perhaps, but not human in the same manner as you nor I.

You seem to be using ""That which pertains to a human being"" as a long way of saying ""personhood"" without detailing it.  The word ""human"" in the definition gives a strong insinuation of a certain DNA, and I think it's a good idea to avoid the possible confusion its inclusion brings.",3,0,1444510631,1444718040
cvv3v5k,0,t1_cvv295l,GravitasFree,"When people use the word murder, both colloquially and legally, they mean a killing which is both intentional and not justified (however you define justified).

A killing, however, is any witting action which directly results in a death.

A doctor who makes a mistake during surgery may end up killing his patient, but that does not mean he committed murder.

cvv3fwc,0,t1_cvv2fd6,GravitasFree,"Personhood is a nebulous term because of the moral worth that so often comes attached to it.  I think it is an important part of the conversation because by my view, simply being human (having human DNA) does not give something any moral or conscious agency and those are the things that make ""rights"" applicable to a being.

It may seem arbitrary because most people use the word without a firm grasp on exactly what they mean by it, but the term still serves as a useful tool of distinction.",9,0,1444508717,1444718040
