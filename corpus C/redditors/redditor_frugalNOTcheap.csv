cvtu7p8,0,t1_cvt6vhf,frugalNOTcheap,I recently ate pizza 8 days in a row. I could have kept going but I worry about my health. We aren't talking a couple slices of pizza either. My wife and I always order at least a large and order of cheesesticks. I typically eat half the cheese sticks and 5-6 slices of pizza all washed down with cherry coke. The other night we even threw in those new peanut butter brownies from Dominoes with our regular order. And we ate all of it. I have a problem.,1,0,1444408168,1444721023
cvttto4,0,t1_cvttb5s,frugalNOTcheap,"I agree with what you said I'd just like to reinforce it. On top of what you mentioned today's PG is more more of a combo guard than a traditional pass first PG. Thinks guys like Russell Westbrook, Rose, Kyrie Irving, John Wall, etc. These guys attack the rim and put a toll on their body for it. Its not just the leaping at the rim but the constants changing direction in short periods of time trying to lose their man. Accelerating and decelerating is just hard on the joints. Tony seems to rely a lot of speed and acceleration but then again he is a Spur. If any organization could extend a guys career it'd be them. ",13,0,1444407581,1444721023

cvtp3es,0,t1_cvtepfs,frugalNOTcheap,Celtics Rondo was one of my favorite players but he has dropped in my rankings quite a bit over the years. I was really excited when he was traded to Dallas but we all know how that ended. I don't really care for the Kings so I don't know how to feel about this.,2,0,1444400236,1444721023
