cvx10jz,0,t1_cvwtnhb,SapCPark,"Are you shitting me?  Medical Research A) Isn't an industry, its a scientific field.  B) Should not be completely at the whims of a pharmaceutical or private company who wants every research project to have profitable results.  Scientific research has a lots of bends, turns, weird directions, and random tangents that somehow end up with an amazing discovery.  But these take a lot of time and patience and most of those steps will not have any profit value.  But they are still very valuable and should be done.  

Also if you want to know how private funded research can corrupt science, check out the story about lead in gasoline.  There was a lot of big money private interests funding scientists who said lead wasn't bad when in reality they were bribing them to make the data look better.  ",3,0,1444666268,1444716571

cvwzuu5,0,t1_cvwvpsb,SapCPark,Which is a little surprising because he mostly played a cover 3 with the rolling safety down into the flat against the Packers if they were in zone and used Cover 2 Man mostly.  Different defenses for different teams but his defense worked pretty well against the Packers so I though he would go back to that more,1,0,1444664402,1444716571
cvwy8pu,0,t1_cvwxurg,SapCPark,"To be fair to the Giants the defense was missing two starting LBs (Beason and Kennard), its best backup LB (Casillas) their best DE (Ayers), their 3rd best DE (Selvie), and at least one nickelback if not both for large stretches of the game (McBride and Hosely had limited action).  That defense had zero depth and it wore down as the game went on.  ",3,0,1444661665,1444716571
