cvrpaeq,1,t3_3nuw2z,Pandemic21,"No, they were not ruled by a 5 year old. The King or Queen would have a regent who would rule in his or her place until the King or Queen could ascend to the throne. 

Regent is defined as

>A person invested with royal authority by, or on behalf of, another; esp. a person appointed to administer the affairs of a country or state during the minority, absence, or incapacity of the monarch.

The regent for Louis XIV, for example, was [Anne of Austria](http://www.britannica.com/biography/Anne-of-Austria). Anne stepped down as regent in 1651.",1,0,1444250223,1444720580

I don't know how to ask without coming off as kind of a dick, but how can you say it's great to hear this assertion while your (great) response to the OP was you saying that assertions are bad? Isn't saying this assertion is good in direct conflict with your previous statement?",0,0,1444190365,1444720580

cvpc8wp,0,t1_cvhthl7,Pandemic21,"Bit late, but if you remember the part of the episode when she gets in the van and starts having flashbacks she remembers getting to the forest and eating. I imagine that every day has a skeleton script, but the days are fleshed out differently.

Evidence:

1. She remembered eating
2. The camo-wearing female pulled the taser (which, at the end of the episode, we were told they had on them in case of emergencies) on her when she went to pick up the phone the bystander dropped 
3. The fact that the park employees had tasers for emergencies on them in the first place
4. Natural phenomenon, such as rain or snow, would likely cause the scenario to play out differently

So she probably eats some days, like she remembered, and doesn't eat other days. There was also a lot of off-camera time she could eat (like, for example, during the van ride). ",1,0,1444078713,1444720580

cvkjaq3,0,t1_cvk7ms9,Pandemic21,"If I had to guess, it would be because ""moaning inwardly"" would indicate that you yourself are making a negative judgment about the situation. 

Interesting the second translation says literally the exact opposite in regards to ""moaning externally"" (or sympathizing). I would probably perfer that approach. The difference between ""moaning externally"" and ""moaning internally"" is that ""moaning externally"" is simply you showing sympathy for the how the other person feels (or, in other words, the judgment they made about the situation). ""Moaning internally"" means that not only are you showing sympathy, but you are agreeing with that negative judgment of the situation.",3,0,1443711611,1444720580
cvhrxxv,0,t1_cvhdxut,Pandemic21,"Unfortunately it's not literally a car, and everything is completely legal. Since this topic is getting older and falling off the front page, and explaining what's actually going on isn't likely to cause fights, what's actually happening is that I'm attending ITT Tech. The school is a complete diploma mill, but I've already sunk too much money into it to stop (I'm graduating next March). Completely legal, but also completely fucked up.

I might be able to use the advise in your first paragraph, though. Even though the education is shit and the professors don't care, I can glean something from it. The diploma isn't completely useless (just mostly useless), so that's something.

Thanks for the thoughts :)",1,0,1443501547,1444720580
cvh49r4,0,t1_cvh1plp,Pandemic21,"I  find this response both the least helpful and the most interesting. I find it the least helpful because I don't really understand what you are trying to say. Can you explain the second paragraph more? I don't quite understand what you're trying to get at...

I do find your first paragraph really interesting, and there is probably something there... I am making myself out to be the least powerful in my scenario, which is causing me to focus on the wrong things: things which I cannot control. I think you're right when you say that I need to reevaluate my situation and focus more on things I have control over, rather than things I do not. Understanding this and implementing it are two very different things, though. Do you have any suggestings regarding how I overcome the emotional hurdles, or passions, or what have you?",2,0,1443463396,1444720580
cvh41bu,0,t1_cvgz8we,Pandemic21,"I understand rationally what you're saying, it's just that it's emotionally difficult to just accept that this mistake I made is causing me to hemorrhage money. Acquiring a lot of money isn't a goal in life for me, but I'm at the point where it's hard for me to pay back loans and make rent. The constant reminders of this mistake make it difficult for me to get over my emotoins and just accept ht esituation, even though I understand that's what needs to be done.

Any suggestions regarding how I overcome the emotional hurdles involved?

Additoinally, what works from those authors would you recommend?",1,0,1443463049,1444720580
