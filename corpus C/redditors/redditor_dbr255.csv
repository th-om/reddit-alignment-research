cvvt7gu,1,t3_3ob04e,dbr255,"He didn't slide into the bag. He was solely trying to take out Tejada. He is nowhere near second base, he starts his slide super late, those are the 2 big problems I have. If you're going to take a guy out, slide into the base and do it. He didn't even give a shit either he got up and jogged back to the dugout without looking at the umpire ",1,0,1444573707,1444722769
cvvswea,1,t3_3obqfw,dbr255,"If you're going to drill someone it shouldn't be in the head. And chase is irrelevant at the plate anyway. If you're going to do it, hit someone who can hurt you with the bat. If utley happens to turn a double play at second though I hope he gets knocked into next week",2,0,1444572986,1444722769
cvvs4p2,1,t3_3oaw1k,dbr255,"Dirty, I'm fine with a takeout slide as long as you are sliding into the bag.  But the second you deviate from that and start sliding off the side like Utley did to specifically target an infielder in my mind that should be no different then running into a player trying to field a popup (like what happened to Ellsbury a few weeks ago) its interference and if you do it on a turn at second, should be an automatic DP.",10,0,1444570988,1444722769
