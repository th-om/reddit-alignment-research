cvvyheh,1,t3_3oav4p,Columbiano,"BYU and Northwestern are both bowl bound, for sure. But I believe both of those teams will end the season out of the top 25 and with four losses. So, yes, those teams were ranked at the time they played Michigan, but I'm not sure they'll be there at the end of the year. 

-Northwestern was riding high on its big win against Stanford, but I think this loss is the start of a downward trend against the meat of their schedule, with teams like Wisconsin, Iowa, Penn State, Nebraska up ahead. 

-And BYU...their best win is against Boise State, I guess? They have an incredibly weak schedule, with two losses to their best competition so far. Honestly, not sure how they were in that 22 spot to begin with. The only true tests they have left are Cincinnati and Missouri. ",1,0,1444583921,1444724254

cvrm3vi,0,t1_cvrhhp5,Columbiano,"Honest questions from a guy who doesn't watch much Big 12 ball. 

>For Baylor, it's a system that forces opponents to pick their poison. It all hinges on a quarterback who can make snap decisions and get the ball to the sidelines. We typically give our receivers ridiculously wide splits. This forces the defense to decide if they're going to designate their safeties to help out in coverage or if they're going to load the box and try to stop the run.

Why can't Big12 corners just go one-on-one with the receivers and provide a single safety over the top for help? Linebackers can prowl sideline to sideline if the play goes east-west instead of north-south.

> If they send their safeties wide or drop them back, our power run game and read option shred the inside of defense, and if they load the box, it's incredibly rare for defenses to lock down our receivers in press coverage for more than a few seconds and we burn them over the top. 

Sounds like the oline is pass protecting. How can you defeat teams with a power run game up the middle when pass protecting and not run-blocking? How big is the Baylor starting oline? How big is Baylor's running back? Is Baylor always in a 4 wide receiver set? Does the Big 12 not have any linebackers, I don't get it. Forgive me, as I don't watch much Baylor ball. Unless the Baylor oline has an entire group of nfl caliber players, there's likely something they're not good at. 

>That's why Briles likes to have an assembly line of quarterbacks- the system has to be instinctual to them, because as long as they're making the right reads and avoiding technical mistakes, our offense is impossible to stop. Except in the rare case of a team having corners capable of jamming and covering our receivers. If a team has top quality defensive backs and Baylor makes too many mistakes, the machine quickly falls apart. See also: WVU 2014, OSU 2013.

Seems like Baylor QBs have to be at the top of their game, for sure. But honestly, I'm still not so sure that Baylor isn't facing defenses that aren't very good. I'd like to see a school like Boston College, FSU or Ohio State go up against Balyor this year and see what happens. All I remember is from a couple years ago watching UCF have its way with Baylor.

I guess I'll have to go watch a Baylor game on Youtube.",7,0,1444245662,1444724254
