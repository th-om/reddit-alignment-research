cvwcbx9,1,t3_3odsrk,HelmedHorror,"The crucial distinction is that one is a physical good and the other is a digital good.

Selling two shirts requires twice the labour as selling one shirt.

Selling two copies of a video game requires negligibly more resources than selling one copy of a video game.

One single video game can make millions of dollars in revenue from thousands (or even millions) of $50 purchases, and that comes with a relatively negligible production cost per unit (i.e. the bandwidth to upload the files to the digital customer or the cost of producing a physical disc of the game.) One $50 shirt, on the other hand, only provides $50 of revenue.

And it doesn't make much sense to talk about whether something is ""worth"" $50 or ""justifies"" the price tag. They'll sell it for whatever people will buy it, because *worth* is by definition whatever people are willing to pay.",1,0,1444605838,1444719058

Sounds awfully similar to the sort of rhetoric you hear from fundamentalist Muslims today. And this was in 1786, way before US foreign policy could be used as a scapegoat for this worldview.",1,0,1444596979,1444719058

cvps92f,0,t1_cvpruzz,HelmedHorror,"> We do have this thing called a legal system. If you are accused of treason that does not mean you are guilty of treason.. that has to be proven. So suppose you are accused of treason, stripped of your citizenship then cleared of all charges in a trial. The problem is that you are no longer a citizen. Oops.

Right, which is why this bill specifies that your citizenship can be revoked if you have been **convicted** of treason, not merely *charged*.

'Oops' back to ya.",0,0,1444106293,1444719058
cvpm7ld,0,t1_cvplzhv,HelmedHorror,"No, it wasn't, and I just explained why. Let me try a different way of explaining this to you.

Given that most of Reddit is in North America it's understandable that he'd remark on which North American group gets an advantage. Since east-coasters wake up before west-coasters it makes sense that *any early-rising advantage* would go east-coasters rather than west-coasters. That still does not tell you what time zone the chart uses.

The best you can do is try to infer based on the height of the bars at different times which timezone it is most likely to be based on, given the remark that east-coasters have an early morning advantage. Even that is difficult since, as I mentioned, there's no fucking *units* for whatever it is the bars are measuring. Regardless, you can never be sure that such an inference would be correct. More to the point, you should not in the first place have to devote mental energy to inferring information that every fucking *third grader* knows *all* fucking charts must have.",2,0,1444095559,1444719058
cvplurd,0,t1_cvpl1ae,HelmedHorror,"It did **not** say in the title what timezone the chart uses. The title says that east coast early-risers have an advantage, but that doesn't mean that chart itself uses east coast time. To illustrate why, imagine if the chart used UTC time. The statement *""east coast early risers have an advantage""* would still be true. Thus, the presence of that statement cannot tell us whether the chart itself uses east coast time.

There is absolutely no excuse for not including the time zone in the chart and it's downright embarrassing. To make matters worse, there aren't even *units* for whatever it is the bars are measuring.",1,0,1444094975,1444719058
