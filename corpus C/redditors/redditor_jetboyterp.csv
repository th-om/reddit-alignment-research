cvtvro8,1,t3_3o4cnt,jetboyterp,"A few years ago I had the daunting task of cleaning out my grandparents' home after they passed away, and while cleaning out one of the upstairs bathrooms, I found a bottle of old cologne, circa 1970s, called ""Grass Oil"".  It looked like [**THIS**](http://i.imgur.com/H9T9Bmg.jpg).  I didn't even think twice about chucking it in the garbage.  

A few months later, out of curiosity I googled it, and surprisingly, I find a few vintage bottles of the stuff that are selling for a few hundred dollars each.  Or my old skateboard...a vintage Sims wide in good shape, I sold for $40 but was worth $400.  The stuff I actually thought was worth money ended up being worth only a few dollars.

Young elementary school kids learn English first, and not until those students have a clear understanding of that one, native language that they're prepared mentally to learn other languages.  You don't teach a little kid dozens of languages at the same time, and then years down the road allow them to choose one.

cvt3a9w,0,t1_cvstg2m,jetboyterp,"I suppose it would depend on each religious faith.  Speaking as a Catholic, The Roman Catholic Church has made it clear that a belief in, or existence of, extraterrestrial life...intelligent or otherwise...does not conflict with scripture or RC doctrine.  Nowhere in the bible does it even remotely suggest that God created life on only one world in this immensely vast universe.   ",2,0,1444346907,1444722861
cvt32zm,0,t1_cvstgzr,jetboyterp,"You have to understand...the bible isn't an astrophysics textbook, or an evolutionary science manual.  It's a collection of books written over the centuries.  When books like Genesis were written down, they were put in a way that most people of the time could most easily understand.  

A lot depends, as well, on scriptural interpretation.  Various Christian denominations interpret scripture differently than others.  Catholicism claims apostolic succession and that Christ Himself founded the One, True Church...infallible in interpreting the bible.  

The specifics of how long the universe, Earth, and human beings have been around, for examples, aren't important in the way that how we live our lives, how we treat each other, and how we hold our faith in He who created everything.  As the years go by, mankind continually makes strides in revealing more and more of God's blueprint for it all...and when we find ourselves in His presence after our Earthy death, all will be revealed.

And to put it mildly, it's gonna blow our minds in epic fashion.    ",3,0,1444346550,1444722861
