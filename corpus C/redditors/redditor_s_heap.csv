Sometimes the revolutionary forces do not have the resources to do this. The revolution should not be given up for the humanitarian treatment of the enemy, because the benefits the successful revolution will bring are worth some evil. However, I think part of your outrage is the belief that I am advocating for the execution of all prisoners. I do not believe this is the best path, because I personally do not believe the death penalty is just.
