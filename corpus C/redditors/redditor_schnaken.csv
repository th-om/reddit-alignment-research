I'm skeptical if the first one is actually true but at any rate with ACA being phased in, probably not that surprising although it does highlight the fact that we spend an exaggerated amount on healthcare in this country.

The female earnings one seems dubious to include as 2007 was immediately pre-recession.

If I wasn't lazy I would check if these numbers were even correct but as it stand they're still not particularly informative.",2,0,1442274034,1444729004
cv1h8hj,1,t3_3kxaf7,schnaken,"When Obama first came into office there were Republicans who were interested in healthcare reform and would have been receptive but tort reform would have needed to be on the table. At that time though the Democrats had the House and Senate and Obama was over confident. Then 2010 happened, the Tea Party came to power and the window closed.

You can condition your sample space in such a way that only protectionist countries experienced rapid growth and countries that failed to grow were not protectionist. But that certainly isn't all the available data. Anyway here a nice critique to bad samaritans which i'm assuming from this comment that you read.
