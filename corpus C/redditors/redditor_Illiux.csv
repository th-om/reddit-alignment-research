Caustics, we treat pretty casually. I can go down to the auto store and pick up 30% sulfuric acid (sold as battery acid) pretty easily, which can be further concentrated via distillation (which you can do at home if you are a crazy person who's okay with hot, vapor-phase sulfuric acid). Pure sodium hydroxide is really easy to get from any hardware store, and the other common hydroxides along with it (calcium, potassium). Calcium oxide can often be found at gardening stores. Hydrochloric acid is available in most hardware stores as well. Pool stores often sell sodium bisulfate as a PH lowerer, and both hydrochloric and sulfuric acid can be synthesized from it. All of these chemicals are very caustic. Sulfuric acid in particular messes up flesh really bad because of its oxidizing and hydrophilic effects. And you really don't want lye or quicklime on your flesh either.

You're right on explosives though. Most nitrites and nitrates are hard to get in various places. And nitric acid is not generally available.

EDIT: Noticed I used some names interchangeably. Hydrochloric acid = muriatic acid, calcium oxide = quicklime, sodium hydroxide = lye",23,0,1444690075,1444726132

So you'll have it transfer into a gas, then quickly condense into a mist and freeze into a cloud of tiny crystals.",1,0,1444429161,1444726132
cvtybu7,0,t1_cvtt5m6,Illiux,"The boiling point of a liquid occurs where vapor pressure exceeds external pressure. In space that later term is zero, so it doesn't freeze, it boils. Additionally, heat can't be transfered to a vaccum, and so the vaccum of space keeps things warm. Something in space can only lose heat by conduction to the few molecules that do exist, since space isn't a total vaccum, and by radiation.",1,0,1444414295,1444726132

I um, don't want to propose a meal-based analogy here.",1,0,1444175290,1444726132
cvm4fl0,0,t1_cvlizou,Illiux,"It's worth noting that modern scholarship considers Jung quite severely wrong about almost everything with regards to alchemy. *Alchemy: Tried in the Fire* is a good read here. But in any case, Jung was almost entirely unaware of corpuscularianism, the dominant alchemical theory from around 1600 or so and quite obviously unaware that a great deal of alchemists rejected Aristotlean physics and the four elements along with it. He was part of the larger tradition derived from Victorian occultism that tried to recast alchemy as a spiritual discipline. This often involves drawing a distinction between alchemy, metallurgy, and medicine where not much of one historically existed and downplaying the highly quantitative practice of assaying. Today, we have access to things Jung did not, like George Starkey's (a fairly successful and widely read alchemist in the 17th century) laboratory notes, which quite plainly show a highly quantitative and experimental alchemy focused on material results.

tl;dr Jung was almost entirely wrong about everything in his writings on alchemy.",1,0,1443819905,1444726132
