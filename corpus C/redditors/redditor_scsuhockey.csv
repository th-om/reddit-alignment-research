cvxeklg,1,t3_3oi570,scsuhockey,"Because political views are often fueled by a positive feedback loop, my guess is that most true ""independents"" are generally apolitical. They can be swayed by fear or hope, the stronger motivator being fear. It's difficult to imagine them being swayed by detailed analysis, as I feel folks who do that will generally align themselves with the views of one political party or the other. After all, there isn't a lot of overlap these days.

I'd be curious to know if any of the conservatives in this thread have put money on a Republican candidate, or at least what type of odds they'd need to do so. Jeb is currently 6-1. What if he was 20-1? 100-1?",1,0,1444425432,1444717894
