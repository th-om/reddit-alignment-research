cvxwf78,0,t1_cvxvzuk,geekygirl23,I'm not going to argue about this but there are a dozen reasons one should prefer a .22 at any kind of distance. You go start firing off shots at someone or someones with a 12 gauge and a handful of slugs and let us know how that goes for you.,0,0,1444718014,1444725455

cvxvxl2,0,t1_cvxttew,geekygirl23,"While on a deer stand at 5am in the pitch  black I saw a guy walk by, stop to take a shit then keep going. Also saw a very vicious looking beast of some sort, just staring at me, rocking back and forth at times. Daylight comes, beast is a bush and I assure you no guy stopped to take a shit in front of the deer stand.

I've often wondered how my life would be if I believed everything my imagination ever put in my head. When I read your post I finally figured it out.",10,0,1444716431,1444725455

Dead, stillborn sack of filth hanging out of it. I thought of it 2 minutes ago then saw you comment. I wonder if the same thing reminded you of it?",5,0,1444714788,1444725455
