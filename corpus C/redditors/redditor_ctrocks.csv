I remember around 2008/2009 making commentary (think it was on Digg though) about how at the first midterm the Democrats would badly lose because they would overreach and not do what the populace really wanted. We can see how that turned out.",1,0,1444669499,1444717043

cvwtvz4,0,t1_cvwtfxm,ctrocks,"As someone pointed out in another comment, evidently the team name of an Indian Reservation School is the Redskins. They are not offended by it. Therefore it is not blatantly racist. 

Far too often there is outrage by liberals for some group that they are not a member of. However, far too often it is nothing but white guilt over something that does not really matter to the group you are trying to protect. 

Or, if someone who is a member of a normally ""protected"" class, such as African Americans (though not all have African descent) but disagrees with the group think (any Conservative who is black), tends to be called things like a race traitor, uncle tom, etc. 

Conservatives tend to want to treat everyone the same, and not treat people differently because of their race. Who is being racist, the person who thinks everyone is equal, or the one who calls people that do not agree with them Uncle Tom's or worse?? Judge people by their actions, not the color of their skin. And, in the case of Redskins, let the tribes complain about it (and not just a couple of real loud ones) rather than a person who is trying to see how politically correct they can be doing something because it sounds/feels good.

We tend to fight liberals because far to often these feel good propositions end up costing everyone money without any real positive effect, and often has negative effects.",6,0,1444651653,1444717043

If you assume a 20% auto abortion rate, it looks like about 15% of pregnancies end in abortion, which much higher than the failure rate of most contraceptives. Therefore, they must be from unprotected sex, which is not being responsible if you do not want children. Now I have data. I was not making stuff up.

I don't know why you are so up in arms about someone who has a different opinion, and most of all why you want to silence someone who has a different opinion. And now I have facts on my side, not just my opinion based on anecdotal evidence. So my opinion that I like blue better than green is worthless without facts?? I get you are pro abortion, and my guess is you are for unlimited abortions up until the baby is born. Or, do you have limits on acceptable abortion? Why cannot you respect someone else's opinion? I am not saying it should be illegal, just that it is normally preventable with birth control and/or abstinence, and that I think it is normally immoral.",2,0,1444579315,1444717043
cvvv1yy,0,t1_cvvthz4,ctrocks,"Ya know what, I had a whole diatribe I wrote out in response. I will keep it a bit more simple. 

First, I am offering my opinion on /r/politicaldiscussion. Telling me I should sit out is telling me that I have nothing good to say. I think my opinion should be judged here just like everyone elses. I am sorry I don't toe the line of abortion being nothing than removing a clump of parasitic cells that all of a sudden becomes a human baby at birth. If a fertilized egg, blastula, embryo, fetus, is more than a clump of cells, maybe abortion is immoral, even if it is the right thing to do for that person and society. War is immoral, but it can be the right thing to do (WWII is a good example).

Second, I said I am pro abortion (up to the point of medical viability, because if you wanted it to be to the point of being self sustaining, I could easily say that 6 month old baby who was killed was just a post birth abortion), just that I think it is the worst method of birth control and that people should be more responsible. 

Third, and last, I thoroughly acknowledge that birth control failures happen, and that all abortions are not because of negligence (though if you read your own report, the rate of pregnancy for ""proper"" use is 2 in 100). I think abortion makes for less unwanted children and is better for society.",2,0,1444577671,1444717043

I like Born to Run, Cadillac Ranch, Hungry Heart, Cover Me, I'm on Fire and some others where he does more traditional singing.",1,0,1444573833,1444717043
