csmm3le,1,t3_3b52fo,louisberg13,Was in Zambia in 2011 and although it wouldn't be regarded as the most dangerous of african countries the bus we were in was stopped at a police checkpoint where an officer entered the bus armed with a gun (he didn't pull it out) and demanded money. At the end of the day Africa is underdeveloped and things just aren't the same/as safe as western culture.  ,1,0,1435601054,1444726374
csmk7dz,1,t3_3bg8c9,louisberg13,"Route 2 100%. As a native irishman and having visited both areas I feel obliged to persuade you to the west. 

Note on route 1. 
Belfast itself is in its own right a great city but can at times feel bleak and cold with my only highlight being the Titanic visit. The giants causeway however was a huge disappointment for me. I had expected big things only to left completely underwhelmed. 

Route 2
Having spent many a summer in Connemara in particular the Westport area I can only say you won't be left down. The Cliffs of Moher, Galway city and the Aran Islands are extraordinary places. I must however suggest traveling from Galway through to Westport at some stage. Some of Irelands best scenery can be seen through the Galway-Clifden-Renvyle-Leenaun-Westport route. The holy peak of Croagh Patrick and the amazing town of Westport are absolute jewels of western Ireland. 

Whatever your decision i'm sure you will enjoy your visit. ",3,0,1435598153,1444726374
