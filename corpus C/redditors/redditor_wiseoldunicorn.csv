cvpyatm,0,t1_cvpuqx9,wiseoldunicorn,"I have experienced the ""turnaround"" from years of loneliness to being loved, and it was amazing for a while. But when the honeymoon period was over, I found that I still had all the same depression, low self-esteem, and other issues I'd always had. Not only did I have those issues in spite of being in a wonderful relationship, I also realized that those exact issues were now fucking up said wonderful relationship.

It sounds cliche to say that you can't be happy with someone until you know how to be happy on your own, but it's a cliche for a reason. Ideally, you want to enter into a relationship with someone because you're whole on your own, you love them for who they are, and you want to be with them. But if you can't be happy on your own, then any relationship you get into will be based on your own co-dependent need for the other to make you happy. And relying on your partner to make you happy is a good way to either suffocate a good relationship, or end up in a terrible, abusive one. I've both done it myself and seen many good friends go down the same route. It never works out.

Also, for the record, being alone is better than being in a bad relationship any day. Anyone that presumes otherwise has never experienced the turnaround from abuse to freedom.",24,0,1444128716,1444716594
cvpupd0,0,t1_cvprndg,wiseoldunicorn,"Not having sex doesn't fuck up your brain, bro. Lack of love and acceptance from others can (particularly if it happens from an early age), but nothing is irreversible.

cvpumai,0,t1_cvptzfk,wiseoldunicorn,"Romantic, but unrealistic. People with such toxic attitudes rarely make good romantic partners. If they don't treat their partner badly, then their self-esteem is usually so low they're unable to be a good partner due to co-dependence, jealousy, or other issues. And having a positive influence on others is all well and good, but falling for/dating/fucking someone expecting them to change is a guaranteed recipe for disaster.",50,0,1444113147,1444716594
cvpsncf,0,t1_cvpmqnf,wiseoldunicorn,"I've had three different S1s and an S3, and my husband had an S4 and S5. Samsung can do great hardware, but their software is just terrible. I was astonished when I got my M8 at how smoothly and error-free everything runs, and my husband is going through the same thing now with his LG G4. TouchWiz is just crap, IMO.

cv8rfvp,0,t1_cv6hrgn,wiseoldunicorn,"Based on the plans I've seen from Bernie's campaign, it seems like most, if not all of the burden would fall on the wealthiest taxpayers, not the average American. We're talking about, for example, anyone who makes over $400,000 a year having to pay higher taxes ONLY on the money they make over that amount. We're not talking the average working family paying a 45% tax rate. That's one of the few advantages of having such high levels of wealth inequality--we can raise very small taxes on very small numbers of people and reap huge rewards in tax money.

I disagree that it's harder to argue a general common good. Perhaps for education (although I still think you can make an argument there too), but healthcare? Being able to see a doctor when you need one is just as important as being able to put your house out when it's on fire. I'm well-off, and I still struggle with medical bills. People in America die on a regular basis because of conditions that would have been simple to treat, had they only had the funds to see a doctor. You know where that doesn't happen? Countries where they have single-payer healthcare. Not only that, they spend FAR less on healthcare than we do; it actually tends to drive down the cost of care. Every single person I know that lives in a single-payer country loves their healthcare system and doesn't understand why we've been so slow to catch on.",2,0,1442814102,1444716594

cv5rlov,0,t1_cv5fcbb,wiseoldunicorn,"You, as a working family, are very unlikely to be part of the demographic that would be affected by the tax increases Bernie wants. Do you make over $400,000 a year? Because if not, you won't be affected by any of the plans he's released so far--if anything, you and your children are very likely to benefit. And if you do make more than $400k, then I'm sorry, but you are not struggling and you can afford it. Don't expect me to feel sorry for you if you're rolling in that kind of dough.

I'm a trust fund kid. I very well might be part of the demographic that will have their taxes raised, particularly on the inheritance tax. And I'm okay with that, because God dammit, I can fucking afford to pay more in taxes to help those with less get things like free healthcare and free education. I'd also much rather my tax money go to helping people than to pursuing another pointless war, or offering more welfare to corporations.",11,0,1442578736,1444716594
