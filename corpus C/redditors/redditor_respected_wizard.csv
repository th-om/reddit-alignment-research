cuw8j42,0,t1_cuw7z2f,respected_wizard,"I didn't say it was a right. I said it was taken as one so there's not as much political will to say women have to pay more for something that may keep them alive. And I was commenting on why its not illegal to price discriminate in regards to driving, not why insurance companies do this.",2,0,1441845065,1444731052
cuw7utr,1,t3_3kbd4z,respected_wizard,"Well it could be that driving is seen as more of a privilege, while health care is more or less given as a right. Also, reckless driving, which men are more likely to do is harmful to society, while  good health is beneficial. Just a thought.",14,0,1441843863,1444731052

crqusjs,0,t1_crpiawd,respected_wizard,"I'm kinda responding a little late I suppose but I can see the value of a land tax in a regional/metropolitan context. It would encourage infill development to occur in cities and built up areas where land is generally more expensive. A land tax would theoretically make it more possible to develop in an area where there are more people as well which could be good for certain commercial uses that don't require a lot space, like offices or retail. I don't think it would be a good national policy, however. ",1,0,1433084596,1444731052
