>Common sense and ""meet in the middle"" approaches only work if you're willing to budge

Like I said, the fact that you think the term ""assault weapons"" was invented by gun control types proves I've read more about the subject than you have.",-8,0,1443371212,1444726912

Think about what guns looked like when the Second Amendment was ratified: ball-and-powder muskets. Hey, you can have all of those you want; I can knock you out with my bare fists before you could even get a shot off. Assault weapons? No one who isn't in a war zone has any possible need for those.",-13,0,1443370960,1444726912

By the way, the ""assault weapon"" argument is really tired. If you guys don't like that name for those weapons, you probably shouldn't have called them that - y'know, before you rebranded them after people started going on rampages with them.
