From my perspective what he has done is wrong; there are plenty of people who work hard and do more for society than him who have none of his security, and his pursuit of capital accumulation puts that security even further out of their reach.",8,0,1444598517,1444721829
cvw7grf,0,t1_cvw76qa,Aceofshovels,"This is an example of over-accumulation, which is one of the inherent flaws in capitalism. One person owning 37 properties when so many people can't afford one is already a cruel joke. How would you resolve the problem?",20,0,1444597636,1444721829
cvw74c7,0,t1_cvw6vzh,Aceofshovels,"There's no reason for one person to own 37 houses when so many people can't afford one. Like it or not, the pressure that landlords like this guy put on the market is one of the barriers that new home owners face. And then they use the rent they extract from 37 families to raise the barrier even higher. He isn't the entire problem but he's a symptom of a large part of it, rampant inequality.

I do still have an issue with one person owning an entire apartment block, but one person owning 37 separate properties is far worse.",13,0,1444597074,1444721829
