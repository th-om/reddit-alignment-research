edit: I'm not asking a rhetorical question. I would actually like to know which statues you believe he has violated as President. I'm willing to listen.",28,0,1444661812,1444726472
cvuea6y,0,t1_cvtxw0k,EzzeJenkins,"Democrats are angling to put Texas in the purple if not blue territory in 2020 or 2024. With one of the Castro brothers running that could be imminently possible. 

The latino demographic in Texas is *huge* but so far they haven't been mobilized to vote for a candidate and it's a much more difficult demographic than black voters to get to a consensus. Having a young vibrant latino running for President of the United States might just be the thing that pushes Texas from Red all the way to Blue.

Remember Texas isn't as red as people like to think it wasn't that long ago that Ann Richards, a female Democrat, was governor. 

I think you'd be foolish to completely count out Texas as a democratic state a lot sooner than some would imagine. ",2,0,1444441427,1444726472

It wasn't an accident to hit those bugs, you knew the consequences of getting into a car and driving down the freeway. Mass reckless endangerment of flying insects should and would probably be considered abuse for the purposes of this wish. ",0,0,1444407796,1444726472

cvqiz67,1,t3_3nr43m,EzzeJenkins,"Basic Income needs to be a top priority in the coming years because the country(and the world) is about to face an unemployment crisis never seen or imagined before.

The robots are coming. Millions of transportation, factory, and low skill jobs are close to being completely automated. Even high skill jobs like doctors aren't safe as we are getting ever closer to creating robots that can treat and even diagnose illness.

Practically the only thing to do is to give everyone a basic income. Those with unique skills will still have jobs and be compensated well but a vast majority of the population is about to be out of work. People who have dedicated their lives to careers that will be obsolete or replaced by automation. It's not their fault and I think it's the countries responsibility to take care of its citizens.

Whether it can be bipartisan or not it needs to be and politicians need to start working on it NOW.",-6,0,1444164716,1444726472
