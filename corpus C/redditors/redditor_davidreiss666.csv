I want to believe that Sanders has a shot.   But I can't help but think that he is going to be considered too left for the country.   I'm afraid that Obama is about as far left as one can go and be electable in the United States.  And sadly, Obama isn't much of a leftist at all.   He's mostly to the right of Reagan.

cvujebn,0,t1_cvuhct8,davidreiss666,"What is wrong with Monsanto?  

Is it that they are large multinational corporation?   A big old $14-billion company.    Cause if it's that, then why aren't you focusing on the really big companies, like Apple, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, Exxon Mobil, Chevron,  Total S.A., BP, GE, Siemens, Comcast, Time Warner, AT&T, Verizon, WalMart, Toyota, GM, Ford, Honda, etc.  All of which are between 10 and 100 times the size of Monsanto?  

That Monsanto sues farmers for seed that blew on to their fields?    Ignoring the fact that it just never happened.

>They do not sue farmers for seeds blowing into their fields. They have only pursued cases against farmers who deliberately tried to violate their contracts and essentially steal seed.

>Myth 2: Monsanto will sue you for growing their patented GMOs if traces of those GMOs entered your fields through wind-blown pollen.

>This is the idea that I see most often. A group of organic farmers, in fact, recently sued Monsanto, asserting that GMOs might contaminate their crops and then Monsanto might accuse them of patent infringement. The farmers couldn't cite a single instance in which this had happened, though, and the judge dismissed the case. 

There is so much BS-cruft out there about GMOs in general.   Please read the following....  as they expose the myths around GMO's and Monsanto in general.
