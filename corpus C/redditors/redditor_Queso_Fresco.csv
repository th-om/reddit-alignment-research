cvrgk8v,1,t3_3nutqd,Queso_Fresco,"Two reasons: Very Low Interest Rates + Deregulation of Financial Markets

&nbsp;

**Low Interest Rates:**

Low interest rates on loans from the government were championed under Federal Reserve Chairmans Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke. This allowed markets to greatly over-invest and gave businesses incentive to invest no matter what the future cost may be.

&nbsp;

**Deregulation:**

Deregulation also occurred during this time, which involved decreasing restrictions and governmental checks on financial markets, not enforcing current regulations, and the lack of any regulation at all in new financial markets (especially derivatives). This allowed the markets to create such large bubbles that they caused market-wide failure.",6,0,1444237663,1444722987

cv9dnup,0,t1_cv9blby,Queso_Fresco,"I don't understand your point about deadweight loss, because it sounds like you're applying the same amount of taxes, so there would be the same loss.

And this vat tax will lower the incentive to consume, while increasing funds to invest, even if it just effects the richer populations. In my opinion, there is already too much incentive for investment markets. ",1,0,1442865878,1444722987
cv9as2l,0,t1_cv99qij,Queso_Fresco,"Some of these policies make sense, and others are more controversial, but may still be beneficial. But the one that has never made any sense to me is switching from income tax to consumption tax. All that would do is switch the tax burden from supply onto demand, so demand would greatly decrease instead of supply. On top of that, it would always negatively affect poorer populations more because they spend near 100% of their income on consumption while the richer populations spend much greater amounts of their income on investments that don't benefit the economy nearly as much.",9,0,1442861562,1444722987
cv321fe,0,t1_cv1wqvw,Queso_Fresco,"Your post should be at the top. It's very unbiased and provides the most accurate generalizations. 

I would only change a few things:

- the labor point kind of falls under economic equity

- add a point about how social liberals focus on reducing their society's externalities on others (environmentalism, non-interventionist, Healthcare, etc) 

- add a point about how protectionist conservatives focus on protecting their society from others (interventionist policy, immigration, terrorism, etc) 

Not sure how to make my points sound less biased, though. ",1,0,1442368063,1444722987
