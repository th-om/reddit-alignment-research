cve92n2,0,t1_cve8hob,SaltedCream,"What do you mean Morde doesn't need to be 6? The Dragon Force passive is tied to Children of the Grave. You have to have 1 point in his ultimate to get the passive, so yes he needs to be 6.

Both my experience with sandbox modes in other games and my own knowledge as a programmer is what I'm basing my time-estimates on. For the user, it's not very hard to type ""spawn: Enslaved Dragon [enemy team]"" or if it still requires a second person ""set player6 level 6"" or whatever language their sandbox would use.",4,0,1443220052,1444728831
cve6tko,0,t1_cve5xu2,SaltedCream,"Getting a friend (because you can't test this alone) and getting into a game, getting Morde to 6, and then killing dragon to test: 7-10 minutes if you can find someone willing to test with you quickly.

Getting into sandbox and testing: 2-3 minutes tops. Even less if you're already in a sandbox.

OR just play Nocturne enough that you run into an enemy Morde with a dragon and test at that point, I guess.",6,0,1443216020,1444728831

>I just canâ€™t imagine that happening in America even if Sanders gets in.

You're correct. When/if Sanders is elected, we need to continue the movement and push further, replacing representatives until Congress is at such a state that this kind of change could happen. It's doable, but will be difficult because of all the gerrymandering. The momentum needs to continue this time, unlike how it stopped after Obama was elected.",3,0,1442858459,1444728831

It is, and I don't think you'd find many people attacking Walmart disagree with that. Walmart is attacked most directly just because they happen to be one of the largest employers in the country. ""Walmart"" is just representative of the greater system in these arguments.",0,0,1441605565,1444728831
