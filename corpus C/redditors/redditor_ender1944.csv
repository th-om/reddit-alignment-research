cvwvtor,0,t1_cvwsfgd,ender1944,"I take 3 or 4 things I am trying to learn. Lets say 1 is waveshining more consistently, 2 is ledge mechanics, 3 is oos options, 4 is shield dropping. I'll set the timer for 10 minutes, then for 10 minutes practice each tech in order like I'm working out - 3 sets of each one, tech 1 tech 2 tech 3 tech 4 tech 1 tech 2 tech 3 etc.  This is really good practice and warm up.

Next, I try to incorporate more mental practice to prevent things from getting stale.  So I'll put a shielding opponent on in 20xx and practice options and mindgames, trying hard as I can to not autopilot.  Example would be like, practicing aerials with different drift, with different followups, or dash dancing techniques.  To prevent autopiloting, I randomize the order and speed of the options I use, like (A) dash dance running shine (A) dash dance running shine (B) nair shine to (C) aerial drift away to (D) jab to (E) running shine grab, do that 20 times, then pick a different assortment/ order of options (CEDEBZA, ABABBCE, random etc.)

Finally I like to make a list of matchups I'm struggling with, then analyze high level matches with those matches.  I try to understand every option, and be aware of which techniques and strategies are outside of my purview.
