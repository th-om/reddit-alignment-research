cvvzl37,0,t1_cvvl6g3,dakta,"I agree about the response. It's just that proponents of equality do themselves and their movement absolutely no favors whatsoever by making issues out of things like this.

If they focused on the most pressing and substantive issues, such as the treatment of women and girls throughout the Middle East and Africa, they would make more meaningful progress without needlessly pissing off people who would otherwise be mere bystanders or even casual supporters.

It's just bad strategy, and as a proponent of equality it really pisses me off. I won't call names, but I will point out how ridiculously unproductive it is.",1,0,1444585669,1444728838

cvvlq51,0,t1_cvvl56l,dakta,"Sometimes street cars are used to kill people on purpose. Ever heard of road rage?

Look, we get that it's not their designed purpose, whereas firearms are designed to launch a projectile to cause injury/death. But the point remains that banning so-called ""assault weapons"", even if completely successful, would be statistically insignificant in reducing gun violence since those firearms are used so relatively infrequently.",14,0,1444545652,1444728838

cvvkxlk,0,t1_cvvkamm,dakta,"This would be a totally reasonable rebuttal for you to make if the issue were over a project like http://bropages.org/ (casually worded and easy to use adaptations of man pages for software), but this is literally about a truncated file extension that has nothing to do with gender.

It was .bro because the project was Brotli. It's pretty standard to abbreviate or truncate your project name for its file format extension.  Even the project name itself still doesn't have anything to do with gender. It just sounds the same.",6,0,1444543077,1444728838
