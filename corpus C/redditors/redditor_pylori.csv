I think it's the argument that is misunderstood. It's not that it's perfectly safe, although for most people it tends to be fairly safe, it's also a personal liberties issue. We can choose to do plenty of things in our lives that are either unsafe or can harm us in the short and long term. Consumption of burnt/heavily cooked meats and food products contributes to colorectal cancer, yet no-one is advocating that we ban that because it has serious adverse effects on human health.

In a fair society you shouldn't need a reason to make something legal, you should need a reason to make it illegal. And aside from the questions of safety, clearly we do not benefit by keeping it illegal as it is still easy to access and instead furthers and contributes to other illicit activities. I understand some may think it shouldn't be consumed, but the current status quo doesn't in any measurable way impact its use either.

Decriminalisation would move a big step into not just ridding the police and courts system of unnecessary burden, but it would provide income for the government, help to reduce other illegal activities by channeling funding away, and allow the safe and controlled use of the drug.",2,0,1444686031,1444721079
cvxdpny,0,t1_cvxd3ep,pylori,"> Don't doctors basically make decisions in an algorithmic fashion

Not really. I mean sure ordering lab tests and imaging can be automated in terms of what you'd likely order based on a set of symptoms and/or patient history, but interpreting that is a different thing entirely.

The results of tests are rarely a simple yes or no, and they can be misleading too, not the same results in every case of a disease, with varying symptoms, test results and clinical courses. How would a computer go about deciding what to do then?

There's a lot of thinking involved in trying to deduce that diagnosis that is far more than a big algorithm. Doctors also heavily rely on their clinical experience to make decisions, an computer algorithm just goes through the same thing, how could it account for that?",4,0,1444684730,1444721079
