cvx4w8k,0,t1_cvx2j9h,sjets3,"$30 mil is nearly impossible to swallow. Right now, our total liabilities for 2016 is almost $20 mil under the cap. That means we wouldn't be able to resign anybody, nor any draft picks, and we'd still have to cut almost $10 mil. http://overthecap.com/calculator/new-york-jets/

Also, Brees will be 37 next year. He isn't lasting forever, especially in the cold AFC east winter games.

Lastly, what are you prepared to give up in a trade to get Brees? The Saints aren't gonna just cut him.",2,0,1444672123,1444731232

cvx1blo,1,t3_3ognze,sjets3,"To give you an actual answer. Hell no. His cap hit is $30 mil next year, and we cannot afford that. Plus, he is clearly in the decline and that shoulder is getting weaker with age. At this point, he's not that much better than another year of Fitz or Geno or Petty or whoever that he's worth all of that money.

Plus, the Saints aren't gonna just give him away, and if they do, that's all the more reason to stay away.",5,0,1444666761,1444731232
cvwuybu,0,t1_cvwlor6,sjets3,Exactly what I was thinking. Rex used to give the team a week off and we would come back after the bye week looking slow and unprepared. I don't expect that from Bowles.,5,0,1444654768,1444731232

cvto076,0,t1_cvthybz,sjets3,"I don't disagree with you, and I believe we should try to build a similar kind of relationship with Iran. But I do also think we need to push them on civil rights issues.

cvtnyeo,0,t1_cvsz7is,sjets3,"I think pensions and tenure need to be reformed. For many pensions (as far as I know), what the pension is is dependent on the average money earned for the last several years before retirement. This leads to people taking on extra responsibilities or working tons of overtime shortly before retirement to increase their pensions. I would just change it so the pension is the person's base salary for the preceding years so it isn't as easy to artificially inflate them.",1,0,1444398157,1444731232
