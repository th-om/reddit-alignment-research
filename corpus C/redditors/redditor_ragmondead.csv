cvsxv38,0,t1_cvsx9v6,ragmondead,"Well it's raw data. 

If a champ has a 40% win rate it is very likely they are in a weak state. Conclusions like that are very simple. The problem comes from players thinking that 50% is some magical point that they need to get past. Using data to figure out what is best is a good thing.... but it's not nearly as simple as people think it is.  ",1,0,1444338111,1444721298
cvsv9ol,1,t3_3nz0pn,ragmondead,"Win rate is raw data. There are conclusions you can reach from it, but it is not as simple as people think. 

1st, statistical significance can be calculated. A good site would have a +/- on it. So bard will win 53 +/- 4% of games. This takes into account how many games have been played. Anything over 5% is considered statistically insignificant. 

So when Zilean mid had a win rate of 55% with 250 games played, thats a 55% +/-10%. So what it is saying is that YOUR expected win rate is somewhere between 45% and 65%.

2nd. Win rate does not take into account matchups. Alister usually has a sub 50% win rate. But that is across all games. When you play Alister with an ADC that wants a big tank in lane the numbers go way up. And when you then put him aginst a poke support like Annie or Vel the win rate goes even higher. 

So it is entirely possible to play the 48% win rate Alister with an expected win rate of 53%. ",1,0,1444334386,1444721298

cvpj8xv,1,t3_3nljod,ragmondead,"So bard is like Thresh, he requires a competent team to truly be at his best. 

You need to have an ADC that can survive in lane while you get meeps

you need to have a jungler that knows how to use your magical journeys to gank (preferably while you are gathering meeps and your ADC is pushed to turret) 

You need to have a team that knows how to engage with your ult

AND you need to have a team that know how, when and why to pick up a shrine. 

Bard is balanced around your team doing all that, so bard is lacking tools other supports have. If your team is not playing with you, you are activity weaker because you picked bard. 

As for a solid thing to do to improve your bard play, I would work on ganking with your jungler. bard is not an ADC's support, he is a junglers support. Invade, gank (even mid) and just be aware of your jungle. 

SOMETHING SPECIFIC. gather meeps, tell your adc to get pushed, tell your jungler to meet in tri. SWEEP TRI FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. magical journey in.

cvmyriq,1,t3_3nbtp7,ragmondead,"So top lane she is very strong against juggernauts (garen, Darius). the polymorph paired with her good poke makes her a great counter pick as it is very unlikely that she will die during the laning phase and those juggernauts need kills to get going. 

mid lane it is similar, she is a very safe mid laner which makes her a great pick to all ins, especially AD mid laners. 

Those two strong lanes paired with her abilty to play as support means that she has become a 'flex pick' or a pick that you can take for any number of players. 

So you can 1st pick a lulu and your opponent cannot pick a garen until you reveal if that is a top or mid lulu. (she sees very little competitive support play.) ",1,0,1443897183,1444721298
