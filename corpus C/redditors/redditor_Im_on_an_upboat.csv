cvwmp2h,0,t1_cvweukg,Im_on_an_upboat,"I feel this common so hard. More proof of Bevells terribleness is that after all our success, not 1 team has even hinted at wanting him as a coach. Seriously 2 Sb appearances and not even a whisper of interest. Wilson has made him look way better than he is because he can scramble and just make shit happen. All our best plays seem to be made up. Not a good sign for a ""coordinator"". ",2,0,1444625440,1444726480

cvlwgeo,1,t3_3n7lqt,Im_on_an_upboat,"I will add one more comment regarding MSPI, it starts around 4 weeks because that is when there has been enough of the proteins to build up and cause a problem. If you test it out by giving Elecare formula, you will see immediate relief in 24-48 hours as the proteins get filtered out. Then it will continue to get better. 

It takes 2-3 weeks for the proteins to be filtered out of YOUR system, once you stop ingesting milk and soy. It will then take an additional 2-3 weeks for it to get out of baby's system once they aren't getting it anymore. ",1,0,1443807603,1444726480
cvlvqji,0,t1_cvlu9ag,Im_on_an_upboat,"In case you end up having another baby, just wanted to let you know that Alimentum isn't 100% hypoallergenic. The proteins are broken-down, but still exist, so some babies with the allergy to milk and soy (about 25%) still react to Alimentum. How do I know? My daugher was that 25% hahaha. I can only laugh now because she has been healthy for 4 months. Luckily we have an amazing gastroenterologist for our LO that has helped us a ton in getting her healthy.  

There are only a few formulas that are entirely hypoallergenic (no milk/soy proteins at all): Elecare, Pureamino, and Neocate. We have to use Elecare for our daughter. It was the only thing that cured her horrible reflux and other terrible symptoms. Just an FYI, cause I know how horrible it can get, LOL!",2,0,1443806551,1444726480
