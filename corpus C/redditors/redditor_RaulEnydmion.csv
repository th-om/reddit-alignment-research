cvmmlu5,1,t3_3nacsx,RaulEnydmion,"I don't know about all that.  I would take this as a warning sign.
Porn is a banality, and physical manifestation, perhaps a base emotion.  The interpersonal exchange, on the other hand, that is something else again.
Ask yourself, what is it he is looking for?
Not knowing y'all makes it impossible to say how to approach this.  
For you, will this knowledge reside in you, like a grain of salt? Maybe look at the relationship, and be sure to understand what is going on.  And no, the motivation to lose the baby weight needs to be your own gratification.
Does this represent a breach in the vows?  Probably not.  It might be simple jack-assing around on his part.  Again, look at the mechanics of the relationship.

cvjlzch,0,t1_cvjlm4g,RaulEnydmion,"I suppose it's not the sole factor.  I've had quite a bit more advantages in this life that have kept me from being poor.  But I can surely say that, the more I've learned, the more I've earned. 

Regardless, I've steered us away from the intent of OP.  How much of a factor do you suppose that education level correlates (negatively) with crime rate?  ",1,0,1443639757,1444730680

cvipsqb,0,t1_cvi31mj,RaulEnydmion,"I like that bit about the politburo and students gaming the system.  Nice visuals on that one.
Except, that hasn't happened.  Here in the state of Georgia (USA), if you graduate from a Georgia high school with a good GPA, you get either 80% or 95% of your tuition covered by the good people of Georgia, if you attend a public University.  
The crux of your premise is that the state will have to dictate the courses of study.  I don't know of a proposal to do that.  Such a thing would indeed turn out pretty much as you describe.  Probably worse, I would think.  (I envision a Soviet style Ministry of Higher Education and the Arts.)
Back to the example set by Georgia, the various state-owned institutions have some amount of autonomy, and compete with one another for students.
I am a bit surprised that we don't have more students who just take advantage of the subsidy.  I suppose this is because the bar is set fairly high to get the state funding.  This probably results in only funding students who are focused on completing education.
To bring it back to the OP, I don't know if the idea of a FTT on the sale of stocks is the right funding vehicle.  I guess I would need to better understand the implications of such a thing.",1,0,1443570796,1444730680
