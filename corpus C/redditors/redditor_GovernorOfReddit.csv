Definitely check it out! :)",2,0,1444703027,1444726484
cvxot56,0,t1_cvxomln,GovernorOfReddit,"Simon is a great guy! I really liked the interview he did with the [president](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWY79JCfhjw).

The series was very thorough, which makes it a classic imo. I still want to check out his ""Show Me A Hero"", which touched on affordable housing in Yonkers, NY.",2,0,1444702212,1444726484
cvxogx4,0,t1_cvxo1yx,GovernorOfReddit,Fair point. The Wire was very comprehensive and I greatly enjoyed how very real it was.,2,0,1444701669,1444726484

cvxnyvy,0,t1_cvxndef,GovernorOfReddit,"He alluded to it, yes. I've seen the interview and am aware of this. But looking at his numbers and the stage he'll be on, O'Malley is going to need to promote his ideas and make himself look viable as a presidential candidate. Merely pointing out what has been stated every day isn't going to boost his numbers.

O'Malley using the ""socialist card"" is like swinging at the air, imo.",1,0,1444700884,1444726484
cvxnk99,0,t1_cvxjt7n,GovernorOfReddit,"Perhaps. I think it will be brought up at some point in the debate, but I can't see O'Malley outright stating that Bernie is a socialist.

The biggest thing he may do is allude to Bernie's socialist tendencies, like he did in this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBXUGv4sIqI), but O'Malley is so far behind, that any negative attack would look desperate imo.",2,0,1444700257,1444726484
cvxnd9u,0,t1_cvxkmdh,GovernorOfReddit,"I have watched The Wire. While it does get many aspects of the city correct, I wouldn't promote it (let alone any fictional show), as the true image of the city of Baltimore. There's a lot more to Baltimore City than drug addicts, shady cops and corrupt politicians.

In the show, it also stated that every mayor and high ranking official dealt in the corrupt business of ""juking the stats"", mostly to benefit themselves and remain in office. Carcietti definitely took part in making the stats more favorable to himself (and screwed the city kids because he didn't take the money from Annapolis, because he wanted to run for Governor), but he wasn't the only one doing it. He also spent a good portion of his first term as mayor dealing with the issues created by the previous administration.

There are definitely legitimate criticisms of Martin O'Malley, (lack of political will to fix the gerrymandered state, lack of bipartisanship, lack of true progress in cleaning the Bay) but I wouldn't use The Wire as a discredit on his decade and a half of political service to Maryland.

Relating back to my original comment, the issues of Baltimore aren't likely to end his campaign. He can blame any problem on Dixon or SRB, and even use his time as Mayor and Governor to say he benefited the city (he'll likely bring up [CitiStat](http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/CitiStat.aspx))",1,0,1444699971,1444726484
cvx9g86,0,t1_cvx6q4v,GovernorOfReddit,"I'm actually counting that he won't say anything about socialism in the debate. He knows that stating that won't get him a boost. He may try to paint himself as someone who is a ""sensible liberal"", but he still needs to distinguish himself from both Bernie and Hillary.",6,0,1444678684,1444726484
