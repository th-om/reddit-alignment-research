That said, I think these budget proposals are an extreme reaction to what has become an insurmountable problem, an extreme problem. The problem is deficit spending and the effect is an 18 trillion dollar debt load.

I think everyone intuitively knows, whether or not they acknowledge it, that you have to pay a price for money borrowed. Everyone also knows that interest accrues with time, so the longer you wait to pay for the problem, the harder it will be to pay the price. I think that is the simple math driving some of the conservative and libertarian ideology. Honestly, I think the people who ascribe to these type of budget proposals are driven by the worry that we will never be able to wrangle our economy back to a healthy sustainable level where we can pay for the things we want to fund.

There are some who ascribe to the ideology that the national deficit does not matter, and anything and everything is on the table when it comes to deficit spending in order to keep things chugging along. Certainly federal policy has followed this path with the zero-percent inflation rate policy. However, some view this as desperation at this point due to the fact that if they were to raise the interest rates, the interest payment alone on the United States debt would force the country into bankruptcy if it tried to maintain its current level of spending as well as service the debt.

I think people who are in favor of these extreme measures such as balancing the budget do so because they do not wish to see the country fail in this matter. I also think people are worried about the future value of their currency on the global market due to the long-term ramifications of Quantitative Easing.

One thing I do know that continues to hurt the average American, is that a zero-percent inflation rate continues to punish savers who are tend to be fiscally conservative. In other words, you cannot store your money in a savings account and expect to earn a return that beats inflation. Some see this as inherently bad because although it may stimulate the economy in the short-term, it most certainly encourages wasteful spending on the individual level as well as the institutional level. [For example, roughly 75% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.](http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/24/pf/emergency-savings/). I'm not sure how academically rigorous that statistic is, but I am sure of the obvious trend in the abysmal savings level of the average America.

So I don't blame people for proposing we take extreme measures to combat the deficit spending.",0,0,1444584730,1444721191

Subsidies for renewables are a secondary choice, a bandaid, because conventional energy production and consumption are not priced for a market that does not price-in environmental impact and consumption sustainability. Price the market accurately for impact, carbon dioxide by-products, and renewables will automatically be adopted en masse.

TLDR: If conventional energy production and consumption was priced correctly for the harmful byproducts, there would be absolutely no need for subsidies for renewables.",1,0,1443410572,1444721191
