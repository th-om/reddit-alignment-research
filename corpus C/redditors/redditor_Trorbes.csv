cvx28fp,0,t1_cvwq492,Trorbes,"> And trolls can do a lot of real life damage, but on balance they usually don't.

How does that make sense? What is being balanced? One one side you have the relative few who do significant harm to people, and on the other you have the many who do little to no harm. That's not a balance.",5,0,1444668170,1444726022
cvx1fvd,1,t3_3of3gy,Trorbes,"This article will change nothing. GGers will continue to say the victims of harassment should be/stay silent. They will continue to argue the harassment of their targets is inconsequential, or is normal to what everyone receives, or that that they are just seeking attention.

The article describes perfectly the attitude I've seen here lately. Sarkeesian, et al. are ""serving the Koolaid"" of social justice. They get called censorious hypocrites [here in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GGdiscussion/comments/3of3gy/the_trolls_will_always_win/cvwvb1c). They're accused of leading the charge to destroy gaming culture, by dominating games journalism and forcing developers to appease their interests - that their popularity isn't genuine, but ""cult-like.""

I'm actually a little disappointed she name-dropped GamerGate in the article. I can pretty much guarantee Wired will become - if it isn't already - another perpetrator of unethics on their list. ",2,0,1444666949,1444726022

See, I didn't say Israel did that. I asked if you would support it. I mean, if you're truly done being ""politically correct"" then I'd think you wouldn't be afraid to advocate for the most straightforward way to solve the Palestinian question.

cvw7dvr,0,t1_cvw59mq,Trorbes,Okay. Then would you advocate an Israeli campaign of ethnic cleansing in the Palestinian territories to remove the undesirable Arab Muslim element and ensure greater stability in the greater Israel region?,1,0,1444597502,1444726022
