This might of caused Hama despite its historical event, not having as much of an insurgency as other syrian cities. Due to less local support.

Mainly because Willkie promised not to get involved in WW2 and german americans probably wanted the US to stay out of the war.  So compare those two maps with the map of german ancestry plurality.

>By mid-1979, the United States had started a covert program to finance the mujahideen.[5] President Carter's National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, was later quoted as saying that the goal of the program was to ""induce a Soviet military intervention"",[6][7] but later clarified that this was ""a very sensationalized and abbreviated"" misquotation and that the Soviet invasion occurred largely because of previous U.S. failures to restrain Soviet influence.[8][9] According to Eric Alterman, writing in The Nation, Cyrus Vance's close aide Marshall Shulman ""insists that the State Department worked hard to dissuade the Soviets from invading and would never have undertaken a program to encourage it, though he says he was unaware of the covert program at the time. Indeed, Vance hardly seems to be represented at all in Gates' recounting"".[10]",1,0,1444577212,1444723609

However i think once the gulf arabs ships in manpads and tows the progress will be slowed. Unlike most of the year where rebels had made slow gains progressively into latakia and idlib governate. At least still with Russian airpower although helis will be put off the battlefield. Its going to be a reversal of that with the SAA the ones to get slow gains.,-2,0,1444505412,1444723609
