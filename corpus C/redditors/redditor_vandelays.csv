Hilary was far more suited for the office but couldn't beat a fresh-faced senator. If anything, she's grown even more stale and unlikable since then. ",1,1,1444712771,1444718528

cvxu1i6,0,t1_cvxto0f,vandelays,All that means is the Jets might lose to the Patriots twice then. This team will struggle to be 8-8 if we keep playing like we did today and I just can't see some huge turnaround in our cards. It's a shame but a W tonight puts us in a great wildcard spot. We're only 5 games in and we're not really in control of our own destiny anymore. ,1,0,1444711393,1444718528
cvxtio7,1,t3_3ojmn2,vandelays,"Barring some kind of implosion by the Bills, Jets or Steelers we won't make the playoffs. Actually the Steelers are supposed to be in the middle of an implosion since their starting QB is down and we couldn't even beat them. It's looking to be another season of mediocrity and that's a damn shame. ",2,0,1444710274,1444718528
cvxteqn,0,t1_cvxtc1w,vandelays,"We couldn't beat them with their back-up QB. With Ben, that game isn't close. I am not looking forward to getting embarrassed at Lambeau next week because this team won't be able to hang against quality opponents. Man this season is looking to be a huge disappointment.
