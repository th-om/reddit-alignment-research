cvuzezy,0,t1_cvuye40,ROIB,"I hope UMD continues to do good for a long time because I think you are one of the few schools that would be able to poach our current coach (Former Gary Williams assistant, Jimmy Patsos). Also, you guys got a nice grab in Kevin Huerter right out of our backyard. ",1,0,1444501291,1444725601
cvudugv,0,t1_cvudmn1,ROIB,Not familiar with Driesell's system but I sat through 3 years of watching good shooters struggle in the classic Mitch Buonaguro pass the ball around the perimeter until there's no time left to shoot offense. Also as someone with funky ass jump shot mechanics. I hope to see it happen.,1,0,1444440552,1444725601
cvuc5i8,1,t3_3o5zpq,ROIB,"I believe that Siena is going to have one of the best mid-major point guards in the country this year: Marquis Wright. He's been starting at PG since the first game of his freshman season, putting in 35.5 minutes per game. Put up big numbers last season- 12.5 PPG 4.2 RPG 5.1 APG 2.0 SPG. I think he is due for a major breakout this season. Reminds me of another former Siena PG, Ronald Moore (you may remember him from an infamous 2OT game against Ohio State). I think we will all be hearing more about this 6'0"" PG this season.",2,0,1444437172,1444725601

cvd9l7b,1,t3_3m52im,ROIB,McCaffery is a great coach. Wish we could've held on to him for one more year,5,0,1443143853,1444725601
cvaxyg2,0,t1_cvaoj88,ROIB,"I agree across the board that anything and everything should be on the table for examination. We could phase up social security contributions similarly to the way of phasing up the retirement age, marginal increases over a long period to minimize the pain could do wonders for the health of the program. Military spending could definitely be trimmed, easily if we actually tried. I actually think corporate taxes should drop, offset by a rise in income taxes and cleaning up the loopholes that let some corporations get away without paying anything. I wish both parties could negotiate, instead we have the unstoppable force meeting the immovable object. Negotiation, compromise and civil discussion are lost arts. Arts that I tried to instill in all my members as a three year College Republican campus president. ",1,0,1442975302,1444725601
