He could have won Democratic primaries while opposing an AWB and preaching UBC.  In doing so, as you point out, he could have consolidated a lot of other scattered groups who don't feel represented by either Hillary or any of the Republicans.

It's a big lost opportunity.  He needs to fire whoever is helping him with this stuff.",1,0,1444644284,1444718126

cvw41lb,0,t1_cvw29fk,bustduster,"I brought up the 1994 ban because it was accomplished by dividing gun owners.  They got hunters and people (like you) who own a handgun or maybe a bolt-action or shotgun to support it, or at least not oppose it.  The aftermath of that ban solidified gun owners of all sorts into a single voting bloc.  Hunters who have no interest in owning AR-15s understand that they're not going to stop with AR-15s.  Gun owners are no longer interested in the kind of compromise you're offering -- a completely one-sided ""compromise"" that neither improves public safety nor offers any reciprocity.  It's strictly a matter of giving up rights and getting nothing in return.  And once we've done that, it'll happen again, and again, and again.

I won't support a candidate who's offering me that.  I may end up voting for him or her if I find the alternatives even less palatable, but I'll do nothing to support his or her campaign.

You seem like you're a serious Bernie supporter who disagrees with him on this one issue, so I'd encourage you to try to change *his* mind instead of trying to change mine.

cvvmhz4,0,t1_cvvhyxs,bustduster,"> The more inconvenient we make shooting, the less non-criminal shooters we'll have because they just don't have the drive to get past certain boundaries.

I don't think it's okay to infringe a right by making it as inconvenient as possible.  Not when communities in the south do it with regards to abortion and not when it's about guns.

> A bullied kid, for example, might see his dads automatic in the closet and realize that getting rid of those assholes is just a grab away

I support laws requiring safe storage, especially when there are kids living in the house.  It's tough to enforce, but it's something, and some people honestly don't know any better until they're told.

> The deadlier and more effective a gun is, I imagine most people think, the more dis-attached you get from what it is and what is happening in a shooting. In a way, a handgun is more ""personal"" than spraying death down a hallway.

I don't think a pistol is any more or less ""personal"" than rifle.  I also think you may be confused about what our current laws are if you think you can go to a gun store and get something that ""sprays death down a hallway.""  Fully automatic weapons have been very heavily regulated for almost a century, and unobtainable to all except the very, very rich for about thirty years.  They're simply never used in crimes.  The guns we're talking about banning are no bigger or more deadly than any others.  It's a made up category of thing based on non-functional characteristics and makes no useful distinctions versus any other weapons.

> The fact that it is the most supported legislation is baffling, however. 

It isn't, not by a long shot.  The most supported legislation is background check reform.  Assault weapons bans are put forward by Democrats (and Bernie) over and over again despite not making any sense whatsoever to anyone who knows anything about how guns work, and despite the actual data we have from the 1994 assault weapon ban showing it had absolutely no effect on anything except sales of the models of weapons prohibited.

You absolutely cannot be in favor of banning ""all guns"" and have a remote dream of getting elected president.

But his claim of not wanting to ban ""all guns"" means fuck all to me, because he is being *very clear* that he wants to ban *all semi-automatic rifles.*  Which is a huge class of gun that it is both incredibly popular and almost never used in crimes.  It's a dumb-as-fuck civil-liberties-limiting position that has no data or logic to support it.  Why would I support this position?  Why would I support a politician who advances it?

cvvb8jf,0,t1_cvvapgl,bustduster,"No, I honestly don't care whether or not he ""demonizes"" people while he bans the most popular rifle in America.  This argument of, ""Hey, I'm not banning *all* the guns, just the most popular kind!  And when I come back in 3 years to ban the *next* class of guns, that still won't be *all* of them, so what are you so upset about?""

The fact is he's being very clear about his stance on this, and it's a really bad one completely unsupported and in fact actively contradicted by the data.  A stance in favor of crippling a constitutional right (one of the first ten, no less) should have some serious data and/or logic behind it.  This one is all party lines and pandering.  The exact thing he pretends he doesn't stoop to.  I like a lot of his other policies, but his stance on this one makes me question everything else about him.  It's a shame we can't have a candidate with a solid social / financial platform who's not also interested in nonsensically crippling one civil right or another.

Edit: no American politician running for national office would *ever* propose banning *all* guns and expect to be invited to any debates.  The fact that Bernie wants to ban semi-auto rifles and 30 round magazines puts him basically in the most extreme pro-gun-control position possible.",9,0,1444523293,1444718126
