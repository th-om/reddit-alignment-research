I don't think you've understood the argument, if you think that the technical application of evolution is important to it.",2,0,1444678502,1444718354
cvx8281,0,t1_cvwpy05,Kai_Daigoji,"> Except for the fact that I demonstrated that evolution leads to the acquisition of accurate information 

No, you demonstrated that accurate information and adaptive information is often the same.  But you haven't demonstrated that is *necessarily* true, just that it is coincidentally true.",2,0,1444676687,1444718354

cvx7ygr,0,t1_cvwth56,Kai_Daigoji,"Yes, I know.  That's been my point.  The information they use is adaptive for that reason.  But it's because it's adaptive, not because it's true.  If there were a drive towards *true* information, flames wouldn't cause problems.",2,0,1444676533,1444718354
cvwnz6i,0,t1_cvw4kqd,Kai_Daigoji,"I'm not positive where the weak areas are.  It's unconvincing, but that's an intuitive argument, not a logical one.  I think he plays a little fast and loose with ideas like probability - just because we wouldn't necessarily expect evolution to lead to true beliefs, doesn't mean it wouldn't.

Well, evolution clearly seems to be good enough.  It doesn't seem to be pushing moths towards a truer understanding of flames, so it doesn't seem particularly adaptive.",0,0,1444628574,1444718354
