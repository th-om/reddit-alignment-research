cvx06og,1,t3_3o2ew3,Quetzalcoatls,Government is viewed in the US as a inherently negative yet necessary function of living in a civilized society. Government is not popular and is viewed as incompetent at best and corrupt at worst. An ideology that would in practice place everything under government ownership & operation has little appeal to a people who largely believe government is incapable of providing services effectively. ,1,0,1444664936,1444717798
cvwt1ii,1,t3_3oeox5,Quetzalcoatls,I thought the interview was quite embarrassing. It says a lot about Obama that the world is collapsing and that he is more focused on climate change than anything. ,5,0,1444648639,1444717798

cvwm4hm,0,t1_cvwllag,Quetzalcoatls,"Yes, but the overwhelming majority of citizens will never want to access PACER let alone have a need to do it. Why should the public bare the costs of hosting & making available documents through taxes when the small group of individuals who do want access can simply pay for what they use? Isn't it fair that those who use the database pay for its upkeep instead of diverting existing money or creating a new tax?",1,0,1444624078,1444717798

cvwlflj,1,t3_3oe367,Quetzalcoatls,"No, the general feeling I get from non-political types is that they are tired of the Obama presidency whether they like him or not and are looking for someone different. Whether they blame Obama or not for gridlock, it is clear his tenure in office means nothing will get done. I don't know why people think the public wouldn't just vote for a new President instead of trying to change the entire Congress to hopefully work with him slightly more during his third term.",4,0,1444622551,1444717798

It could be possible, it could not. The article you linked to is not persuasive given the author made up the requirements. ",0,0,1444573035,1444717798
cvvsbl0,0,t1_cvvrz7z,Quetzalcoatls,"You are basing your entire assumption that a wall is a logistical nightmare based on some random engineer's analysis who picks & chooses the conditions of the wall.

cvvr14v,0,t1_cvvmszj,Quetzalcoatls,"Obama cares only about himself. He has been terrible for the DNC. Even complicated everyone's life down ticket by trying to make the 2014 election a referendum on him. So, while your analysis is what a normal leader would do in this circumstance, it is not something Obama is likely to do.

Plus, Obama clan literally hates the Clinton's so there is no real sense of urgency to help her.",1,0,1444567714,1444717798
