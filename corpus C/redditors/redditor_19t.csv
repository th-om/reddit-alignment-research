I was watching a documentary and they mentioned this too, and even how they think he was a mason because of emblems found in his home.

It's kinda obvious who's trying to push an agenda when an entire parties ideology shifts as fast as it did in regards to global warming.",-2,0,1442695644,1444726760

2. reform in washington (partisanship, term limits, lobbying/monetary influence),   
3. foreign policy (Preferably one more focused on negotiations, but not affraid to take military action as a last resort),  
4. Ease of racial tension and criminal justice reform. (I think most issues of criminal justice should be turned over to the states to deal with, but demilitarization and mass incarceration needs to be dealt with ASAP.) 
5. Income inequality, increased poverty, and the economy. ",8,0,1442695249,1444726760
cv78a09,0,t1_cv762c2,19t,"Well I appreciate being fact checked. I agree with a lot of what you say about campaign finance reform, despite the fact most people simply don't even care enough to fight against the corrupt system. :L The article said ""the demise of Glass-Steagall took place over decades, amid a deregulatory push in which the Clinton administration played a role."" That was the final nail on the coffin, and even if he was not the sole perpetrator, he definitely did play a role. A large roll. As president you have that ability to veto bills as another check and balance. He chose not to use that knowing full well of what his advisors told him. ",0,0,1442694615,1444726760
cv72tob,0,t1_cv6xjw0,19t," Well for starters they're both in the bag with the big banks.  Typically I liked what Clinton did even though he was mostly a conservative fiscally,  however he is the one who kick started the destruction of the Glass-Steagall which  was probably the biggest cause for  the 2008 financial crisis. If it were still in place the big banks wouldn't have been able to make the risky financial investments that they were in th if it were still in place the big banks wouldn't have been able to make the risky financial investments that they were able to after its destruction.  To be fair, then Bush came in and probably worked with the banks too right when he got into office to push people into buying homes as soon as possible.  In my opinion I'd rather everyone just vote for a third-party but I know that's not gonna happen .",2,0,1442684357,1444726760

cufxszp,1,t3_3ieifd,19t,"All he was doing was explaining hawking radiation. When a particle plops out, probably in the same way a neutrino does wacky shit by passing through things wicked fast by ignoring all of space around it, it sort of knocks the information that's not necessarily in the black hole but orbiting around the event horizon out of the event horizon when the black hole begins to distort and collapse on itself. Kind of like a little burp. ",1,0,1440563659,1444726760
