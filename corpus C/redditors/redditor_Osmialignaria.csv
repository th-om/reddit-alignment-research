cvxubxj,0,t1_cvtyp4y,Osmialignaria,"In regards to confidence: ensure players it's alright to fail. With a lot of new players on a team, you're likely to lose anyway, so you really want to dig for that extra athleticism and play tough. So what if you miss the layout D...you laid out!

Also, it can help to incentivize things. We had a team hard hat that was awarded to the defensive ""MVP"" of each tournament. You added something to the hat (sticker, spikes, whatever), and then it was awarded the next tournament. It's dumb, but seeing your captains award the hat to someone on the team specifically for playing aggressive really amps you up to be that person next time. ",1,0,1444712053,1444726972
cvxu94z,0,t1_cvtz0vz,Osmialignaria,"I can second this on two levels. My old college team sort of did this and I developed a ""rivalry"" (friendly, obviously cause it was my teammate and good friend!) with one of the guys. We were so evenly matched it was ridiculous. I was a little better on offense, he was a little better on defense. Anyway, it really pushed me to up my playing in practice, work extra hard (usually together), and basically enter an arm's race. From there, it also got my really hyped when both of us were on the same side of the disc in a true game. 

The buddy system!",1,0,1444711871,1444726972
cvxpyuh,0,t1_cvxn4an,Osmialignaria,"My dog gets excited! haha

I make her stay in one place on a big field, and I walk about 40m away. Then, I tell her ""GO!"" and she sprints at me, and right as she gets to me, I sprint the opposite direction so she overshoots, when she catches up, I turn and sprint back, when she catches up, I turn and sprint, etc...until she catches up to me. Usually I only get a good 3-4 turns before I can't get enough speed to shake her. So, it's dog assisted suicide. It's pretty dang fun. ",4,0,1444704000,1444726972
cvxpv47,0,t1_cvxljyi,Osmialignaria,"Ahhhh. So this is why your proposed options are suicides or running in place? Because your other option is running manslaughter. Got it.

Hmm...is there a safe(ish?) spot you could bike or drive or take the bus (whatever) to get to and then run? Really though, whatever gets you in the habit of moving and continuing to do so is good! :D",2,0,1444703835,1444726972
cvuo51t,0,t1_cvu0zgp,Osmialignaria,"Well, there's two ""semipro"" leagues, Major League Ultimate and American Ultimate Disc League...but arguably the highest level of ultimate is USA Ultimate's Club Triple Crown series.

This point was in the USA Ultimate Men's Club National Championship this past weekend. ESPN3 and Ultiworld have the games streaming and highlights! Look it up! Men's, Women's, Mixed. (There's too many games/videos to decide, browse at your leisure)",1,0,1444472811,1444726972
cvuo2mk,0,t1_cvu6gwc,Osmialignaria,"It's not always possible to catch them when you're full extended. Hitting it still at least forced the receiver to make a spectacular catch. If he tried to catch while fully extended, he's more likely to miss entirely and leave an easy catch for the offense. 

So, this why you catch your Ds...whenever possible. ",1,0,1444472642,1444726972
cvtrmcm,0,t1_cvtncut,Osmialignaria,"Yeah, but we shouldn't delude ourselves the way the Romney campaign did last time around. Thinking they were gonna win because the polls were ""skewed."" ",5,0,1444404261,1444726972

I'm not sure if there's really a sure fire way to prevent it (tuck jersey is probably best), but just take care of it between games/practices so you don't reopen the same cut...too much. ",1,0,1444323882,1444726972
