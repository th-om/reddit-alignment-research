cvo89ub,0,t1_cvo7cxw,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,"> It's a slide toward democracy.

Oh god, it's one of those ""We aren't a *democracy*, we're a *republic*."" types.

I mean, I definitely agree with you that the constitution should be interpreted literally to preserve the rule of law, but that last sentence. A republic is anything that isn't a monarchy. That includes dictatorships like China and Cuba. A democracy is a form of government responsible to the people. That includes monarchies like the UK and Canada.",9,0,1443994629,1444718872
cvo32x2,0,t1_cvnxg3y,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,"A thing I've always wondered--if a future socialist society, that is, one where society is reorganized to the interests of the working class, without the state, classes, money, etc., does not have any exploitation in this broad definition of it as the difference between the amount workers are allowed to consume and how much value they create, then how will products manage to still be created? Surely some products created by labor will have to be reinvested in production as means of production, just so society can reproduce itself. This investment back as MOP excludes the possibility of the working class consuming this, no? If so, then how is a socialist society, as a whole, any different than a really large coop--that is, the working class exploiting itself?",2,0,1443986974,1444718872

cvniko8,0,t1_cvnhvr1,HolaHelloSalutNiHao,"Yeah, it really is. As someone on the far-left, this really pains me when people with similar political views as me spout this stuff of ""Mao and Stalin did nuthing wrong."" Mao and Stalin were authoritarian dictators whose government managed to indirectly cause the death of several millions. I'm pretty equally annoyed when people use the actions of governments and individuals such as the USSR or PRC and Stalin or Mao as arguments against socialism in its entirety, especially considering the socialist status of these two countries is debatable (primarily because socialism as defined by the early, pre-USSR socialists was very very different from the Soviet Union).",5,0,1443935740,1444718872
