cvxe59o,1,t3_3oheox,bloodfoxtrue,"If I may go off-topic for a bit, I think lottery taxes are too high for jackpot winners... and that's after taking into account the negative expected value of winning. Of course, no one's forcing them to play, but I nonetheless think it's unfair as the lottery authorities try to extract as much value as possible from players.

Anyway, I suppose there's the usual argument that if we eliminate the lottery, then there will be (more) underground lotteries; we might as well derive benefit from it. So banning is a no-go.
>Studies have concluded that lottery money comes disproportionately from the poor . 

Well, can't be surprised, can we; they are the vulnerable ones desperate to catch a lucky break. I suppose we can at least put more ""warnings"" in, like we do with cigarette products. 

>The lottery money does[n't] go to the intended cause 

Then perhaps some transparency is in order. Off-topic again, but I would like the money to go into infrastructure projects, not to pay for salary raises, or heck, may down some public debt.

Thanks for this question ;-)",1,1,1444685379,1444719419
