cvxx5qq,0,t1_cvxo78a,muirmoffatt,It reminds me a lot of Mitt Romney in 2012. Specifically there was a moment in the campaign where Obama was hugged by a pizza owner and it gained a lot of international attention that made Obama seem so human.  Romney scoured the earth for a chance to not look like a robot and came up short every time. ,1,1,1444720617,1444720965

> I will agree that non-warranted attacks of calling someone bigot is not good n (assuming again, that every accusation is in fact false), but isn't this a very low proportion of his articles?

You are free to make whatever conclusion you want.

>Maybe you will say that he does this only on twitter, but I don't think twitter can be very journalistic anyway.

It's a glimpse at how he operates.  I would describe it as a litigating activists rather than a journalist.

I don't mind exposing corruption, but he also does things without a lot of integrity.  For instance, calling people who criticizes Islam a bigot or ""Islamaphobe""

The problem is Greenwald and his ilk is that they don't just ""point out the truth"" in the case of a disagreement.  They deliberately obscure and quote mine peoples work out of context  to paint them in the worst way possible. Even when these people try to correct him and explain the nuances in their position, he will still push a caricature of whatever he thinks will work to have you discredited without having to address the disagreement.

But why should we get to decide that for them, especially for killer whales who are the top of the marine-life food chain.  That's like an alien deciding to put you in a tiny cage because they've decided the struggles of a human life are too risky to be left for you to deal with.  ",2,0,1444419032,1444720965
