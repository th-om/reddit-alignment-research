I love my tuned TDI and intend to drive it for another 200,000 miles but am not happy with the lost resale value.",1,0,1444226503,1444728715

What I am saying is that salt is a false boogeyman and most people would be better off trying to limit empty calories like sugar or alcohol. If you're eating a balanced diet and are not stuffing doritos or fries in your mouth every day, you probably get an appropriate amount of salt.",3,0,1444216667,1444728715

cvq3yng,1,t3_3npjev,omgBBQpizza,"Cholula is great but it has a similar amount of sodium.  I like using chili paste (like sambal oelek) instead of hot sauce. It's basically fresh ground chili peppers without the salty taste of Franks or garlicy sweet taste of sriracha.

Also, IMO a little bit of salt in your sauces isn't a big deal. It's time to [end the war on salt](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt/), and [start the war on sugar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2381335/).",45,0,1444142411,1444728715
