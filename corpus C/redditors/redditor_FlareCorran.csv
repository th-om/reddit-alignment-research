cvxhngt,0,t1_cvxhk5l,FlareCorran,"Honestly, I could make an argument that the church (as an organization) shouldn't be helping those outside.

Its members? Certainly! We're commanded to. But churches today do too many things and have often lost discipleship (the primary command) entirely.",0,0,1444690914,1444717644
cvxhcdx,0,t1_cvxh7m6,FlareCorran,"I've never heard of anything like that and I've worked at some fairly conservative churches in the Midwest. 

I do think that churches ought to do a better job of helping their own members, since we have a higher obligation there. What Scriptural support I can find indicates that all of the giving through the early church went either to support teachers/missionaries or to supporting fellow believers. Obviously, individuals worked with those outside the church, but there's no statement (that I can find) about the church itself helping outsiders.

It appears to have come from Matthew 25:31-46, where Jesus said that the world will be judged for how they treat Christians.",1,0,1444690410,1444717644

cvxh3mf,1,t3_3oi5lg,FlareCorran,"Paul is providing evidentiary support for the faith. To the Greeks, the testimony of women would not be relevant. That's why they're excluded here.

The word translated brethren could be translated as ""brothers and sisters"" within the Greek, the masculine is used for groups of both men and women. 

>They are usually extrapolating when they say Jesus had only male apostles. 

No, not really. The Gospels refer to them as ""the Twelve"" and name all twelve. On a couple occasions, it says that only the twelve were with Jesus. If there were more, then it's actively lying. In that case, we've lost all knowledge of Jesus.

>Maybe it was too hard a thing to preach in those days- that women are spiritually equal to men.

But.... Paul did preach that in Galatians 3:28.",1,0,1444690016,1444717644
cvxgx3e,0,t1_cvxgpux,FlareCorran,"If you read *Atlas Shrugged*, it's pretty clear that Rand thought the best way to help the poor was do your best to make money yourself, rather than contributing to them directly. She didn't believe that charity helped the poor.

While, obviously, I disagree, I don't think even she really falls into the category that Colbert is aiming for here.

Even if she did, it's entirely possible to agree with her in general, but not in specifics. Paul Ryan gives a sizable amount of money to charity (~$13,000 in 2011), so he certainly falls outside of Colbert's category.",3,0,1444689728,1444717644
