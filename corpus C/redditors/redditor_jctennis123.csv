We can figure out how to help our own but we don't do it because of many reasons but largely because of our selfish corporations and incompetent politicians. In my opinion anyways.

That's why we need either a Trump or a Sanders who stick to their values and aren't bought and paid for. Probably a Trump though because the republicans will treat sanders just like they treated Obama and sanders won't be able to get as much done. Trump on the other hand will be better at selling his ideas and better at leadership.",1,0,1444661330,1444720131

We have so many poor and disenfrachised people in the U.S. Let's make their lives better first, then help the rest of the world. There are so many people out of work who want jobs, that we do have to be selfish and have to take care of our own. 

After that we can think about helping those in need from other countries. I also think there are ways we could help them without bringing them to the U.S. 

For example, create safe zones in Syria where they can rebuild their own country. They probably want to have their own country, I know I would. Isn't it kind of conceited to think that the U.S. is some perfect utopia where everybody wants to live? A lot of people from Syria and that region of the world can trace their heritage back for generations.",3,0,1444660284,1444720131

These aren't new ideas, they worked for waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries, a.k.a. that time we became the most powerful single nation in the world*.

Yea, that's not how it works. If this was the case China & India would be the wealthiest countries. 

What we want is skilled & educated workers, not just anybody. Engineers, scientists, etc...these are the type of people that raise the quality of life for everyone else. ",9,0,1444659884,1444720131

Get off your high horse. I'm not going to explain to you why I am 'not a fool' or whatever it is you want me to do.

The ability to actually build a wall is not something I am worried about. Ten years ago everyone wanted a wall (at that time a fortified fence) even Hillary but they couldn't get it built.

To your point about the concrete, I know nothing about that so if you're telling me we don't have enough concrete then I can't speak to that.

To me, building a skyscraper seems more difficult than building a wall and Trump has built plenty of those.",2,0,1444570119,1444720131
