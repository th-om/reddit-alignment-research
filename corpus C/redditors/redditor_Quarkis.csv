From my perspective (outside the pay wall) this could be saying more about the testers personal opinions of the kinds of people who are easier to work with in a research setting. Or it could be telling us that these sorts of test can make a more conscientious person upset and resentful of the researchers. I mean if I was totally convinced that I was taking part in a study based on pain being inflicted on innocent people, I would probably start to form my own opinions about the people running the show there.",1,0,1443376439,1444729693
cvdom32,0,t1_cvcvj8z,Quarkis,"When I was back in boyscouts I was taught how to filter water using condensation. Basically: dig hole, put cup of water at bottom, cover hole with trash bag, place rock on bag over another cup in the hole. The idea was water evaporates, condenses on the plastic then collects and the low point of the bag, falling into the other cup. Would you need further steps beyond this to insure filtration?",5,0,1443185926,1444729693

> It's not an accident that the people who attack traditional values and gender norms are going to become a sterile people.

There are so many unanswered questions here.
What are these traditional values and gender norms? How are these people attacking them?
What will make these people sterile? Why isn't it an accident? Are you opening a eugenics clinic? Do you believe that whites who don't white hard enough just lose their fertility by some biological mechanism that keeps track of their attendance at GOP rallies? Are you just going to start running around shooting people in the crotch whenever someone attacks your traditional values? 

Please deliver OP, you could print an edition of almanacs sorting out the stupidity of this sentence. ",5,0,1442156348,1444729693
