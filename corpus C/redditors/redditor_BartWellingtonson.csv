cvxcnh2,0,t1_cvwc8f1,BartWellingtonson,"First, I don't know enough about Latvia to discuss the economics of it, but I truly do wish you and everyone in your country well. 

***This part is super long because that comic made me very upset. Read it if you want, but the basic point is this guy is pretending to be ""good economist"" while forgetting or purposefully leaving out basic finance and economic principles. He's a good cartoonist, though...***

Second, That Economix comic was the worst thing I've read in a while. The guy misses basic economic facts, the most egregious being his belief that capital sits and is unusable in banks and the stock market (pages 13-14). This is such a bad understanding of such a key factor in basic economics, I don't understand how anyone can respect this guy as any type of educator. I'll go over some other things he misrepresents, but I want to focus on this first. 

One pages 13 and 14, he shows two images, one of a diagram showing money going from a rich guy to a bank, instead of to the construction project; the other shows the DOW Jones index increasing over the years. This is supposed to show that the ""assumption"" that capital will be reinvested isn't true. BUT, he doesn't even explain what actually happens to that capital to stay uninvested! I hear this argument all the time, and it's so stupidly wrong. I want to know where he thinks this money goes to NOT be invested, but banks and the stock market definitely aren't it. If I put my money in a bank, that means the bank is going to use it to invest in other projects, so they can charge interest and make money. CD's and other banking assets are considered so safe, it would be stupid to literally lock your cash in a vault so that nobody can use it, which is what this guy thinks is happening. When I invest in the stock market, I'm buying some of the finite number of stocks from another person who previously owned the stocks. I get the stock, and the seller gets my money, which they invest elsewhere or put in a bank, which also invests it. He complains the entire comic about second guessing our assumptions, but here he makes the assumption (out of nowwhere and with no supporting arguments) that capital is not flowing through the economy when people invest in banks, the stock market or elsewhere. No money, no capital is ""just sitting"" anywhere, otherwise it wouldn't be called an 'investment'! That alone should make you hesitant to trust this guys economic analysis, but I'll go over my other notes as well.

1) He doesn't give ANY reason for why economists support free trade and he makes the assumption that their argument is not worth hearing. 

2) His Miracle machine that turns wheat into cars is shown as a negative because it ends some jobs, even though it's described as a miracle in it's name. Something like this *would* be a miracle because it would take the price of cars down from $30,000 or more to just the cost of some wheat. The consumer would be able to afford so much more because they wouldn't have to waste money paying a ton of people to build a car. Instead they can use significantly less money on their car and spend MUCH more elsewhere. That economy would adjust to reflect this new efficiency in the market, and many other companies would spring up or expand because aggregate demand increased so much. But for some reason he doesn't think that benefits anyone and doesn't mention it... The same goes for the Paper Electronics machine. And he never explains why he's actually upset at having to pay for electronics, even if they are made from paper. They still cost money for the inputs, design, and transportation. So what if the magic robot gets money? He's just trying to be scary or something...

3) On page 9 he argues that jobs that go overseas wouldn't end up back here, but nobody is arguing that they would! These ""bad economists"" he's talking about would point to the same gains in efficiency that we got from the Miracle Car Machine. People would be able to spend more, and NEW jobs would be created. We don't need our workers to make happy meal toys if someone else is willing to do it just as well for less. We can use our workers to make airplanes, ships, high end electronics, etc. Again, he's not aguing against what free trade economists say, he's arguing against what ***he thinks*** free trade economists say... If lost jobs were NEVER replaced, our country would be massively unemployed since 90% of our country used to be employed in agriculture and only 1-2% currently are. 

4) Pages 13 & 14, see above. TL;DR: Please, SOMEONE tell me where money goes to ""just sit,"" because nobody has ever been able to answer that for me.

5) He argues that countries trading the same thing (cars) is useless. What he doesn't take into account is *why* people buy Japanese cars over American cars; he just assumes they made a pointless choice or something. In *his* eyes, they're the ""same thing"", but obviously they aren't the same thing in the consumer's eyes because they *did* choose the Japanese car over the American for their own personal reasons. It doesn't matter what he personally thinks of the products being traded, only the consumer's opinion matters because it's *their* utility being maximized. That's personal opinion and it's a good thing to have more competition in a market. That leads to innovation and efficiency gains, which raises everyone's standard of living.

6) He argues that there has only been one stimulus program (which he makes the *assumption* helped workers, no challenging of his own assumptions it seems), but the fact is, The Federal Reserve has had the policy of constant stimulus for seven years now. To disregard the artificial lowering of interest rates to 0% as stimulus is a surprising miss for someone claiming to be an economist. Literally, the Fed justifies 0% because they hope to ""stimulate the economy"". Plus, how could he ignore QE 1, 2, & 3?! Those were the biggest stimulus programs in the history of the world, in which the Fed's balance sheet increased by 4 TRILLION dollars through buying financial assets from around the world. Whether or not those policies are worth it is another matter, but the fact is, we've had more ""stimulus"" than any other time in history, and the fact that he ignores that is another strikes against this ""economist"".

7) Wages haven't been stagnating since the 70's if you account for the increase in benefits that workers have received since then (and why wouldn't you?). The fact is, life is MUCH better now than in the 70's, thanks to the proliferation of technological advancements and efficiencies we have thanks mostly to market forces constantly pushing more better products and services, including competition from Chinese companies! Cheaper doesn't mean ""shittier"". It means less expensive, and yes, some products that are less expensive than the competition aren't as good as the competition, BUT the fact that there is a cheaper option available means so many more people can benefit from that product type, and therefore the standard of living increases across the board. 

This guy, Mike Goodwin, doesn't understand basic economics and I'm extremely surprised he gets away with calling himself an economist. If his idea of economics was right, North Korea would be the top country in the would, but South Korea, which trades HEAVILY with every country in the world, is one of the strongest economies on the planet. He gives an unfair and untrue picture of free trade arguments, and he's seems to be a Ludite as well. I wouldn't trust this guy, especially when he puts more effort into making his opponents seem like simple evil caricatures, than he does looking into economics. ",1,0,1444683212,1444722669

cvw9hfg,0,t1_cvw6mdp,BartWellingtonson,">New jobs won't magically appear just because people don't have work.

You're right, but new jobs would appear because everyone has more money to spend on average, meaning the economy can sustain more businesses and jobs as well. This is how economies grow, from falling prices that lead to increases in aggregate demand. Every year millions of people lose jobs and get hired elsewhere, and (nearly) every year the economy grows larger and people are better off. People losing their job isn't an automatic negative for the economy and the standard of living on the whole. 

>Otherwise it would have already happened at least in my country with high unemployment.

High unemployment doesn't lead to anything, it's a symptom of problems in the economy. Bad policies/environments lead to high unemployment, not the other way around. I don't know what country you are in, but my guess is there are reasons for this. Falling prices would help your economy greatly. ",1,0,1444600939,1444722669
cvw9429,0,t1_cvw6b17,BartWellingtonson,">that doesn't mean there are suddenly more educated and skilled jobs, nor are there suddenly more educated and skilled workers.

But it does mean that prices will fall, and therefor the typical persons dollar goes further and buys more, meaning they can afford to purchase more. On the scales of counties, it means aggregate demand increases and more companies get started and expand, leading to increased wealth and more jobs than before. Is this instant? No, but it's a definite benefit is the medium and long term. ",0,0,1444600322,1444722669
cvw3htm,0,t1_cvvwui7,BartWellingtonson,"How are lower prices bad for the middle class? And why do you want the middle class stuck doing menial jobs that can easily be outsourced? Outsourcing leaves our more educated and skilled workers to do more valuable things than produce happy meal toys or whatever.

Plus, what about the benefits to these other countries? Isn't is good for jobs and capital to flow to the poorer sectors of the world? Wouldn't it be immoral to disallow the Chinese the jobs and capital they need to raise their standard of living? 

It's all such a weak argument, economically and morally. If using policy to keep jobs domestic really was the way to prosperity, then North Korea would have outpaced South Korea a long time ago. **True** free trade is without a doubt the way to prosperity for the entire world.
