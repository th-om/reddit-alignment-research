That's what I've been saying this entire time. You've been arguing that they're blameless, it's all Bush's fault and nobody else's. I have never once defended Bush or anything he did in regards to Iraq.  But he's retired, he's fucking off in Texas and none of your precious congressmen are doing anything to hold him or anyone else accountable. He's not accountable to me, nothing I can say or do will affect his life one way or another. The congressmen who had the duty to only authorize the use of force if it was needed, and fucked it up, they're still in office and they want my vote. I'm not gonna give it to them. They are accountable to me, if I don't like what they do I vote against them. You wanna piss and moan about how it's all George W. Bush's fault and nobody else's, that's great. The guy's retired, he doesn't need anything from you. You don't matter to him. I'm voting against the congressmen who authorized the Iraq war, you're complaining on the internet about a retired politician. 

Bush said the invasion and reconstruction would take longer than a couple months, that's why they asked for the authorization. Congress gave him the authorization and explicitly said the authorization was intended to meet the requirements of the WPR. If Bush was in noncompliance by asking for the authorization before the invasion started instead of after, then Congress was in noncompliance by giving him that authorization. 

Yeah, Bush was a bully. If congress didn't vote the way he wanted them to he was gonna call them names. You know what congress is supposed to do when the president tries to bully them into a war? Stand up to the bully. Some of the congressmen did, and some didn't. Some congressmen stood behind the bully and cheered him on and helped push his agenda, and those are the people I called out at the beginning.",1,0,1444524648,1444727246

Ok, you know what would be the fucking absolute worst, if you were some burn victim mechanical man, trapped inside the suit that's keeping you alive, only able to take it off in your meditation chamber? If sand got in it. Imagine that, you're all oozing wounds that never healed inside your mechanical suit, hours away from your meditation chamber, and every second you're in the desert you know that the sand is working its way inside, and that even once you're back on the ship and naked you'll have to somehow remove the sand from your burns. And this motherfucker didn't like sand before he got burned. And that's ON TOP of all the fucked up psychological reasons he doesn't want to go home. 


 ""I don't like sand. It's coarse and irritating and it gets everywhere.""
