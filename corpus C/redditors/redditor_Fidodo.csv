cvxp97x,0,t1_cvxcerj,Fidodo,I think the reason why we only get high rises built is because of the ridiculous base costs of building anything. The only thing that's profitable are giant buildings filled to the brim with luxury condos.,3,0,1444702907,1444731248
cvx5lmw,0,t1_cvx55uv,Fidodo,"That's the thing with resumes, you go in, do your job, and you put down the tasks you were in charge of on your resume. It doesn't matter how well you do it, it's still going to say managed X and implemented Y. Typically the only information I've gotten from impressive resume's is that the candidate is good at writing resumes.",4,0,1444673138,1444731248
cvx39hc,0,t1_cvwwj21,Fidodo,"Few people have good work on their github, and everyone exaggerates about their experience in their resumes and what they say. Obviously when asked about experience people think about what they do well, not what they're bad at. The coding performance of my candidates have not been predicted well by their resumes at all. Actually, the best non programming indicator I've see so far is just ""is this guy a super nerd""?

I hate carpenter tests, I never give them out. I also find that it's hard to figure out someone's ability through homework, and you learn much more about them when you actually watch them code and their process. I do a 30 min to 1 hour test for filtering, then a 1-2 hour test after that if they do well.

I'm still looking for a good take home filter for the first round, but I wouldn't want it to take more than an hour. Interviewing is very time consuming, so my goal is to come up with the densest test that tells me the most about a candidate in the least amount of time.",4,0,1444669743,1444731248
