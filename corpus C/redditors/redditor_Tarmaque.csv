cvxam0z,1,t3_3oh2jl,Tarmaque,"I very nearly quit after Birthing Pod got banned.

I had been putting together the deck for about 6 months. Putting in about $50 a paycheck. 

On a Thursday, I got my Linvala and finished the deck. On Friday, I played in my first modern FNM and came in second. on Monday, Birthing Pod got banned.

I had put so much time in to researching modern and playtesting decks and had settled on Birthing Pod as my favorite by a large margin. Furthermore, I was afraid to invest in another deck for fear of it getting banned out as well.

I felt like all that effort I had put in was a complete waste. I didn't have another $1,000 to build Junk, and I didn't like any other modern deck as much as I liked Pod.

I still haven't found a deck that I enjoy nearly as much as I enjoyed pod. I don't play very much modern these days. I mostly play limited at the moment.",1,0,1444680349,1444724592

Also, if you are worried about government spending, there are much bigger fish to fry than research grants. ",1,0,1444507441,1444724592
