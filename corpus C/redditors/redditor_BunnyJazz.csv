cvbui6e,0,t1_cvbr6yo,BunnyJazz,"Then strip all the benefits attached to marriage. Tax breaks, inheritance, spousal privilege, etc. 

Oh wait no one actually wants that. I don't want the government in marriage. I think spousal privilege is bullshit, I think our inheritance laws are archaic, and I don't like tax breaks for marriages. 

But most people like those benefits, so I'm in favor of the idea that people should be treated fairly under the law. You know, the 14th ammendment. So if the government is going to attach benefits to marriage, they should give them to all. The belief against that is the definition of bigotry and enforcing sexual morality.

cvbkc3y,0,t1_cvaj6cd,BunnyJazz,"What is done in private should not be made illegal as long as it doesn't harm people?

So why are you against same sex marriage? People shouldn't be gay in public? I'm honestly confused, because that makes no sense. You can't say ""live and let live"" then impose your religious values upon the government because you don't want gays to have marriage equality. No one is forcing a church to marry a gay couple. The government just has to recognize their marriage as legitimate and offer similar legal protections as it already does to straight couples.

The government has no duty to impose sexual morality on it's people. 

I also don't agree with the divorce culture we see today, but we can't fix all of that through legislation. ",1,0,1443029494,1444726768

Also the pope is also a political leader, just so ya know. ",5,0,1442950318,1444726768

To paraphrase, it said while the GlassSteagall repeal didn't cause the crash, Clinton's hands aren't clean because he did nothing to stop the trend of deregulation that allowed banks to run wild.

Also they said there was no single legislative cause to crisis, but rather a trend that wasn't ever challenged. ",1,0,1442811612,1444726768

The US armed forces are the best in the world by far. Like seriously, it's not even close.
 An incredibly fast air attack (Barksdale AFB, a massive base, is RIGHT NEXT to Texas), followed by a ground campaign would put any military effort by Texans in the fucking ground. The air campaign would knock out oil fields, farms, military bases. You do realize the US government knows literally everything about Texas? Key facilities, manufacturing centers, etc. It would be point and shoot for the air force and navy. Intel is almost everything in modern warfare, and the US would already know everything.

Not to mention how many Texans would stay loyal to the US. 

At best you'd get an armed insurgency, which wouldn't succeed because almost no one would support it, it would have no finances, and it would have almost no where to hide. ",2,0,1440170176,1444726768
