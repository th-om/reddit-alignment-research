Physics teacher here.  I'm not going to disagree that some homework is over assigned (high middle school algebra class, 1-75 odd!).  But, get rid of all of it?  No, sorry.  

I do practice problems in class.  But you know what the most common statement of difficulty I hear is?  ""I know what I'm doing when we do it together in class.""  Well no duh.  Because you're doing it with 25 other student, and me, helping.  I don't complain about helping, it's important.  But you're never going to know what you have difficulty with if you never have to do it on your own.

That said, I don't give 30 problems.  I give 6-10 physics problems and tell them that if they're spending more than 30 minutes, quit banging your head against a wall.  We'll talk about it tomorrow. 

That said, sometimes rote memorization is important.  My students have tons of difficulty with simple mental math.  You know why?  because they never had to learn ""math facts"" in elementary school.  I'm sorry, Physics is so much easier if you can just pull 3*7 out of thin air. ",4,0,1444694457,1444724788

What's the problem here?  Opposites have, for a good long while, been used for strong versions of the original word.  Bad.  Sick.  Phat.

That may be my science teacher brain saying things like ""Look at this row of data that all varies by only 0.1s per data point.  This begs you to ask whether the data is actually a trend or is it systematic error.""  It ""begged the question.""
