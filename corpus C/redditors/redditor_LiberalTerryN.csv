cvxd3ui,0,t1_cvxa3d5,LiberalTerryN,"But the federal government, the entity with the larger budget than all state and local governments combined, doesn't tax property. Therefore taxation of property is such a tiny portion of all taxes in the U.S., and there's really not a mechanism to change this, because a federal tax on property would arguably be unconditional.",1,0,1444683847,1444718824
cvwzum0,0,t1_cvwy2an,LiberalTerryN,"Honestly, his RomneyCare legacy put him in a bad spot for pivoting from the primary to the general election. For the primary, he could downplay his role in the Massachusetts legislation's design and passage, try to distinguish the role of the states and the federal government in trying to fix broken health care policy, and try to say something about learning lessons between 2006 and 2010. But then that leaves a strategically vulnerable position in the general election, where a candidate is on the record having said a lot of nuanced and complicated stuff that looks a lot like it's contradictory or confused.

So he's running for *federal* office with a record of saying things about how the states should handle their own health care reform, and that the federal government should do little. That's not a good position to be in when you're saying ""give me this power, which I don't think should be used."" It's internally consistent, but doesn't exactly resonate with voters. And by that point, Republican voters wanted him to exercise that power to tear down the federal regulatory system, so he had very little ability to persuade pro-reform types that he actually had a replacement for Obamacare.

Obamacare might be slightly unpopular as a whole, but the individual component policies are immensely popular. That's why a lot of people hate Obamacare's exchanges but love their state-branded exchanges created under Obamacare. When ""repeal and replace"" becomes your mantra, both prongs of that proposed course of action are riddled with traps.",4,0,1444664391,1444718824

cvtyuzt,0,t1_cvtrb1b,LiberalTerryN,"I'll give it one last go.

Governments are not allowed to ban (or even discourage) the publication of books based on the contents of what is inside, with the exception of unprotected speech. See Bantam Books v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58 (1963); American Booksellers v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323 (7th Cir. 1985) (affirmed by the Supreme Court).

Your view of the First Amendment leads to the absurd consequence that the government has the power to ban books. The government does not have that power (see the cited cases). Therefore, your view of the First Amendment is wrong as a statement of the law. In my opinion, it is also a bad policy which would lead to undesirable results.

I'm not an ""important"" lawyer. But a typical second-year law student could point out the errors in your reasoning, so it doesn't take much to back up my factual statements about the meaning of the First Amendment, as analyzed by the Supreme Court.",1,0,1444415074,1444718824
cvtqarm,0,t1_cvtlljj,LiberalTerryN,"> That would seem to be the very definition of ""harmless error"".

We don't know what happens behind the scenes, though. I agree that it is unlikely that Castille's involvement would have swung 2 other votes, it's not impossible that a memo or a discussion at conference could have at influenced the outcome.

Nor do I think it would be proper for an appellate court to review internal deliberations of judges in the court below. I think there's a solid argument that rather than delve into a case by case analysis of harmless error, lay down a blanket rule that having a conflicted judge participating in a case is a per se violation of due process.",5,0,1444402229,1444718824

cvt082s,0,t1_cvsz7hg,LiberalTerryN,"> So, it is perfectly legal for a city to restrict a means of dissemination.  Precisely the point.  If it is legal to restrict one means for one jurisdiction, it is legal to restrict other means for other jurisdictions.  Campaign ads are a means, just like a speaker system is.  You defeat your own argument.

The point I'm making is simple: while governments can enact time/place/manner restrictions, they can't selectively enforce those restrictions based on the contents of the speech being disseminated.

There's no problem with a restriction on advertising. But a restriction on advertising has to apply equally to all ads, not just campaign ads. Otherwise we have a problem with content based restrictions.

> And yes, apparently you do need that education, you just seem unwilling or unable to accept it.

I invite you to Google ""time, place, or manner"" restrictions and what they mean, and what the limits on those are. Then Google ""content based restrictions"" and ""viewpoint based restrictions"" and get to reading.

> You would understand this if you actually understood how the legal system works.  

Ok, I'll just get back to my day job as a lawyer who has litigated First Amendment cases in the past, and probably will do so again.",1,0,1444341721,1444718824
cvsot3a,0,t1_cvsod3r,LiberalTerryN,"What you're talking about is known, among First Amendment attorneys, as ""time, place and manner"" restrictions. Those are allowed as long as they're content neutral and viewpoint neutral.

A city can have a noise ordinance that says ""no use of amplified speaker system after 8 pm."" A city cannot have a noise ordinance that allows use of amplified speakers for educational speeches but forbids the use of amplified speakers for political speeches. That's a content restriction and not allowed. The city can't allow the use of amplified speakers for Republican speeches but forbid their use for Democratic speeches.

The government is not allowed to make content-based restrictions on speech, even the dissemination of speech, except in very narrow circumstances, like defamation, obscenity, child porn, etc.

EDIT: And I'm asking you for a source because I know you're wrong, not because I need the education in how the First Amendment works.",1,0,1444324999,1444718824
