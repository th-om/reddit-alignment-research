The good: Generations of Democratic governors (Ray, Gardner, Lowry, Locke, Gregoire, Inslee) and the unique demographics of Washington (75% white), have made it a liberal state without the racial tensions of, for instance, California or New York. The best of both worlds. There is a socially libertarian slant and pro-environment slant (license plates for national parks, endangered wildlife, etc.); unlike Oklahoma or Pennsylvania, the private sector can't just rape the land for profit willy-nilly, ag-gag laws don't fly here, factory farms are frowned upon, marijuana is generally accepted on either side of the Cascades. Jay Inslee wants to tackle climate change, and supports LGBTQ rights. The state is a progressive darling and is attracting lots of tech companies. Abortion laws remain progressive, legal, redistricting for Congress and legislature districts is done by an impartial body; and police reforms are being embraced by lawmakers, the governor, and to some extent by the police unions (although the kicking and screaming by the Seattle Police Officers' Guild torpedoed a rollout of body cameras, and the supposedly impartial civilian oversight body, the OPA, isn't actually very impartial)

The bad: All that money coming in from tech companies and yet the state still struggles to fund education, healthcare and public transportation infrastructure. UW tuition has been increasing at a double digit pace for god knows how long. The Puget Sound's rapid transit system is laughable compared to Vancouver's; they chose density and transit in the 70s while we chose cars and freeways; look where that's got us. The state is always screwing over public school teachers but seems to have no issue giving Boeing billions in tax breaks and slashing worker protections for their unionized machinists.  No state income tax means sky-high liquor, property and car tab taxes, and yet bizarrely gas taxes remain relatively low. Too much direct democracy; some of Washington's ballot initiatives have been as disastrous as California's Prop 19 (Like Referendum 51 Roads and Transit from 2007 and Prop 1 from 2014) Inslee's governance can be reactionary and not based on evidence, like when he vetoed the drone bill and cracked down on electronic cigarettes. Jim McDermott is a clown, Dave Reichert is batshit crazy, and Ed Murray (whose mayoral campaign was bankrolled by Comcast no less) threw out Mike McGinn's gigabit broadband plan for the city.",2,0,1442008405,1444729984

I'll just copy and paste what I said further below:

> Inslee isn't great. Despite the tech boom, the state can't seem to get its act together on property/gas taxes, or scrounging up funding on education; partially because Republican legislators from the eastside and central/eastern WA torpedo progressive bills and Inslee doesn't have the backbone to stand up to them. He also lets Boeing strongarm the state for billions in incentives and subsidies, and screw over the various aerospace unions in the state. Further, Washington has an issue with direct democracy like in California that no one seems to have the power to solve. Finally, his stance on electronic cigarette legislation is based on emotion and not science.

> With that being said, he is pretty socially progressive as a governor. He has shown a strong stance on fighting climate change, being among the few governors who actually do (with Hickenlooper, Kate Brown, Jerry Brown, Neil Abercrombie, and Mark Dayton among others) and supports police reform (body cameras, civilian independent investigators for police misconduct, etc.)",11,0,1441166410,1444729984
