Secondly, the reason they didn't serve a warrant on Jay is that they already had a confession from him and furthermore needed his testimony to get Adnan.  They had probable cause to search his place, though, he confessed to being an accomplice to murder for pete's sake.",1,1,1444714808,1444727575

I mean couldn't it be possible that Don simply worked that day at a different store as he has always maintained?  An odd coincidence, but not nearly as unbelievable as the crazy chain of events needed to convict an innocent Adnan.  Seems all Bob has put forward is some innuendo based on what an anonymous employee in 2015 allegedly said about 1999 time cards.

Let us also not forget that the detectives talked to Don like 5 or 6 times, including a visit to Lenscrafters.  They looked at him for a good long time.  We hardly know any details of what the missing persons detectives investigated, but we do know Don wasn't some random guy they happened to talk to once or twice.

And remember, their investigation was timely.  Unlike us, they had the opportunity to talk to other employees that worked that day.  They had the opportunity to inquire about how timesheets worked.

And then Lenscrafters, too, I doubt they make it easy to just give your son a free day's paycheck, or don't notice irregularities after being subpoenaed.

So in the end, you have trained detectives trying their best to find a missing high school girl who wrote Don off, and a corporate headquarters that I'm sure doesn't take such shinannigans lightly vs. what a podcaster says someone he talked to said.

Oh, but let's talk about the victim's boyfriend's mother's sexuality, because there's no low to far to stoop when it comes to freeing the guy all the evidence points to.",10,0,1444698637,1444727575

cvxeqx3,1,t3_3ohfux,heelspider,"First step:  Take a look at the language again:

> Congress shall make no law...abridging **the freedom of** speech

(emphasis added)

Notice the Amendment does not say that Congress shall make no law limiting speech, only that it shouldn't abridge the *freedom of speech*.

Second step:  Does the kind of speech represented in *Citizens United* fall under the right to freedom of speech?  I'm not going to pretend that is an easy question with a definite answer everyone can agree with.  However, SCOTUS had about a hundred years worth of precedent to draw on.  SCOTUS should have relied on that precedent instead of overturning it.",1,1,1444686311,1444727575
