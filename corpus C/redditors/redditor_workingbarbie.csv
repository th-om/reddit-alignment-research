cvx1w52,1,t3_3ogj52,workingbarbie,"I usually go running between 6 and 7 in the morning about three times a week. What helped me the most, to be honest, was when I stopped drinking caffeine. It caused my circadian clock to reset and now I automatically wake up at sunrise and can't fall back asleep, giving me time to work out :) ",1,0,1444667640,1444719813

She's just not funny to me, so this whole episode felt like a flop. The baby shower sketch just made me want to punch something lol ",2,0,1444660517,1444719813

cvwwnyx,1,t3_3of3u9,workingbarbie,"I would just try to help him see that it is not your son who is misguided in his sexually, but it is your husband who is misguided in his expectations. His job as a father is not to worry about sexuality, that is your son's job as he learns to navigate his mind and the world. Your husband's job as a father is to love and support his son no matter what. 

People become unhappy when reality fails to meet their expectations. The trick is to change the person's expectations, and happiness will follow. Maybe ask him why he expected your son to be straight when that is completely out of his control? And ask him why he expects this revelation to change their relationship, when your son has not changed, the only thing that has changed is a new relay of old information? I mean, he loved&accepted your son 6 months ago and your son was gay then, it's not like he was straight and one day said ""im gay"" and suddenly he was gay. He's still the same person. The use of cognitive dissonance could be helpful as it might get the wheels turning in your husband's head. Good luck ",4,0,1444658693,1444719813

Also maybe start looking into your flood insurance policy. Extended Droughts followed by sudden periods of heavy rain creates massive flash flooding as the water ends up pooling on top of the land before it can be soaked in. ",3,0,1444490179,1444719813
