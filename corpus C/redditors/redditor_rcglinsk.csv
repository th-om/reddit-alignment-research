cvxghst,1,t3_3o5upj,rcglinsk,It's a sign that the Syrian government was weak and might have potentially fallen.  That's beyond debate.  All it says about Russia and the US I think is that neither country seems to think toppling Syria's government is important enough to the US to accept the risks of mining the port in Tartus.  ,1,1,1444689046,1444725566

>SEC. 13. That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defence of a free State; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided, as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.

>Tougher Standards? The interchangeability of every soldier in a combat emergency is an enduring principle of an army's effectiveness as a fighting force. It assumes that each has received the same training and can perform to the same basic standard. That's still true for men who sign up to go directly into the Army's combat arms. They train ""the old way,"" in a harsh, demanding environment.
       It's no longer true elsewhere. Under mixed-gender basic training instituted in 1994, men and women are held to different standards. The regimen became less challenging, to hide the difference in physical performance between men and women (although the Army denies this).
       Eventually, the softness of basic training became an object of such widespread public ridicule that ""tougher"" rules were drawn up. Even with these new standards, scheduled to take effect this month, women can score as well as men who are being tested against a tougher standard. In the 17-to-21 age group, for example, to get a minimum score of 50 points, a male recruit must do 35 push-ups, a female, 13. If women were allowed into combat units and these double standards were made universal, the result would be to put physically weaker forces into the field.
       An Army publicity release defended these ""tougher"" standards on the ground that they ""promote gender equity"" and ""level the playing field.""
       I don't know about the ""playing"" field. But somehow I think the field of actual combat will not be very level. ",1,0,1444421045,1444725566
