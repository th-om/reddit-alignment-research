Dude....she's just not that into you, there is literally nothing you can do to change that, she didn't feel the spark, or find what she was looking for in you. MOVE ON. Dating is a numbers game, never forget that.

> I might as well try for a hail mary.

>Through a mutual friend I actually know her address. I would send her a big basket of flowers with a note asking her to go out with me again.  

This is totally inappropriate, it violates her privacy, it's creepy and incredibly desperate. Do not do this. 

>”If you’ve reconsidered, I have a couple of tickets to xband playing on Friday, I’d love it if you let me take you. If not then no worries”

This is not romantic, again feels desperate and a little sad. 

I know it's hard to understand, but she isn't into you, you can buy her all the flowers and band tickets you like, this will never change her mind. 

Move on.

Is it though? The argument of if a company should relocate its HQ to London or if a new super development project should be undertaken is not between London and Manchester... it's between London and Singapore, Tokyo, New York.

People seemed to falsely think that London takes investment instead of it going to other northern cities... it doesn't, it takes investment that would otherwise go to other world-class cities.

What are you talking about? It is the single largest issue  for every mayor candidate in the upcoming election.

The 2015 election it was probably one of the most talked about issues and the every party had a section on Housing policy in their manifesto. [Chapter 5](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/manifesto2015/ConservativeManifesto2015.pdf) in the Tory manifesto if you had bothered to read it. 

In terms of lobbying, the UK's largest business group the CBI, have made it one of their key areas and launched a campaign on it, [Building new homes for growth](http://news.cbi.org.uk/news/homes-for-growth/) and regularly engage politicians on it and call for more housing supply. 

Labours first question by their new leader at Prime Ministers Questions was LITERALLY about housing:

""what does the Government intend to do about the chronic lack of affordable housing and the extortionate rents charged by some private sector landlords in this country'?""

It's one of the most discussed, debated and active policy areas in government - how can you be so misinformed? ",8,0,1443992818,1444719789

cvo5tzy,1,t3_3ngw5b,teachbirds2fly,"No this is not a well thought idea and would be a huge waste of money, deliver little return and ultimately harm the UK as global player. 

>London would still be a cultural and business capital - many countries split their capitals in this fashion.

I think you are confused. You are meaning like how New York is the financial city and Washington DC is the government city? Yes some countries do this but very few~~not a single country has~~ their government based outside their capital city. For obvious reasons, it's the capital. 

Secondly you would have to move the Parliament... and then the civil services infrastructure so as someone pointed out all the below:

Portcullis House, the Norman Shaw buildings, 1 Derby Gate, 1 Parliament Street, 1 Canon Row, 53 Parliament Street, Broad Sanctuary, 6/7 Old Palace Yard, Fielden House, Millbank House, 7 Millbank, 14 Tothill Street and 22 John Islip Street.

Thirdly London has more global headquarters than anywhere in Europe, apart of the appeal is the mass centralisation of financial, corporate and political power. That would be lost and London/UK not as favourable to invest in. 

People have this false idea that London takes investment from the north, the when a company looks to open a new HQ it's between London and Manchester. It's not it's between London and Singapore or New York. It doesn't take money away from other UK cities, it takes it from other global cities.

There is a load of other reasons its clear that this is a bad idea on pretty much every level
