edit: call me an idealist, but I believe the mark of a good football team isn't necessarily wins/losses, but how well you play and how well you *learn* from your losses.",-1,0,1444536447,1444719082
cvvhwbe,0,t1_cvvhuv6,snacksinhats,I absolutely believe that a Canes v. Noles rematch can go in our favor if Golden and co. demonstrate that they have *learned* from tonight.,2,0,1444535990,1444719082
cvvhmza,1,t3_3oan0h,snacksinhats,"With the pressure - and the very real possibility of losing his job - on him tonight, I think he may keep his job. 

Hear me out: he played to win for the first time in a long time. The U brought an offense that was more put together than all of last season, and a defense that was able to adapt to FSU more than in all of Golden's career. 

We still lost, but we lost with more dignity than in a long time. FSU was made to sweat tonight more than they have sweat in years. If Golden can turn this loss, but new found energy, into solid season I think he may have earned his place.

edit: bracing for assassination from my fellow Canes.

This statement is only true if you're not counting /r/politics and /r/Sandersforpresident. For the past several months #FeeltheBern has been able to net anyone hundreds of upvotes among those two subs. It has also permeated to /r/videos and /r/pics. ",6,0,1443997510,1444719082

I don't like Trump, and neither does /r/politics. I think he's an embarrasment to the GOP and a complete RINO. Trump's contemporary and historical policy positions clearly show why he was a life-long Democrat. /r/politics would probably *love* Trump considering his stance on taxes and universal health care, if only he *stayed* a Democrat.

cv7o1as,1,t3_3ln9jp,snacksinhats,"If the redditors over at /r/politics listened to his policy issues during the recent GOP debate instead of just circlejerking over him, they would probably love him. It should surprise no one that he was a lifelong Democrat. After all, he supports higher taxes (particularly higher taxes on the wealthy), increased financial regulations, a foreign policy of ""talking to Putin, to China,"" and used to love universal health care.

Which all falls in line with my personal philosophy of ""whatever /r/politics believes or supports, run in the opposite direction."" Trump has been disastrous, he is disastrous, and he will continue to be disastrous.",-2,0,1442727475,1444719082
cv7nx6w,0,t1_cv7ncnr,snacksinhats,"That's an oversimplification. Plenty of parts of the energy industry run on razor-thin margins. Earlier this year as gas prices plummeted some domestic oil wells had to cease production because it was too expensive to produce considering the low prices. It's even harder for the renewable sector, where R&D eats up a huge amount of revenue for not-always-profitable returns. 

All of the major energy companies - ExxonMobil, Shell, you name it - are heavily investing in renewables, but it takes time. They see the writing on the walls for the future of oil and the rising costs of exploring for oil. ",0,0,1442727157,1444719082
