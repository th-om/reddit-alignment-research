cvrtmlo,0,t1_cvrdqgj,SyncRoSwim,"I was there that night too, and thought it was about 30% Mets fans in the crowd.  The sections behind the Mets' dugout were packed with Mets fans and they were LOUD, but for most of the game the Phils fans were shouting their chants down.  It wasn't until it got hopeless towards the end that there were mostly Met fans left in the park.",1,0,1444256933,1444727375

The RIAA would not get raw packets - those are not stored.  The RIAA would only get the metadata I described above.  Only a law enforcement agency could ultimately intercept a raw packet stream.",1,0,1443878611,1444727375

That is the long and the short of it.  The private IP presented internally + the public IP presented externally + source & destination port (from both sides of the NAT) + timestamp are all associated with a specific account and logged.",3,0,1443858766,1444727375
cvmkqs8,0,t1_cvmg8kb,SyncRoSwim,"Large cell networks don't use DHCP because it does not scale to the number of simultaneous sessions supported in those networks.  It may appear like DHCP is being used as cellular modems often utilize a mini-DHCP server that communicates with the host that it is plugged into, but the modem translates back and forth between DHCP (when communicating with the local host) and the protocols like those /u/smorga describes (when communicating with the cellular network).

Basically, the expectation is that anything that you can attach a cellular modem to will support DHCP, but probably won't support the various protocols used by different types of cell networks.  So the cellular device or it's driver does the work of translating from one protocol to the other.

The meaning of ""gateway"" is somewhat different in a cellular network than in a wired IP network.  Examples of some of the gateways that assign handsets and modems IP addresses are a PDN-GW (4G/3GPP), a Home Agent (MIP 3G/3GPP2), or a GGSN (3G/GPRS).",2,0,1443857894,1444727375
