I don't really care to argue for circumcision because the argument against it makes sense, but I don't have any desire to argue against it, either, because it does seem to have a slight functional advantage and if your father's lineage has a tradition of circumcision, there is a decent chance that the father will be uneducated on how to properly maintain hygiene on an uncircumcised penis. This could cause infection for the uncircumcised son, so if circumcision is banned, it would require extra education for new fathers.

Just curious, for those who were circumcised later in life, do they feel any phantom foreskin sensations?

What I'm trying to say is that while it seems that the moral argument is good, I don't feel enough conviction, or possibly I don't know enough to want to change the status quo on this one.",1,1,1444695525,1444722278

Here is how you find housing:
Rank your priorities in housing. Location, roomates, affordability, furnishing, amenities. Do online searches for your top two priorities and balance your others.

Want a $500 apartment with a decent location? Expect minimal amenities and a handful of roommates.

Want a $500 single? You better be prepared to commute in and have less amenities.

Want a decent place with a decent location, and a few roommates? Look to pay around $800.

The reason that luxury apartments are going up is that the amount of overhead work per apartment is based on number of units, not cost of apartment. So if you can charge more with less occupants, you end up with larger margins. Once the luxury market gets supply heavy, I'm positive that they will start making more affordable apartments.

Get roommates, folks! Be content with a 4BR 1BA situation as a student or pay more. Yes, the washer and dryer are shared between units. You don't have a balcony. You can't have pets. You are a student. Make lifelong friends, live humbly, and master public transportation.",1,0,1444411462,1444722278
cvs8e6i,0,t1_cvs1u8d,sordfysh,"As someone who was once a teenage boy, same advice goes to boys.

Relationships are built on love. So how can you be good at loving and being loved if you can't love yourself? Seriously. Don't love yourself? Time to be the person that someone like you would love. Then, when you do start to fall for yourself, take yourself to things that you know that you would love to experience. And just like a relationship, don't lie to yourself to make yourself feel better, especially if you can fix the problem.

Then, when you figure out what you love about yourself, you will love those things in other people and they will love those things about you.

Side note: if you find that you may be emotionally abusing yourself, seek help like a therapist or a doctor. Many people have a tougher time loving themselves due to mental illness, so they can really hurt themselves trying to get themselves to love them.",4,0,1444285391,1444722278

Good pizza is great, but I can only eat a few slices a day *typically*, and I still want other things to satisfy me. The buildup to good pizza is almost just as good as the pizza itself. Also, good pizza takes work so it's never good to expect good pizza if one of the chefs is tired unless the other chef knows how to pick up the slack. Also, I don't like any pizza that touches anyone's feces.

Edit: commenter is right. I could eat a lot of good pizza in a day, but you know that I'll be hurting.",15,0,1444273099,1444722278
