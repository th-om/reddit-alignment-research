cvuo0ar,0,t1_cvuenkg,rawkz,"usually the distinction between friend and boy/girlfriend is made via grammatics.

If you refer to your girlfriend/boyfriend you call them ""my friend"" (""mein Freund"" or ""meine Freundin"" respectively), if you refer to your friend its ""a friend"" (""ein Freund"" / ""eine Freundin"").",1,0,1444472314,1444719805

thanks for the insight dude. protip: leveling from 1-70 in HC is super easy and a matter of minutes if you farm 10 gem of ease first, grind 800 paragonlevels and just wear regular ancient lvl 70 gear. you are welcome.",0,0,1444236382,1444719805

cvqnzbs,0,t1_cvqnjcx,rawkz,"how am i a bigger hypocrit than you are, hating on a guy after you bought him his house.

also whos to say its killing him inside? he thinks it sucks and now he can say that without getting himself into a lot of trouble. i doubt hell have sleepless nights over it. 

throwing ""bitch fits"" was also against how he thought he should behave himself in the wwe (otherwise he probably wouldnt have wound up wrestling injured so much), again something he explains at length in the colt cabana podcast. see, either you hate the guy in silence or you bring actual arguments to the table, everything else just makes you look like an old nagging housewife.",0,0,1444172784,1444719805

plus its not like he has to watch that shit religiously to hear or know about that breast cancer awareness stuff.
