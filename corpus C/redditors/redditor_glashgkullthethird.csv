cvxiaeh,1,t3_3oi00c,glashgkullthethird,"My world is one like that.  I'm trying to develop a history for a specific country and region, Talthonia, and it's neighbours.  So far, a major migration of one of the country's tribes toppled the Yleysian Republic in a major war.  Skipping 1500 years or so, the Republic of Talthonia, established after a violent revolution that toppled a long - lasting monarchy, is gripped by a civil war where Republicans, breakaway seccesionists and my world's equivalent of Anarcho-Communists/Left Communists are fighting against each other.  So far, in the 16th year of the war, the Anarcho-Communists control most of the north - east and industrialised south, the Republicans the centre while the seccesionists control the north - western Highlands.  The Anarcho-Communists are making a large drive to Bratis, the capital of the Republic, and meeting heavy resistance.",3,0,1444691955,1444722165
