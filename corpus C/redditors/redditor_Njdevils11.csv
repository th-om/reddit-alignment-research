cvx1hon,1,t3_3oggyu,Njdevils11,"Elementary teacher here. With any lesson or activity I ask myself what is the endgame? With homework there could be two possible endgames, either it's to assess if a student knows a concept or solidly some concept we worked on in class.   
  
As an assessment, it fails miserably. Students can have parents help them with it, so the assessment will tell us nothing; or, the student won't do it and it tells us nothing. If a student really does do it on their own, we might have trouble distinguishing whether a parent helped them or not. so bottom line, as an assessment, homework doesn't work.  
  
To practice and solidly a concept might have some merit, but again we are going to have parents helping out. Especially if we're assigning any sort of grade on the homework. More importantly though, which students are going to actually do the homework? More than likely the students who do the homework are the ones who understand it. It won't take them cry long to do because they already get it. For everyone else it will be a test of will power. If they don't get the material then they are going to struggle through it for too long and end up hating it.   
  
So I go back to my original question, what's my endgame? I want my kids to be independent with the concepts I teach them AND to actually take pride/enjoy using those concepts. This is best done in my classroom, where I can assess the level of difficulty a student is having and prevent frustration, in addition to teaching the concept the proper way and avoid confusion from alternate methods.   
  
The only thing I really truly believe should be homework is reading. At least 20 minutes a day if not more. The reading should be on the students independent level and interesting to them. It is wholly underestimated how much 20 minutes of independent reading per day impacts a child's development. Take a minute to look up the cumulative number of words kids are exposed to at different average reading times. It's insane.  
  
TL;DR I do not like homework because it accomplishes none of the goals you would expect it to.",4,0,1444667029,1444729160
cvwnhtz,1,t3_3oeyng,Njdevils11,"The useless piece of knowledge:    
I was in the auto class in high school.  Most of the stuff we did was basic maintenance, which is why I like the class, but my teacher would talk about different aspects of the car while we worked.  One time he told us we should always use the handbrake when parking on a hill, because the repeated stress of the car settling can damage the transmission.   
    
Here's where it helped:
My buddy parked while driving up a steep hill and came in for dinner.  After dinner he left, but then came back a few minutes later saying he couldn't put his car in gear. We all went outside to help, no one could figure it out. It took me a minute to remember what my teacher said about the car lolling to a stop on the transmission.  So I got another friend and pushed on the trunk, which rolled the car off the transmission and allowed the driver to put the car in gear.  Damn did I feel cool for minute.",2,0,1444627468,1444729160

cvwmxvg,1,t3_3oez4p,Njdevils11,"Born and raised on Long Island, am I die hard NJ Devils fan.  
  
Here's the story: When I was in 1st grade (I think it was first, I was very young) my friends were all hockey fans.  They watched hockey and played hockey.  I played goalie most times, so naturally I wanted to know who the best goalie was.  They all said Patrick Roy.  Everyone seemed to love Roy (keep in mind I was like 6 so this made sense), Roy Roy Roy. ""He's the best!"" ""No one does butterfly like that!"" Anyway,  I didn't want to like the ""best"" goalie like some bandwagoner, I wanted to like the *second* best goalie.  Most people (my kid friends) seemed to agree that Martin Brodeur was the one fighting for that top spot, but just falling short.    
  
Well, I decided to root for the underdog. That's how I became a Devils fan, it also didn't hurt that that was right as the Devils' hayday was starting.  I rode that train for a long time.  It's been a tough transition these last few years.....  ",1,0,1444626044,1444729160
cvwmp70,1,t3_3oeulr,Njdevils11,"I want so badly to believe that there is some universal consciousness that we all merge with when we die, but I can't logically believe that.  The reason I can't believe that is computers.  I believe that every form of life falls on a spectrum of consciousness.  Plants and bacteria having no consciousness while many full grown primates, dolphins, and some others are highly conscious.  All other creatures fall between those.  
  
Computers fuck me up because I can't really figure out where they lay.  Are they on the spectrum?  They don't seem to be alive, they don't fit most of the characteristics we associate with life, but they are capable of thinking.  We program them, but why does it matter who programs them?  Evolution programmed us, what's the difference.  Is being biological the crucial element to being alive and conscious? What if we make some type of biological computer? Is that alive? I don't know, but if I were to turn it off, I would believe it to be fully off.  If I destroy the computer utterly, I have no expectation that it will maintain its memory.  How are we different?   
  
The answer I want, doesn't match what my logic leads me to believe.  We are no different.  Our brains interpret biological ones and zeros, just like a computer. If we turn off our brain, and destroy it utterly, I shouldn't expect it to maintain any of its prior memory.    
  
TL;DR When we die, its equivalent to breaking your computer.  It doesn't work, it doesn't interpret or analyze, it is gone.",1,0,1444625448,1444729160
