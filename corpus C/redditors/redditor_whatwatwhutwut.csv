I think that really comes down to perspective. Obviously codependent behaviour is awful and everyone should have their own life to some degree, but on the other end of the spectrum, if you'd be 100% okay if your significant other disappeared from your life, you probably shouldn't be with them in the first place.

I think that the fact that you are still in mourning speaks to a quality in the relationship, not so much as deficiency. But having your own life, interests, hobbies, etc. can definitely help blunt the loss. Unfortunate as it is to lose.",1,1,1444704542,1444729739

The past tense of ""lead"" is spelled ""led"". Which is weird, I'll grant you, because ""lead"", the metal, is pronounced the same way. And I guess a lot of people assume it's analogous to ""read"". And then the past tense of ""read"" is pronounced the same as the colour ""red"". Which just makes things that much more complicated.",13,0,1444700950,1444729739

No one ""needs"" meat. And you're acting like being a picky eater is somehow an insurmountable obstacle.

>Also, just to restate the distinction, the ""major problem"" here is the green house gas emissions, not the meat consumption.

Which, again, are interwoven problems. If you ever eliminated beef from the human diet, you'd do wonders for the total level of emissions, as they, as ruminants, are one of the primary contributors.

>As someone who studied paleoanthropology in college, I can assure you that the vast majority of not only modern humans' diets, but earlier species of humans as well, consisted of meat.

Which is weird because using the same explanation, I learnt quite the [opposite](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/human-ancestors-were-nearly-all-vegetarians/): Early humans, while relying on meat when it was available, generally relied much more heavily on other foodstuffs as it was a much more reliable, readily-available food source. Further, once agriculture became the norm, only the wealthy had access to meat to the same extent that we do in the modern age.",3,0,1444311092,1444729739
cvs6x6h,0,t1_cvs6jnh,whatwatwhutwut,"> I disagree that it would be the easiest and most immediate method to counteract it because it would be impossible to regulate it given the state of politics within that industry. 

Easiest in terms of effort required to effect a change. Immediate because there's no timeline for implementation; if everyone reduced their meat consumption (or completely eliminated it) the effects would be quite nearly immediate. No sense in raising livestock when there isn't the demand for it. Is it realistic? Of course not. But only because people are unwilling to give up a luxury in the face of a serious problem.

>We evolved as a species over hundreds of thousands of years by killing animals and eating them. That's not something you can just turn off, nor should you be obligated to.

While meat was certainly important to human development, it was not as commonly consumed as you, and many others, appear to assume. Further, the fact that we have historically consumed meat does not somehow mean it is essential to the human diet. Plenty of people survive and thrive without it. But, again, I never explicitly mentioned a total elimination of meat from the human diet. I certainly alluded to a reduction, however. We in the west tend to eat meat at levels far greater than we ever did or would have historically. By your own account three times per day.

Certainly we need to find a way to farm sustainably, but reducing consumption of animal products is the most direct way to accomplish this task until we can find viable alternatives. One such alternative may be a transition to an insect-based diet (which is far more sustainable).

Anywho...",2,0,1444281134,1444729739
cvs63lf,0,t1_cvs5zzs,whatwatwhutwut,"> False. You assume the only way to counteract the emissions is to stop animal agriculture altogether instead of finding ways to continue it in a way that's environmentally friendly.

Actually, I implied reduced consumption given my note of ""current levels"". Also, I didn't say it was the only way, but it's sure as hell the easiest and most immediate way. What method do you recommend to reduce GHG emissions while maintaining current dietary practices?

Consider this paper: [Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture: Avoiding trivial solutions to a global problem](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837711001360)

>These difficulties, together with estimated agriculture sector marginal abatement cost curves that suggests emission reduction from all cost effective mitigation activities will not deliver targeted GHG emission reductions, means policy **focus must be on demand rather than supply-side measures: the benefits and disadvantages of cap and trade mechanisms and carbon taxes are briefly discussed within an agricultural context.**

There are ways to reduce it, but it ultimately comes down to reducing the demand one way or another.",2,0,1444279127,1444729739
