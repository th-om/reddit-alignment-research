Some of the best, most inventive games that I have played in the last few years came out of early access. 

A lot of people seem to be unaware of the fact that they're living in one of the best times for independent game development that has existed since gaming's earliest days, and crowdfunding initiatives like early access and Kickstarter are almost entirely responsible for it.

A lot of the history as it was written and published in the American school system was full of shit, or at least treated one  explicit and limited perspective as the ""good"" and ""official"" perspective for all mankind.

There are scales to this shit, and Columbus went above and beyond the call of duty not just in comparison to his own time, but in comparison to some of the sickest motherfuckers who ever lived.

>Indigenous people' were just as brutal.

They didn't manage to genocide themselves out of existence, curiously enough. Took Columbus for that.

>but as a conqueror he had to establish order and keep the people scared

He didn't establish order you dumbshit. READ UP. They never even resisted him or attacked him, in fact, they started out giving him gifts. It was his idea to convert his new friends into slaves and then feed them to dogs when they didn't work hard enough, or literally had no idea what he wanted from them.",1,0,1444705248,1444724508

Invoking a slippery slope here is kind of silly when you consider what Columbus *actually* did. We all know Jefferson held slaves. That's bad, but in keeping with the times, it doesn't necessarily prove that he a a vicious or ""evil"" person.

But...personally-directed massacres? The annihilation of entire peoples? Not that many people in history pulled that off.",4,0,1444703897,1444724508

Early access exists because these games wouldn't exist without it. Either you want to be part of community and invest money into development or you don't, but the model itself is not a ripoff unless you're confused about what you're getting.",12,0,1444702594,1444724508
