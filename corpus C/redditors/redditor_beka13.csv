cvt2n8t,0,t1_cvt0mox,beka13,I think that saying it's ok and meaning it is a much better solution than verbally abusing a woman just because she's not interested. Being a jerk to someone is not usually a healthy way to deal with rejection.,7,0,1444345779,1444732310
cvqz20s,0,t1_cvqu3ne,beka13,"I think it's best to hold off on scaring her until the laptop has been returned. OP, make it clear you need it back immediately. Do what you need to do to get that laptop in the hands of a shipping company. After you have the laptop secured, then you can address the theft more directly. I think you should tell your parents. I don't know if this is a miscommunication or if she just outright stole it but your parents need to know since she's cleaning their house and has access to their things.",15,0,1444193247,1444732310
cvqo40b,0,t1_cvqndwk,beka13,"Learning to think critically and explain how you came to your conclusions is crucial to a software engineer. How do you expect to convince your boss to let you use [cool new tool] if you can't send an email supporting your decision? Stop acting like the school is trying to waste your time and figure out how to learn what they're teaching you. 

Talk to your teacher and explain what the difficulties you're having are (try to avoid giving the impression you think the assignments are pointless) and see what they can do to help. Go ahead and tell your dad so he can help you, too. Parents would rather find out you're doing poorly than find out you've already failed.",3,0,1444173014,1444732310
cvqmlo9,0,t1_cvqmg77,beka13,"You can crate him for a couple hours at a time and keep getting up to let him outside as needed (wheee). But you can't do that if you haven't gotten him comfy with the crate which you do by starting at 10 minutes and working your way up. Meanwhile, maybe you can confine him to a small room or area.

Me? I let my dog sleep in my bed where he is happy and cozy and keeps my toes warm :)",3,0,1444170401,1444732310

cvqkvdr,1,t3_3nqerd,beka13,"If you want to be able to wipe down the walls in the kitchen then use a paint with some gloss, at least in the backsplash area.
