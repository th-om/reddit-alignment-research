cvxxrwu,0,t1_cvxs2f2,Leaves_Swype_Typos,Yeah I was seriously disappointed when I found out. He should be interesting to listen to with (another Lawrence) O'Donnell though at least.,1,1,1444723036,1444724446
cvxxma3,0,t1_cvxwmre,Leaves_Swype_Typos,"Obviously cross dressers who want to fool people wouldn't be offended, it's the people who are just trying to be 'true to themselves' in some way by looking how they want that it can be inconsiderate towards.

>Unless you actually know multiple crossdressers who find it offensive, I'm gonna take the word of the only one that I know over yours.

If I said I did, you'd still take the word of the one you know anyway though, wouldn't you? I mean you certainly *should* believe someone you know over some stranger on the internet, so I'm not faulting you if that's what your acquaintance says. Edit: And no, I don't know multiple crossdressers personally.",1,0,1444722404,1444724446
cvxxej2,0,t1_cvx4o5a,Leaves_Swype_Typos,"I'm personally just a little surprised at how far it went particularly for the first episode. Seikon no Qwaser and Manyuu Hikenchou had a whooole lot of explicit boob play, but I don't remember them being like this. Not that I'm complaining about quality squanch material.",1,0,1444721556,1444724446

cvxt37x,0,t1_cvxsh30,Leaves_Swype_Typos,"I want to be sure you don't misunderstand me, he's not *supposed to be* seen as such a bad guy in any regard, beyond him being (author's description) ""a dumb pervert"", as evidenced by how all the girls fall in love with him for being the dimwitted hero. It's just not convincing/compelling to me given what actually transpires.",2,0,1444709385,1444724446
cvxsan8,0,t1_cvxrqkc,Leaves_Swype_Typos,"It *can be* entertaining, because the anime's really well made all around, and if you're like me then having naked 2D girls to look at is sometimes enough on its own. It's just a shame the source material is a mess of unthoughtfulness in every regard, carried by a great illustrator and the dreams of young boys.

And to be fair, those are the worst things I could say about Issei's personality/actions aside from that he's a criminal voyeur (and in DVD extras, actually strips two girls in front of a crowd as revenge). He also doesn't really respect his powerful master like he should, but again we're supposed to see his stepping out of line (questions her well-reasoned judgment, and tries to 'defend her honor' by yelling at a bad guy who was being rude to her in conversation) as him being valiant and good-hearted rather than disrespectful of his female superior.",2,0,1444707882,1444724446
cvxrnnr,1,t3_3oj572,Leaves_Swype_Typos,"I don't know what you mean specifically by ""worst"", so I'm gonna go with worst written protagonist who's also really an asshat, and whom I love trashing on.

Issei, the protagonist from Highschool DxD. First off he's complete unabashed otaku wish fulfillment of the highest order, down to every detail short of wearing glasses. More importantly though, he's really a selfish dick despite going ""hero mode"" whenever a conflict or emotional tension comes up.

Early on Issei's down in the dumps, and his two old buddies try to cheer him up like any real friends would. But shortly after when they're down themselves because he's been leaving them behind to hang out so much with his new friends, while giving them no indication of how he suddenly became popular, he basically laughs and says ""sucks for you guys"", and then tricks them into going out with a mentally ill, cross-dressing bodybuilder. I've never seen a character seemingly give fewer shits about the people who were his friends before he hit a figurative jackpot of superpowers. And this is despite the fact that there's no reason he couldn't have come clean with them, giving them access to make contracts with the hot girls he's coveting to himself. In the novels we even get a better glimpse in his head; he actually sees himself as superior to them and that they're pathetic. Totally un-bro.

But there's more. He's also a really terrible person to Asia. He knows she's in love with him, and he knows that he isn't romantically in love with her (he sees her as a sister), and yet he continually leads her on, all while lashing out violently at any other males who he thinks are being too friendly with her. If the genders were reversed, it would be plain to see that Issei's like a special kind of abusive girlfriend, who doesn't want anyone to date her ex but also doesn't want to be with him. But because Issei's male and written by a hack, we're supposed to see his jealous, selfish actions as heroic protectiveness. Come at me.",2,0,1444706788,1444724446
cvxq7ii,0,t1_cvxmti5,Leaves_Swype_Typos,"I thought the taking of the crystals was a good moment to show how unassertive Kirito can be at times. Even when he knows better, he'll let someone else take the lead, especially if he's in a group.

>Standard “Plot Armor” arguments for things like “how the hell did he have the strength to stop the blade while paralyzed” and “Oh, of course Asuna just happened to be fast enough to arrive just in the nick of time”

This was an interesting and understated part of the light novel that was omitted in the anime. While he was slowly being killed, Kirito looks at his (mini?)map and thinks to himself that Asuna is moving faster than the system should have allowed. I think it's kind of important as an indication that the game either has bugs, or that it makes concessions to players under certain circumstances, all 'plot armor' arguments aside.",4,0,1444704391,1444724446
cvxpokh,0,t1_cvx8ebw,Leaves_Swype_Typos,"Since when was transvestite derogatory? It literally means ""cross dressed"" in latin, and people like Eddie Izzard have been using it to describe themselves for decades. It's also not synonymous for someone in drag, because drag refers to a costume, not simply men wearing women's clothes.

I don't know where you get your info from, but it appears to be different from me. Regardless, you'd have to be willfully blind to not see the inherent negative connotation to the term ""trap"", that it implies intentional deceit, and why people called traps can find it offensive.",1,0,1444703554,1444724446
cvxomtt,0,t1_cvx4qdj,Leaves_Swype_Typos,"Whoa whoa whoa, so we're supposed to believe that the overwhelming power Akeno and Rias had to unleash was somehow non-lethal? I know it relies on that every time Issei disintegrates someone with blasts in rating games with ""magic retirement"", but this was supposed to be enough power that the bishops couldn't heal through it. Come on now. And no, being humiliated by one beating is never going to be worse than death unless it results in your losing your limbs and eyesight and hearing or something.",2,0,1444701932,1444724446
