cvxkwuz,0,t1_cvxfp4l,UPGRAYEDD_2,"Also, to be fair, a visit to Yasukuni does not necessarily mean that one approves of the enshrinement or worship of war criminals or the historical viewpoint of the Yasukuni History Museum. It's kind of a complicated topic in Japan but this shrine is basically the only Shinto shrine for millions of Japanese people who lost loved ones in the war. Many people who visit the shrine very much disapprove of the political views of the shrine's management but lack other places to worship their family members who died in the war. 

There was a PM back in the early 90s who said it best. He was questioned on why he visits the shrine when it angers China and Korea and he basically said something like, ""I'm here to worship my brother, not Toto.""",4,0,1444696216,1444721626
