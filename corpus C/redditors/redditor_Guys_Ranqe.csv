Ah I guess my CCW instructor had a misread of the manual. From what I read it's only if it's seized and not returned at the completion of the stop.

If the CCW licensee surrenders the firearm, then the
following applies:
• If the firearm is not returned at the completion of the stop, the
law enforcement officer is required to return the firearm in “the
condition it was in when it was seized.”",1,0,1444697967,1444717656
