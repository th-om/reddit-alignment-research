cvschjy,0,t1_cvs7gfr,gsloane,"It only became a superpower in World War II, the biggest government-run program in the history of the world, when all private enterprise and industry could be commandeered by the government for the war effort, at a time when Roosevelt was pouring tons of money into public works like the Hoover Dam. Afterward built the federal highway system. So its the normal people who don't know what world conservatives are living in talking about American Exceptionalism and forgetting what made it exceptional to begin with.",-3,0,1444302138,1444729731
cvrw8uo,0,t1_cvroi7c,gsloane,"Cameron Monaghan was a TV joker, and nothing like ledger, who I think was the best joker. But for TV and Gotham in particular Monaghan was very talented and more than you really could hope for. He was written with nods to all the major jokers, and that was a very difficult feat for writers and the actor, which they amazingly pulled off.",4,0,1444261431,1444729731
cvrv9ei,0,t1_cvrurwz,gsloane,"You are but you see how elections are won. So these politicians have to play politics. Remember Ralph Nader, same exact message your saying now, and he couldn't get more than 3 percent of the vote. Where calculated Gore won the popular vote. Kerry actually came close against an incumbent, so she sees the path. You want to win you stake some positions you may not hold but you know matter to a key part of the constituency. It would be great if a politician could just fess up to that, but it is a media game. You see what the media does to every little thing.",3,0,1444259728,1444729731
cvrumrc,0,t1_cvru9bk,gsloane,"She's trying to win a primary, which means staking out politically calculated positions. I hate it as much as anyone, I just don't see why Hillary Clinton gets dinged for it, when its considered par for the course for everyone else. How many election cycles does the media just state as matter of fact that the whole GOP field runs hard right in the primary before veering center in the general. For everyone else this is smart politics, for Hillary its her being a politician. It's crazy, just like all the authenticity talk. Are people kidding, what politician is not a pandering, say anything to get elected person. John Kerry for it before against it. Also Gore, get serious, that guy was the prototype of southern Democrat running right and left, they invented flip flop for him, again totally ridiculous to single him out. George W. Bush, a Yale Connecticut aristocrat who is somehow a regular Joe Texan? So nothing wrong with Hillary saying to democratic constituents that she'd oppose keystone or TPP in its current form, when she's probably more for than against anyway. Why does she have to stick her neck out to bat for it right now.",2,0,1444258640,1444729731

By the way have you ever seen jack Nicholson's other movies, if you think that's his typecast you haven't seen enough of his body of work. Chinatown, five easy pieces, the shining, one flew over the cuckoos nest, easy rider, I'd just start there because there's about a dozen other classic performances after those.",2,0,1443582205,1444729731
