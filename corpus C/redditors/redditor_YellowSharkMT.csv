cvtd870,1,t3_3o0bq4,YellowSharkMT,"A-fucking-men. As a fellow survivor of the Gorge 2009, I totally agree with your assessment. Biggest sadness is how little Mike can be heard/felt during Tweezer, compared to how thumping and fantastic it was in person. That was a fantastic show for me - good friends, great camping spot, and the band killed it. 

Thanks for posting this, interesting to hear the details others have provided, about the personnel changes during that period.",2,0,1444363950,1444723886
cvqxodl,0,t1_cvqib75,YellowSharkMT,Oderus getting fired after decapitating an effigy of Sarah Palin onstage was totally uncalled for. I just want my position to be noted for the record.,1,0,1444190090,1444723886
cvquc90,1,t3_3npk8j,YellowSharkMT,"To be fair, he's right about *The Crunge* - that song has NOT improved with age. Otherwise, clearly a load of self-masturbatory bullshit. ",0,0,1444183824,1444723886
cvqqac6,1,t3_3npg26,YellowSharkMT,"What Phish does is musical exploration - it's an entirely different form of music, when compared to most other pop/rock bands.there are overlapping elements, but there are differences as well. It's about musical goals, perhaps - they're travelers of a sort, and they bring the crowd along for the ride. Much different than the whole touring-for-the-latest-album type of live music that most folks are familiar with.

I dunno, maybe some interesting thoughts could spring from there, as a starting point. Good luck, I'd be interested to hear how it turns out! ",2,0,1444176838,1444723886

cvn1pzd,0,t1_cvmj6c0,YellowSharkMT,"Absolutely. The guy is clearly talented, just kinda hit a rocky patch after being brought back up. We wouldn't be here without him though - thanks, Mike! And who knows, maybe there's some moment of redemption lying ahead, in the post-season. Either way, I think we're all looking forward to seeing him kick some more ass next year.",2,0,1443902254,1444723886

cvkidr9,1,t3_3n2n02,YellowSharkMT,"Let's hit the right point here: almost ALL pop music is utter garbage. It's not limited to country, although I'm glad to agree with the notion that today's version of pop country is objectively worse than almost all other genres, even that weird 9-string guitar metal shit.

So Don is right, but it's a broader problem with the American music industry in general, which is just churning out one plastic, shitty song after another. Clearly, money has become more important than artistry.",2,0,1443710139,1444723886
