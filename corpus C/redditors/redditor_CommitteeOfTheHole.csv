Ask Apple what the ""next activation policy"" is, according to them, for your phone. That is exactly as it sounds: the next activation policy (i.e. Unlocked, locked to AT&T, locked to Verizon, etc) your phone will get the next time it checks in. If it's an unlocked one, then you know things are done on AT&T's end, you just need to get your phone to roll over to the next policy.",1,0,1444118330,1444731382

Visit [here](https://reserve.cdn-apple.com/US/en_US/reserve/iPhone/availability?channel=2&returnURL=applestore_2) after 8 am, local time, to reserve a model at your local store for same day pickup. Most stores have 6s Plus models, I've found, unless you want Rose Gold. You can still get Rose Gold, but they're harder to come by.

Apple can do Next, but Apple's financing offer is a better deal, as you said. It's also not too hard to qualify. Just make sure that when you fill out the credit application, all the information (DOB, SSN, Address, etc) is 100% correct. If there's a mismatch, it will be automatically denied. Also make sure that you present a credit card with enough available credit to make three months worth of payments. They will have to put a temporary authorization on the card for your monthly payment times three, and if it's rejected by the card due to insufficient credit, you will not qualify.",1,0,1443937215,1444731382

cvgive9,0,t1_cvgirl1,CommitteeOfTheHole,"Agreed on the Discover point â€“ I think it's related to how Discover enables cash advance by default on their cards.

I used my American Express and it's not being charged as a cash advance. I was told that cash advances aren't even enabled on my account, so this isn't possible.

My guess is that cards that allow for cash advances automatically look for charges coming from banks and call them cash advances.",2,0,1443410167,1444731382
