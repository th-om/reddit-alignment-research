cvxsonj,0,t1_cvxs8u1,EPOSZ,"No. It's 14 for women specifically. 19 would be legal if the birthdays are exactly 5 year of less apart. I'm also not actually sure if it works backwards 5 years, so it might be only for 5 years older.",1,0,1444708595,1444724840
cvxskn5,0,t1_cvwvnov,EPOSZ,I think there might be some perspective shit going on. Plus she is probably very short + thin. The head doesn't vary in size as much as the rest of the body.,1,0,1444708385,1444724840

It's vague sentences referencing situations that this subreddit has shown a lack of understanding on in the past when it gets mixed in the circlejerk. It also doesn't matter how old something is, you make a claim it should be backed up. None of it was. The entire list is full of overblown circlejerking points. 

I don't care if there has been discussion here on things. I want actual sources than the anti harper crew here. No discussion on here has ever been rational of non biased in the least.",-4,0,1444668150,1444724840
