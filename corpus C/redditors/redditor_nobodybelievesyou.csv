I'm not even saying that they won't pick up at some point, I'm just wondering why they didn't postpone the launch until they had drummed up some actual interest, especially when the launch date had been in limbo for so long already.",9,0,1444710909,1444732118
cvxtasv,1,t3_3ojkss,nobodybelievesyou,"How long do you guys think the shameful volume on Gemini will go on before they try to do something about it?

It seems sort of bizarre that they went ahead with the launch like this without ensuring that there was actual interest in the pipe and ready to go, especially with the way they've been promoting it. 

I feel awkward for them just looking at it. ",9,0,1444709824,1444732118

cvu82pt,0,t1_cvu4yyi,nobodybelievesyou,"What I don't really understand about this viewpoint is that the default behavior of reddit is to collapse and hide downvoted comments. In order to be annoyed by the comments you are referring to, which are usually downvoted fairly quickly, you had to either expand them, or change your reddit preferences so that they are visible.

Instead of just changing your preferences back to normal, or installing RES and hardblocking the users that annoy you, or just changing the comment sorting for yourself, you want to make it so nobody else sees them. 

Seems kind of weird.",5,0,1444429550,1444732118
