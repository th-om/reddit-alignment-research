cvxlkcl,1,t3_3ois0v,TrendWarrior101,How about investigate the plight of Aboriginal Indians in Australia and Canada? Or and don't forget Mexico and rest of South America whose Native Americans were purged as well. Why only us?,5,0,1444697217,1444727794

cvw9lhd,1,t3_3ocwwk,TrendWarrior101,"Anyone here who is seriously suggesting this is not that bright and that would have made Canadians no better than us. I know this article is humorous and joke but still. If anything, this should have been more appropriate for the U.S.-Mexico border. Build a wall to keep the people down south out of here since the border there is very unprotected.",-1,0,1444601129,1444727794
cvvzao9,0,t1_cvv5g1t,TrendWarrior101,"I agree, the Texas Chainsaw massacre released in 1974 takes you to the entire whole new level unlike any other previous films. It's bloody and it's like a ""in your face"" when it comes to blood and serial killers. It's like trying to actually get the killer to be menacing and mean unlike previous horror films.",1,0,1444585224,1444727794

cvvwrhd,1,t3_3oc9mm,TrendWarrior101,"What the fuck? The school who did this are absolute idiots. There is nothing offensive nor illegal about that. In middle school and high school, I seen plenty of kids of icons carrying guns in their shirts. Nothing offensive about that whatsoever, and it doesn't offend anyone at all. School should be place for education, not for politics. Too many people are too PC about guns.",10,0,1444580897,1444727794
cvvgpwh,1,t3_3oaexa,TrendWarrior101,"Judging by the video, Tamir Rice was just sitting there in the bench all by himself, not threatening anyone besides the fake firearm he was carrying, until the jackass cops decided to come up too close to him and shoot him dead without having the time to negotiate at all. How the fuck would any sane person think this kind of shit is reasonable?",24,0,1444533750,1444727794
