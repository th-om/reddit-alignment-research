cvso1mg,0,t1_cu8pmls,Altoid_Addict,"My wife and I have been practicing the Course for about 2 years now. It's a very dense book, and it's difficult to grasp what it's saying if you just skim it. It's like when I tried to read Nietzsche in high school, I had to learn an entirely new way of reading English.

Anyway, because the Course is so dense, there are varying interpretations of it, and in does tend to get associated with New Age Woo, as others have mentioned. But IMHO, it transcends all that. The best way I can describe it is, it's a self-study course for reaching enlightenment. 

I hope that helps. If you have any questions, please feel free to reply or pm.",1,0,1444323932,1444723954
