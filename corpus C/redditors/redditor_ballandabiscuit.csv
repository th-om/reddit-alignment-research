Agreed about the Forest. I love the idea and thought it would be lots of fun! But it's just really overpowered people farming together. ",2,0,1444675473,1444725557

cvw5gdl,1,t3_3oc1pn,ballandabiscuit,"That's so crazy that you asked this because I've been wondering the exact same thing lately!  

I'm going for an intelligence build so I've been making a Magic/Enchanted Claymore. It's not as fast as the Drake Sword but it has longer range and does a ton more damage!  

Do you want to co-op?? I'm soul level 50 now. ",1,0,1444594554,1444725557

cvvcs4g,0,t1_cvvbw44,ballandabiscuit,I didn't. Took it straight from the freezer into the oven. About 375 degrees for about 50 minutes. Internal temp was about 169F. ,1,0,1444526260,1444725557
cvvb9m6,1,t3_3o8wty,ballandabiscuit,"Eggs. Cheap, healthy, easy, fast. Can be combined with any vegetables you like.   

Tuna. Mix a couple cans of tuna with some mayonaise. Healthy. I think it tastes good. ",2,0,1444523349,1444725557

cvvb7mx,1,t3_3o9jx4,ballandabiscuit,"Get some eggs, onions and tomatoes. All three are cheap.  

Depending on your appetite per meal, chop up some onion and tomatoe and toss em on the stove. After they cook for a little while toss a few eggs in there. Cook until your desired doneness. Voila! You've got healthy protein and amino acids (eggs) and healthy vegetables (onion and tomatoe). If you want some carbs, have some of the rice you already have!  

Don't forget some hot sauce for the eggs! Also super cheap. A couple dollars for a large bottle. ",3,0,1444523245,1444725557
