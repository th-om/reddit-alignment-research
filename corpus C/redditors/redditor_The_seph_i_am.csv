A) he doesn't have a chance
B) he can't stand out
C) he embraced Obamacare

I hear it so often and it makes me wonder why the first two reasons are even reasons at all.  I really wish he'd have had a better chance at the last debate.  But he has to make his own chances at this point.  I don't put much faith in the polls but I do hope he starts to do better.",1,1,1444696543,1444718088

We have the terrible refugee situation in Europe and this is what you write about?
We have Russia’s invasion of Syria and the middle east bombing American Allies and this is what you write about?
We have Hillary Clinton’s never ending legal issues growing and this is what you write about?
We have a congress with no speaker of the house and this is what you write about?
We have Bernie Sanders, a Socialist, leading in the Democratic polls and this is what you write about?
Instead you write about some vote that took place a couple years ago? The Times Union editorial board needs to look
out their window and see what is happening in the world, that is if you have the guts for it…………………………..",1,1,1444693661,1444718088

cvxdbzy,1,t3_3oapeu,The_seph_i_am,"One question I have is several states make it incredibly difficult for the avg consumer to use/install/purchase personal solar/wind power.  What action would you take to allow the average consumer better access to personal solar power?

There's a whole AMA list of questions I'd like to [ask for John Kasich](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/IAmARequests/comments/3he890/reward_request_john_kasich_governor_of_ohio_and/) alone but that question is the only one that fits the subject.

Although, if you could somehow work out their plan for NASA, net neutrality, and the de facto local monopoly ISPs exercise on their areas into those subjects that would be cool too.  Best of luck.",2,0,1444684178,1444718088

cvwzbb2,0,t1_cvwwr6z,The_seph_i_am,On the other side there's Kasich/Rubio.  But signs point to either Trump or Bush maybe this will be the year milinals vote.  But it will likely only happen when they have jobs and realize taxes for entitlements and support programs suck,-1,0,1444663507,1444718088
