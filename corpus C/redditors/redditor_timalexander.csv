cvnh9zw,1,t3_3n8gr1,timalexander,"I would like to see Blade and Morbius  be alluded in Doctor Strange and Spiderman. Throw away comments, names on screen...maybe an untransformed Michael Morbius working at Oscorp.

After a few tiny teases, I'd like to see a phase 4 or 5 series on Netflix.

It would be a Blade series where he's hunting Morbius, before he learns of his self inflicted condition, and they team up.

The style of the series should depart greatly from the Snipes movies. Think the difference between Ledger and Leto doing the Joker. Snipes was cool tech, blaring techno, and crazy blood effects. I think I'd like to see a vampire style cross between Daredevil / Oldboy / Kill Bill. Horrifying, cringe worthy fight scenes and scenarios, and set to a more interesting sound track.

I still like Snipes, and his contribution to the comic book movie space. He should get a cameo, or even a full character, similar for what they did for the dad on The Flash.",1,0,1443932558,1444723641
cvjrkq7,1,t3_3myobh,timalexander,"I was always a comic book fan boy, but  I have evolved into thinking that this will be this generation's equivalent to Star Wars. Something that when things finally start truly going south (knock on wood) we look back and know that we witnessed an important series of accomplishments in entertainment history. 

Both the establishment of a cinematic universe as opposed to standard sequels, to the intermingling of TV and movies that move in concert with each other. 

I don't just watch this as ""oh cool, more live action Marvel"" anymore. I watch it as ""holy crap, I'll likely share this with my kids someday"".",5,0,1443647670,1444723641

cveuu81,0,t1_cver1ws,timalexander,"I'm not saying that there aren't aspects of this that I don't understand the argument. I watch the news stories that CNN and MSNBC do about this every news cycle too. There's always some person who works 3 jobs and lives in a farm village with no electricity and has an ogre for a boss.

But for all the injustice that people claim on each one of these heart stories, I just sit there thinking that it's B.S.. The odds that most of these people would be fired or would have to be a neglectful parent just because they  need to go to the DMV one time, which may take a few hours out of a single day, just doesn't gel in my mind. Maybe that's because I'm a city boy and I truly don't get it. Maybe that's because I'm a pretty self motivated person. But one way or another, it doesn't make sense in my mind.

I agree it should be free too, and I haven't done the research on how much it costs to get an ID in each state. But if it's under $25.00 for this once every 3 to 5 years requirement to have an ID with your face on it, then just find a way.

I'm liberal on every other topic. Sexuality not dictate how any government treats any person. Guns should have background checks and be harder to get than a driver's license. Abortion is a hard choice for a woman to make. Climate change is real and needs immediate action. Wealth inequality needs to be fixed, and we should be treating capital income like any other income. Religion is a hobby, and should have no bearing in law making aside from protecting people for being discriminated against. I'm a liberal on social issues as they come.

Also, when it comes to vote suppression, that is real in terms of gerrymandering districts, and election day should be a national holiday. Also, there should be a minimum number of consecutive hours that voting stations should have to stay open. But if your excuse is ""between  Nov 2012 and Nov 2016, I couldn't find the time and resources to go to the DMV once""..., then it sounds like just that. An excuse.

But hey, it's just my opinion. I get that it's unpopular on here. It's just how I feel at my core.

TL;DR - You can give me 'what if's all day. But if in the past 4 years, you couldn't find a single way to get a photo ID, I think you're focusing on why you can't, rather than how you can. ",0,0,1443281789,1444723641

They'll look back some day and see a million ways they could have done this video better, but that's only because they will have done even more work. They're putting in the effort and putting stuff out. That's WAY more than most can say. Plus, they nailed the good bars in southern Hoboken. Cooper's Union is great! ",0,0,1441019342,1444723641
