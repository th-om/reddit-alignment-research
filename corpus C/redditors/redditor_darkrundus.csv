cvssb2b,0,t1_cvp9fzg,darkrundus,"1) When is a good time to call dragon/baron?

If the enemy has numbers on the other side of the map or less people on the map while you are healthy. Also, when you have vision control and the enemy is not simply charging in you can look to rush it quickly and surprise them. If they do rush you can change over to a bait.

2) Tips for early jungle pressure and wards?

Ward deeper. If you know where the enemy jungler is the job becomes three times as easy. Have laners communicate ward positions and time to the jungler. A gank right as a ward dies is one of the most unexpected ganks in the game. 

3) What are things to look out for when shotcalling TP ganks?

Overextended enemy generally. If you get kills you can usually turn it into objectives. Late game look for multiple flank options to prevent a clean disengage.

4) How to play a pick comp vs. a teamfight comp?

Make good use of flanks and teleport. Denying vision from them and gaining vision yourself is incredibly important. It requires you to play the jungles as opposed to the lanes or rely on superior split push. You can also use vision denial on drag and baron to get an early pick and then snowball that into a team fight.
5) What is the importance of top lane turret, and is it worth trading it for dragon and kills botlane
In this case the tp was good but you should have backed off once the turn failed. 2 kill is worth about as much as a turret and turrets remain on the map to take. I would lose my top tower for two kills and a drag 100% of the time


I feel Diana should definitely have tp and Lux would also like it especially as a team game. 

Standard fan start. Don’t understand why j4 warded where he did. (red buff brush).

3:11: j4 wards river brush and then takes scuttle. That’s redundant, place that ward deeped into red jungle. near wraiths.

3:20: j4 comes for a gank through a ward. You should’ve told him about the ward and timed it.

3:35: Diana should not be so shoved with j4 showing top, no tp, and no ward placed. She even cheats towards the top side where Gragas should be known to be. If j4 had placed the ward at 3:11 better diana probably would not have died as well.

3:58: Bot lane ward expires. Was placed either too late (for blue buff to gank) or too early (for double buff topside to gank). Even if you thought he started top side for some reason (you knew he started bot), this ward was about 15 seconds too early.

4:40: Diana should tell you top side river was warded by lux based on her route.

5:00: bot ward is good. Should be in brush though as gragas can go over walls, especiallyif j4 is doing scuttle

7:20: Good gank by gragas but vlad doesn’t bother to tp. If vlad isn’t going to tp idk why youu would commit. Super bad enemy comms. Good tp by mao here.

7:40: Vlad tped top?! His team is contesting drag. What a greedy guy.

7:45: You need to turn here. Continuing drag is way too risky especially as vlad can still tp. even though vlad hates his team.

8:00: returning to drag is super risky here. Should probably just back off after turn failed. If diana had tp she could’ve flanked to really destroy them.

8:18: This is why you don’t take 50-50s. If you are gonna force drag ali should headbutt gragas away once it hits a certain point. Probably about 900-1k in this case, then you all burst.

8:25: Lux could have killed j4 here. Idk why she didn’t

8:55: Vlad got tons of cs up and a top turret while they stole drag. Somehow mao is still even though.  Massive swing.

9:40: lux backs off from mao roam. This should signal a ward in river.

10:10: Diana say gragas go into this brush. Idk why she dies. Also some serious greed with flash.

11:39: Good kill on vlad but risky af as gragas should’ve been there and you didn’t see him recently. At this point it should be obvious vlad is a super greedy player

11:50: Bot lane sees lux coming down. Why not run?

12:00 Lux uses ult on ulted cow. Vlad tps top again like a greedy mofo. Why vlad why

12:55: You guys took 5 tower shots :O Now you can;t take the tower safely

13:10: Maokai caught looking at base while braum wards the brush, dies for it.

13:30 trist should have stayed to hold tower at this point. For some reason enemy leaves.

You guys need to buy more pinks and use them better. At this point they have vision in both jungles. Also check those weird bushes for pinks occasionally

14:55: Your bot lane should have died here. Idk why vlad was so scared with team collapsing

15:30: Way too risky while team is seen near drag. Very bad split here. Should’ve all turned to drag and rushed it imo.

16:55: Why flash q here? Just let them base.

17:55: good punish of vlad’s greed. Diana split is much better with tp though.

I don’t think mao should’ve rushed righteous glory as they have good disengage anyways and tons of magic damage. He should’ve just gone super tank mr.

19:00: Teamfight call was good but super poorly executed. Pick one champ to focus and go for them.

19:05: At this point you should disengage instead of recommiting. You are down both ults and a player and vlad was heading your way.

19:20: Why go back in as ali?

19:40: Trist should either back off further or just b. She is liable to be dove. She walked back to base?

20:24: You have numbers. Look to get deep vision in one side of the jungle (probably top).

20:40: How did alistar even get there?

21:20: j4 just missed a pink ward that has been there 10 minutes. Need to check those brushes and watch your character instead of getting caught gazing.

21:47: You seems them rotating bot, why not just shove mid? You know corki won’t be there. Responding bot to slow gets you nothing.

24:00: gave up drag for nothing. Should have at least got baron vision. Why send your support and adc bot at this point? It should be top laner as baron is a real risk especially with both bot.

24:05: Why did the enemy just not force baron and turn on you? Was an easy call.

24:30: Another chance to seriously pressure baron for the enemy that is not used. This bot rotation is pointless. A tp on diana would be good for a 1-3-1 right about now too.

25:00-25:30: no reason for mao to group here with tp up as vlad will have to tp in as well. Pressure in mid lane with mao instead.

25:45: The enemy abandons the pointless siege bot.

27:20: Not sure why to force here. If vlad just responds you will probably lose the fight.

27:35: That was a horrid split by the enemy and a super slow response by vlad. 
28:00: 2 for 1 was about the best you could hope for there and nothing to get off it with tp down for 5 minutes. Those 5 minutes can hurt a lot. Would’ve been much better if diana had tp for another flank. Should have at least grabbed vision control around something.

28:30: enemy finally starts pressuring baron. This is where you need to use the sneaky baron wards.

32:30: with vlad bot. you need to sweep baron and try to force the tp. The opponent really should have done this while there was a disparity though.

33:40: Vlad y u no tp? Enemy also could have forced onto baron and traded inhib for inhib + nash. A risky call that worked.

34:20: RIp vlad. Should not have been a 1 for 1 there

35:45: I don’t know why they didn’t go feel burst on baron here. I guess they viewed it as too risky. They had it at half while lux and gragas did not dps and corki missed 3 seconds of dps. If they had really rushed it I think it would’ve been fine for them. Someone on your team (j4) should not have backed to try and prevent a nash rush. Mao also could have tped to pink ward to force a fight which I think would’ve been good.

37:40: Good use of drag to get inhib. I love doing the same move. This is why you don’t drag when you don’t have wave control mid.

General: 

Use sweepers more liberally especially when upgraded. Should use almost off cooldown unless you need for an objective soon. 

Check them brushes for pinks. One lived over 20 minutes. 

Communicate ward locations among the team. This helps with vision control and sweeping.


Be grateful vlad is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo greedy.

Take advantage of each other’s wards to maintain a strong net of vision especially early game. 

Run TP on Diana.

Buy more pinks and use them better. Many of your pink wards bought were placed in low impact spots where a sweeper would’ve been better to use. Also, defend your pinks 3 is equal in value to a kill.",1,0,1444330062,1444716684

1:55: Why not do krugs here? I feel like sivir bard has a pretty good clear on krugs. 

2:18: bard walks into melee range for braum. I’m not sure why he did that but you did about everything you could here. I think the heal is fine as with ignite you risk bard’s flash and a possible kill though maybe you could save it as kalista has w only.

2:30: Seems like a strange angle for the q when you could’ve just aimed at both of them.

3:30 elise ganks lvl 2 and you don’t just leave. Seems super risky, we shall see what happens. 

4:50 ends in a 2 for 1. I definitely think the flash into braum was greedy as you know he has his e, I would probably show him more respect. Bot lane is now way behind. I think you should’ve called gragas down to relieve pressure sooner and then look to back. If he didn’t come I would just give up 5-6 cs and back as staying will get you denied more than that over a longer period and you risk the dive that happened. You would end up behind but you don’t risk a massive snowball and sivir has plenty of utility.

5:10: you go avarice blade and kalista goes vamp boots. I think turning this into a farm lane is probably correct, but you definitely needed a pot here I think since you had the gold. You risk them just constantly trading and outsustaining you. 

5:40: At this point I think you should play safe and let bard roam. Sivir can do ok solo.

6:10: A very well planned gank but you just didn’t have the dmg with averice blade. If you knew this was coming I think you should have waited for pickaxe but if it wasn’t planned it just seems unfortunate and wp by the enemy. Bot lane traded kills though so it’s ok overall.

6:45 a dive here seems super risky. You have no dmg through braum e and bard has no hp. He can also deny the stun with his e.

6:50: I think it’s a good thing bard q missed. Bard should’ve just backed to recover health now you have no way to lane when kalista is back.

7:15: bard is sticking around. This has like a 70% chance of giving the enemy a kill.

8:00: He could’ve simply walked back by now and it’s not like him being there allowed you a single cs. They decide not to dive, I probably would have. Maybe they want kalista 6 from next wave.

8:28: A pity he didn’t just back.

8:35: Why are you still under tower? Either b or back off further so they don’t see you and try to dive. 90% you die here.

8:50: RIP

9:30: A 2 for 1 in your team’s favor due to tp advantage. Kalista had an easy escape if she just ran away though. Should not have worked out like this. should’ve been a 1 for 1 that put you out of the game and got renekton back in.

10:05: Kalista is going bt over bork. Seems silly to me especially as she comes into lane with 1.1k gold.

10:20: What is elise doing? This isn’t the kind of play that works after 6 minutes.

11:30: A freeze here seems smart. A pity it couldn’t happen.

12:42: Idk why bards tries to trade here. This is clearly just a survive and farm lane for you guys while Darius carries.

13:00: You should have blue trinket by now. Probably should be able to shield braum ult.

13:20: You should just push bot with darius instead of chasing. 

13:45: should have never happened. Either could have pushed bto and may have gotten tower if enemy did not rotate. You knew Elise and renekton were nearby but kept going. Ping Darius off instead of following him.

14:00: Ekko tps into what he knows is a 1v4. Worth?

14:10: Not sure why enemy did not kill him and take tower. They knew he was alone

16:00: Big teamfights start happening here. I can’t really help you with this.

Overall, the main thing I saw from you was you greeded for cs in a situation that seems obviously dangerous instead of simply playing it safe. Most of the problems in the lane seemed to originate from the support without you being able to do much.",1,0,1444325870,1444716684
cvsnlml,0,t1_cvpbr1l,darkrundus,"
What did I do wrong in order to give first blood?
	You walked right into a leona jinx. This is a lane you need to be reactive against at lvl 2+ as janna. You will never be able to kill them, you just want to wait for late game or a jungle gank. When you are trading you also path very poorly. If you stand behind the minions it is slightly safer than looping around them to fight.
What items should I build Janna? Or Support in overall.
	gp10, sighstone, mobi boots, flex. Items like locket, zeke’s are always good but others can be situationally useful. Don’t rush talisman. You should have at least mobi boots and sightstone before you grab the last upgrade. Also realize grabbing the first upgrade right away is an incredibly greedy build.
What is the order of the abilities.
	e or q lvl 1, the other lvl 2. w lvl 3 or 4 max e first, w second, q third. 
How can I manage to poke and punish for CS correctly?
	As janna you have to trade with your adc. You can also use your e to mitigate their damage and increase your auto damage. You should never walk into a 1v2 as that’s asking for death
Why my ult never worked right?
	you are probably moving right afterwards. after pressing r make sure not to use any other abilities or move around if you want the healing. Also don’t press r again



Why are you running heal? You should always run either exhaust or ignite + flash. Heal is ok ONLY if your adc is not running heal for some reason.

Make sure your runes and masteries are correct. Check out probuilds.net and use the most common runes and mastery setup from there for your champ. champion.gg most frequent pages are also a good substitute (don’t use the highest win percentage as those can be incredibly weird setups).

Your masteries are definitely off as you only have 3 pots not 4. Standard is 0/9/21.

2:00-2:30: As Janna vs leona throw as many autos as possible lvl 1. Make sure not to take too much minion damage. If you can’t hit an enemy you should be autoing minions to get lvl 2 first. Be sure not to push too hard though as it can let them freeze or reset the wave.

Never grab w lvl. Either grab q or e.
You always want to have q and e available lvl 2. q is especially important vs leona.

As janna you generally never want to be in the front. You should sit in the back and support your team as much as possible.

Based on how you seem to want to play janna I highly recommend trying out sona as she seems to fit your playstyle more. You could also try some melee supports like nautilus or leona.

If you want to support I’d check out some guides on warding and vision. It’s one of the best ways to influence the game as a support.

This game I would say you played very poorly early on then did ok (meaning about what I would expect based on the level of the game) later on. You need to know when to respect your opponents more as you tended to trade even when they could kill you (and get punished for it). 

If you have any more general or specific questions, feel free to ask. :)",1,0,1444323272,1444716684
