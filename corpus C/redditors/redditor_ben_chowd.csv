cvj80yo,1,t3_3mxe14,ben_chowd,">When the Guardian spoke to Staver last week, the activist and attorney said he knew the pope was “personally following the Kim Davis situation”.
  
>Asked how he knew, Staver replied: “I just know, trust me, I just know. He is very aware of it, and no doubt his comments [in his Congress address, about religious liberty] refer to that, and also Obamacare. These issues are certainly behind his comments...”   
  
So according to Kim Davis' attorney, the Pope is following her story very closely and also opposes Obamacare...right.  
  
What may have happened is that the Pope was to meet with a prominent Christian group at the Vatican embassy and that group brought Davis along.  It seems unlikely that he would have purposely requested her presence.

cvinrim,1,t3_3mucl4,ben_chowd,"I went kayaking once at a nearby river with some friends. We stopped at this one popular point where there is a cliff jump and the entire area was littered with several hundred beer cans. A pristine secluded oasis polluted with filth.  I picked up a few and tossed them in my kayak. My friends teased me about picking up garbage but I kept on collecting them. They told me to stop so that we could continue down the river but I was determined to remove them all. Then one friend started helping and the others soon followed.  
  
  Within just 10 minutes we cleared the entire area. ",1,0,1443567256,1444730382
