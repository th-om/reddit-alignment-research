cvx9cky,1,t3_3ofzcj,LeChuckly,"Does it seem to anybody else that folks on the right have a tendency to fixate on individuals as opposed to groups? 

Example - this law was obviously written and passed by California's legislature. The governor is just rubber stamping it. Clearly - a large group of people supported this idea. But the right-side-vitriol flows to the governor. 
 
Obama catches flak in alot the same way. It's Obama's spending problem (despite congress setting the budget), it's Obama's Planned Parenthood agenda (despite congress passing laws to donate to PP). 

I know the left does it too - but I feel as a general rule that liberals will focus on group of people or a way of thinking they don't like - while people on the right need to find a single person to associate with what they don't like. ",4,0,1444678543,1444721226

That wasn't the spirit of my post though. I can't stand to see this pro-Putin shit - particularly when it's implied that he's a better leader than Obama. 

In all fairness to ANY American president - Putin uses the power of his office to silence or even kill dissent. Even our worst Presidents don't do that. Putin's style of leadership is inherently un-American. 

My bad for being hypocritical in my argument - but Putin is stilll a douche. ",0,0,1444673232,1444721226
