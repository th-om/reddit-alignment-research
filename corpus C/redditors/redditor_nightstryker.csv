cvw3nfu,0,t1_cvvwm53,nightstryker,">Nobody has seriously suggested a policy of taking away citizen's guns

Eh? Big name politicians, including the President of the United States, speak very favorably of the Australian solution. That is, mandatory buybacks of tons of kinds of guns. Senator Dianne Feinstein is on the record as wanting complete civilian disarmament in 1994 instead of the Assault Weapons Ban (""Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in. The votes weren't there.""). I think it was VP Biden who said (granted during the 90s, but still) ""Banning guns is an idea whose time has come."" So it's either incredibly disingenuous or incredibly ignorant (in the dictionary definition of the term) to claim that ""Nobody has seriously suggested a policy of taking away citizen's guns.""",6,0,1444591909,1444719893

USAID is hiring them like crazy, or were s year ago anyway. And once you're in, it's a TON easier to move within the agency to the spot you want than to get hired in for it directly.

Mizzou is possible but will be tough.  The bowl depends entirely on who we get.  I'm cautiously projecting 8-5 at this point, losing both Mizzou and Bama but winning a Nobody Bowl.",4,0,1444535270,1444719893
