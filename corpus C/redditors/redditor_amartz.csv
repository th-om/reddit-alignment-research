cvxnx4f,0,t1_cvx9vd0,amartz,"Vince Gilligan said during his interview with Marc Maron that he had to admit he couldn't tell the difference recently when someone tested him on it. It was more of an attachment to analog than an actual quality issue. He's used digital since. Robert Rodriguez used to be a film evangelist too but converted to digital some time before his double-feature with Tarantino. He says you really can't tell the difference anymore and digital allows more freedom. 

Nolan and Tarantino have a romantic connection to film, the process and the scarcity it creates on set. But when Vince Gilligan can't tell the difference anymore, any difference is really small.

I don't think that Putin is doing this to get a reaction from Obama. The machismo, the historic Syrian relationship, the national distraction from a shaky economy - any of these are sufficient to explain what's going on. But I believe getting involved because the act inherently looks like a ""challenge"" is a mistake. We'll be happy when Putin's posture is not longer enough to obscure Russia's delicate position.
