I thought about it. Sure the krogan have destructive tendencies and a culture of violence, and yes they have risen against the galaxy before. 

These are the best reasons not to, and it absolutely is a difficult choice morally and strategically.

However, I thought in the moment. The Reapers are here, now, wreaking havoc and killing billions upon billions of innocents. In order to regain some initiative it made the most sense to make use of the galaxy's most fearsome warriors.

It seemed like the most likely scenario would be that they all got wiped out anyway. If the galaxy pulled through, we'd have that camaraderie and ideally each race would have to work with the others to rebuild. Krogan society could very much be changed by the crucible of a galactic massacre of all life.",2,0,1444688759,1444724578
