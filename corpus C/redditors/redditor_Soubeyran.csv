cv1dijb,0,t1_cv18ojm,Soubeyran,"I like that this sub has a higher variety of political opinions than others on Reddit but some people need to chill out and show some respect for each other. Convincing, rational, informed statements ought to be upvoted -- or just honest opinions when asked for them -- not insults or arrogant missives.  I particularly hate when I see a comment  I agree with includes some sneering remark meant to belittle the original poster. Totally unnecessary and then the discussion just devolves into pettiness.

culelzq,0,t1_cule8ex,Soubeyran,It wasn't this interview specifically but Tarantino answers the same way! He is very critical of Wes Anderson's direction of the film which stuck with me because I like Tarantino and I like Scream too so I wonder what Tarantino thought he could do better.,17,0,1440988028,1444729092
