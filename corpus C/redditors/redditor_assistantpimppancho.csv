My boyfriend is a very charming guy and he told me once that he loved me because I make him laugh and he doesn't feel like he's just entertaining me.  I laughed because I felt the same way. You need someone you enjoy being around, don't just settle for anyone who will have you. ",3,0,1444711711,1444730416
cvxrczs,1,t3_3oh76v,assistantpimppancho,I went to a campaign meeting on Saturday that several college kids attended specifically to tell us that they're scared to go to school.

cvh6ok4,0,t1_cvh3lcx,assistantpimppancho,I agree. I'm an extremely liberal liberal and I often make the mistake of assuming other liberals care about black people or Muslim people when they don't.
