Cops pull up their police cruiser less than 5 feet from him (it would put me in the mindset of I almost got run over) and he knows why they are there, so his first thought is to give them the toy.  So he pulls it out.

In the same vein as drunk driving can become a manslaughter charge.  The conscious decision to engage tamir in the way they did ultimately led to his death.",2,0,1444683000,1444722823

Show me charities that would cure charities and show me with data that if only government just got out of the welfare business they would suddenly be able to cure poverty.   

Meanwhile I'll point you to the faq, on r/basicincome.  Where there is a data backed solution to poverty,  that doesn't require a bloody transition.  ",2,0,1443477679,1444722823
cvhd70y,0,t1_cvhcuia,cornelius2008,"That's not a fair assessment, the standard of living has grown substantially.   

But looking at the large aid institutions I'm not confident in their track record.  Charities are free to experiment now and by and large the data shows they haven't been able to cure poverty either, what you're pretty much saying is if they just had more money they'd be able to do it.   Which doesn't hold water when you realize they haven't been able to remotely do it.  What community can you point to that now has no poverty?",1,0,1443476317,1444722823

cvhc5ev,0,t1_cvhal8b,cornelius2008,"I don't see a mechanism for government removal in the works now or ever.  Anarchy has never prevailed once governed civilization became the norm.

I do think if the government completely absolved itself of all welfare millions would die in the transition to the government picking up welfare again.  Charities always came up short in supplying needs and the gamble of ""charities have always been limited by the existence of welfare"" is too great to attempt.  Now if we had evidence that showed communities eliminating poverty you'd have my ear. ",0,0,1443474684,1444722823
