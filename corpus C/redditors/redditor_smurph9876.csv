cvwrpn3,0,t1_cvwplem,smurph9876,"For all his talk about favoring Europe heavily, Juergen hasn't shown any hesitation to rely heavily on MLS players. His call ups can get absurd for other reasons, but Beckerman, Besler, Gonzo, Evans, Zusi etc. have all been regulars under him. He pulls plenty from MLS.",22,0,1444642797,1444725425
cvvvmoc,0,t1_cvvvbv5,smurph9876,"We're clearly underachieving. It'd be one thing I'd we reached the GC final and lost to Mexico twice in a row. It's another when we can't handle Jamaica and Panama in the GC, and all the while are clearly playing below our talent level. This is the exact type of run that got Bradley fired, and Klinnsman needs to at least be in the hot seat right now. ",0,0,1444578796,1444725425

cvvpmta,0,t1_cvvnjvz,smurph9876,"Watch the 2009 Confederations or the 02 World Cup for inspired play under the previous 2 coaches. Juergen has definitely had his moments, and met (not exceeded) expectations at the World Cup. And he literally has accomplished nothing that the previous 2 coaches hadn't already accomplished. And save a few friendly results, we've looked lost since the World Cup. Tactics that don't benefit the team, uninspired play, bizarre personnel choices. Sure, the players take some blame, but if he's lost the team's respect then it's time for him to go. ",14,0,1444562417,1444725425
