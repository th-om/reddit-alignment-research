Religions do not make contradictory claims. We have God, We have a Religion that sets the rules on how to pray to God, we have set ideas on Good and Bad behavior, and we have a place to go when we die. Everything is virtually same. 


>""Jesus of Nazareth was resurrected in the first century"" necessarily include the statement ""Gabriel spoke to Muhammad in 610?""

Because they are both unsubstantiated claims.We have never seen or have documented proof of people being resurrected. We have never seen or have documented proof of Angels or angels speaking with anyone Muhammad included. 

Reason says one thing: Treat everyone as you expect to be treated. (Golden Rule) No dogma, no Quran, no Torah, no resurrection, no talking with angels, and no arguments. You have a right to practice a faith, I have a right not to, and not to be coerced to follow one directly or indirectly. 

**You know what epiphany for me at least.**

Would you support me (not financially) to not be Christian? Would you support the Idea that I have a ""Right"" not to practice any religion?

Lets cut to the to chase. 

The Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, the Sumerian god Anu, and the Japanese god Aji-Suki-Taka-Hi-Kone, or any other religion or gods that have ever existed, where they existed, are just as real as any God that exists today. 

*Its really that simply either all religions are true or none of them are.* This isn't trolling by any measure. 

Culture is a product of man. The arts, crafts, cuisine, language, and **religion** are subsets of culture. If you think other cultures past and present are not real, true, factual, whatever, then you're religion or religious claims are  just as false. 

Do I think in 610 archangel Gabriel spoke with Muhammad? No. Do you think 1844 Ellen White (Co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist) received visions by god? No. Do I think Joseph Smith in 1823 seer stones translated the ""Book of Mormon""? No. Benny Hinn, Joel Olsteen, Creflo dollar, Todd Bentley, Bob Larson, Joyce Myers, Dominion Theory, Calvinism, LDS, Jehovah Witness, Rick Joyner, and Prosperity theology?

I thought you wanted to know what influenced first century Jewish beliefs and expectations about a coming Messiah. If you are, rather, asking about how modern Christian denominations understand history in general, then I readily agree that there are various and sundry view; some people have come up pretty wacky views of how history works.

It has nothing do with how Christian denominations understand history. My example of the Jehovah Witness on how they misinterpret scripture in reading Daniel and Revelations based on their passed failed predictions.  This goes in line with the Hebrews mistaking Judas Maccabeus, Simon of Peraea, Athronges, and finally Jesus as the messiah, they like the Jehovah Wittiness were wrong. Judaism in the 1st century held no more importance as Israel itself other than its geographical location which was more important for the Romans to control. 

>Wait, what? Since when is everyone agreeing on something the criterion for historical accuracy. There a lot of people who think that the moon landing never happened. Does that mean that it is not historically true?

Christianity is no more true than the Greek and Roman religions given the division between Christians, which one is true?  In addition like your example of skepticism of the lunar landings there is  virtually no **history** of a Jesus especially of one who rose from the dead, this isn't even theology but more so mythology. 

>So your assumption is that if God chooses a people, then that people will make contributions in the fields you mentioned to a greater extent than those nations which are not chosen by God? Is that correct? If it is, could you provide the reasoning that lead you to that conclusion? It is not clear to me why that should be the case.

If gods exist then yes, and if the culture is successful then clearly their god is making it so. Western culture is defined by the Greeks and Roman achievements, not the Hebrews. As the example of democracy were we can elect our leadership these important ideas do not exist in the bible, but its product of Greek ideals, which is an important component of western culture.   Philosophy venerated by Christians scholars and theologians wasn't developed by the Hebrews, but by pagan Greeks hundreds of years before Jesus. Even the Catholic Church which was  is a institution of Roman civilization, not the Hebrews. This of course is barley scratching the surface of the legacy of the Romans and Greeks on Western Culture and what is the legacy of Hebrews? 

>If you think the Hebrew god existed or the Christian god, Jesus, angels and Satan are real, so were the Greek and Roman Gods.

**Explain the logic underlying this conclusion.**

Because all religions are mythology, by the lack of evidence of gods or supernatural creatures. Its special pleading to say my religion is factual but past cultures are not. I don't think an angel spoke with  Muhammad and I don't think Jesus is god, nor do I think gods exist period, basing it upon my lack and others  physical proof of gods,  but also the sheer number of gods that have been believed in the past, and the number of gods that people believe exist today. **Either all gods are real or none of them are.**

cvw29tp,0,t1_cvtptme,speaktodragons,">It is very interesting that a relatively minor part of the world at a fairly insignificant point in history still has relevance today. It's almost like there was some sort of divine intervention that preserved this teaching ;) . The influence of a government or even a person can't really be used to gauge God's favor. For instance, Israel held a rather large territory for a while and then was conquered, Rome was just the same. Yet millions revere the God of the Israelites and all but ignore the pantheon of Rome. 


Jerusalem was a back water of the Roman Empire. It held geographical importance, but nothing more. Rome, Athens, and Alexandra were far more important than Jerusalem during the 1st century. Israel held a rather large territory? When, what territory? It was nothing compered to the Greeks and Romans, especially the Romans who controlled the entire Mediterranean, parts of Europe and Great Briton. Israel holds no importance other than geographically and theologically, there are other reasons, but I would be heading towards towards politics, which would be out of context. 

**Millions did not revere the god of Israelite** and ignored every other religions practiced by either by the Romans or by states under controlled by Rome, where did you get this from? 


>If you believe Jesus was nothing more than a man, either he meant within his lifetime or he was a lunatic. However, if he is who he says he is, there is no reason to think he didn't mean he will return at some point in the future not bound to our whims.

Jesus did not write anything. Is this incorrect?  Everything Jesus supposedly said was not even written by actual witnessâ€™s, but those decades 30-70 years after the fact. It goes to the heart of the matter since Jesus did not write anything, because there is no need to write down his own gospel, since there would be no future to read it, that is if in fact he actually did say *he would return*  as his writers claim he would. What if my chance Jesus wasn't religious figure at all, but a political figure? The very fact he was crucified was because of treason to the Roman Empire. 

>The fact that an omniscient eternal God pays any attention to an organism that is a mere blip on the eternal radar is amazing in and of itself. What is man to question his creator? Consider how irritating it is when your computer demands that you perform some action on its timetable instead of your own. 

This isn't fact but an opinion. We live on a planet with many cultures historically and in the present. These cultures developed their own unique religions and gods. Your religion is no more real or less real than the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl. 

**What is man to question his creator?** Everything! We as humans question everything, we even  question why we question things. Questioning our parents, our families, our community, our religion,  and our gods this is in our DNA, if anything god wanted us to do this, its our birthright. The very fact you are a Reformed Baptist you should respect that one should question their superiors, what if Martin Luther did not question the authority of the Catholic Church? 

*And your computer analogy totally doesn't work.* Its like a man yells at his tools for breaking when he doesn't take care of them. 

*Are you not being somewhat complacent in your practice to simply accept this is the best answer of why Jesus had not returned? I don't know what denomination you belong to but in but considering how many different denominations exist and the various of Christians movements through the centuries, isn't God leaving his narrative up to us?* 

>What are a few centuries when compared to eternity? In eternal terms, Jesus ascended to heaven a little before breakfast this morning. 

You didn't answer the question. 

*Example: one of our coworkers has been removed. No response of why from our boss, the others coworkers start gossiping a reason. No one approaches our boss to find out why, i asked why, because if he was let go, are some of us doing the same thing as him, without us knowing? The answer is no.*

>Are you owed a reason? Is the man who hired you at his will unjust by terminating you at will? 

We are not talking politics or business, but religion You didn't get the connection. The idea that an employee is off the schedule. The same as Jesus is crucified. We have an event, the circumstances are not clear, we are forced to create a narrative, the narrative is not true, because we don't have all the facts. Its pretty clear that because Jesus did not write anything this return was in his life time and not some unknown future event. 

**Side note:** Yes, as employees, family members, parents, Americans citizen's we are owed a reason of why we are terminated. 

 >On the contrary, these false teachers are playing right in to God's hands. You may recall we were warned that false teachers would rise up and that we need to educate ourselves about who God really is to avoid them.

cvuh4ke,0,t1_cvtlbil,speaktodragons,"> The historical facts that I gave you are not dependent on any Christian denomination. First century Jews were expecting a messiah, and this expectation was based on calculations using the book of Daniel. This is historically true.

Have you ever talked to a Jehovah Witness? The book of Daniel and Revelations was not understood or meant to be understood  by the actual writers of the day  (200BC Daniel and 100AD Revelations) [but for Christians living in the US during the middle of the 19th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taze_Russell#Theology_and_teachings). I understand this is one example, but how many examples would I need to prove that Christians look at the bible differently than you and come to their own conclusions? So its not historical true nor its theological true either. 

First century Jews were not the only ones looking for an Messiah, there were three [Messiahs prior to Jesus.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah_claimants#Before_the_Common_Era) 

>First, that is not entirely true. Greece and Rome did make significant contributions to what we know as Western civilization, but even a cursory glance at the history of Europe will show that the Church was as significant as either of these and probably more so. The Church is a product of Christianity which is a branch of Judaism. In fact, if Christianity is true, then it is Judaism. We just use a different name to avoid confusion. It would be difficult to construe the religion of nearly 1/3 of the world as insignificant.
 
There is a lot here to unpack, seriously. I wish I had better writing skills to  describe the importance of Greek philosophy not just during the time of Plato but of our time as well. The very fact the Hebrews never developed anything resembling Greek concepts of government, philosophy, science, technology, engineering, navel, astronomy, and the development and practice democracy, how can anyone really say the Hebrews were the *chosen people* of god in light of the contributions of Greek civilization? 

The Roman Empire adopted adopted Christianity not the other way around. Roman Catholicism is last existing institution of the Roman Empire. 

>[Gratian also published an edict that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of Rome and Alexandria \(i.e., the Nicene faith\). The move was mainly thrust at the various beliefs that had arisen out of Arianism, but smaller dissident sects, such as the Macedonians, were also prohibited.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratian#Empire_and_Orthodox_Christianity)

Basically Emperor Gratian in 382 forced converted every subject to Christianity and dismantled the exiting pagan faiths by a decree. 

I don't know what you mean by Christianity is true? Which Christians, when, where, its not like all Christians think the same, in every region, in every time period. 

>Second, why on earth do you think that the historical importance of a civilization is based on their pagan mythologies being true? Are you actually suggesting that the Greek and Roman gods exist?

Yes, do you think a Greeks or Romans had less devotion to their gods then you? Just because no one practices the faith of the Romans or Greeks doesn't deny their importance or believably. If you think the Hebrew god existed or the Christian god, Jesus, angels and Satan are real, so were the Greek and Roman Gods.
