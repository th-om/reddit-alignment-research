Had a LS mate going through bringing people through for lvl 50+ quests at lvl 18-30. God I loved that game.",1,1,1444681738,1444722080
cvxavkq,0,t1_cvx57gu,itsmuddy,Looks like ESPN has the game notes on their site back to 2003. They have the records for 2002 but they don't seem to have any of the box score data.,2,0,1444680720,1444722080
cvxatbl,0,t1_cvx7i3k,itsmuddy,"It actually looks like the date you put is actually the correct one.

I checked all the Stl @ Cubs games in June and July for those two years and that was the only one that noted a rain delay.

Did you just guess at that date?",5,0,1444680632,1444722080

I think they just see that he does it without any feeling. I think Morgan is seeing a lot of what brought him to his crazy state going on with Rick right now and doesn't like where it will lead him.",10,0,1444672442,1444722080
