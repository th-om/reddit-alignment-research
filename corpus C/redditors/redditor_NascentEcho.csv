This is just obviously not true. A condensed NFL game that only shows the plays and skips everything else is about 50-60 minutes. ",0,0,1444641304,1444721179

cvw2nc1,0,t1_cvw2hsk,NascentEcho,"Both teams scored on opening drives.

Seahawks got a red zone interception which was returned for 70 yards but called back to the 20 due to the dirtiest play of the year by Michael Bennett, who blocked Dalton from behind and then tackled him when he was already on the ground. Hawks drove it to the 8 yard line but with 2 seconds left in they went for the field goal.

Seahawks O-Line has been actually good. Rawls got a 70ish yard touchdown run followed less than 2 minutes later by a fumble recovered for a touchdown by Wagner.

Bengals ST has been on point, two punts within the 5 yard line.
