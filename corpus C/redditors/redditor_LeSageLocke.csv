cvxp08h,1,t3_3ogo4x,LeSageLocke,"I'm assuming this will be your initial interview. 

I think the main thing is being comfortable talking about the technologies you know well, and being able to effectively describe past projects, your roles in those projects, what you learned from them, and things like that.  It's definitely good to know about agile programming methodologies (scrum, etc).

Also, personality is an important part of the internship. That doesn't mean you need to be an extrovert by any means, but your interviewer will be looking to have a good conversation with you. So, if there's some part about your studies or projects you've done that you're passionate about, let it show. 

And it's a good idea to think of good questions for your interviewer. What do like about IBM? What don't you like about it? Things like that, but try to be more original lol. 

Anyway, good luck.",1,0,1444702530,1444731576

cvxof5l,0,t1_cvx6hyy,LeSageLocke,Former EB intern here. The questions from an individual interview shouldn't be considered representative of the whole program as the actual technical interviews are specific to a particular project and the sponsors/mentors for that project.,1,0,1444701592,1444731576

cv7hxk2,0,t1_cv7h1vt,LeSageLocke,"> He doesn't realize that it's cheaper and easier for me to just throw together a Simulink diagram and write it to an FPGA chip than it is to do my own IC design.

Honestly, I think he *does* realize that. He's just seems bitter about it. I see the same sort of reaction from old software guys who are angry that JSON and REST APIs are supplanting XML and SOAP all over the place. XML/SOAP will never completely go away (even 40-year-old COBOL is still being maintained FFS), but they'll never be as common as they used to be. They're just too rigid and difficult to work with in most cases.

I'm guessing that's pretty much analogous to what this guy's upset about. ",3,0,1442713836,1444731576
cv7he12,0,t1_cv7gtgr,LeSageLocke,"> What I dont like is the arrogance I see from people who instead of admiting they do not know how to do X and have no desire to learn make it so that their ignorance is a badge of shame.

I honestly can't relate to this. If they don't know how to do X and they have no interest in learning how to do X, then they probably don't *need* to know how to do X, or they're going to lose their job. 

> Dont brag about ignorance. I know I dont know anything about say cement. I dont brag that is beneath my dignity to know. I simple state that I do not.

You're saying you don't like it when people act like their superior because their position/field is considered more glamorous than yours. I totally get that. There are people who have attitudes like that, and who genuinely believe that they're better than other people because their job gets more attention. And that's shitty.

But no one here did that. You suddenly got all pious when /u/DStoo basically said that, even though you weren't taught how to solder in college, you shouldn't feel like your education was lacking. He *did* say that it's a skill more commonly associated with EETs (I'm assuming this means electrical technicians, I'm a software engineer so I don't know). But he never said that being an EET is something to be ashamed of. You're the one acting like this is an insult.",4,0,1442712718,1444731576
