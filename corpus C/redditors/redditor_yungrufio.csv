cqrj8kw,0,t1_cqrbkn1,yungrufio,"I'm sorry but your response makes zero sense to me.  Germany is a federalist state, which means the central government rules over state/local legislation (like the federal government in the US).  In fact even more so than the US, with higher taxes, stronger regulations on living/working standards, healthcare education etc.  So i guess i'm missing how you think federalist would lead to feudalist?  My praise of a strong central government is my praise of my federal government.",1,0,1430235951,1444729581

This system would look like feudalism or an Agrarian society; both sound awful in comparison to living in the world's only hegemon.  I'll take my large centralized government and the modern day luxuries its strength provides me, thank you.  And In response to your overly simplified question maul this quote over.

""If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.""- James Madison; Federalist 51.",1,0,1430193191,1444729581
