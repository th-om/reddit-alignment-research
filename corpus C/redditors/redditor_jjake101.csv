The amount they get paid vs the amount of responsibility they have is completely out of balance.

Zookeeping is definitely 'a broke but loving it' profession.

If there was a chance to actually earn a decent salary that you could actually live on, id totally go for it.

I've heard competition for jobs in this field is incredibly fierce. If you have a job, they'll be a line of a 1000+ other people all willing to do it for a lower salary than what your on.

The entire episode was literally a holodeck recreation of the real event. So... why not have the episode based around the real event that was in the ST:ENT timeframe...?",1,0,1444569200,1444729667
