If social security is so great, why does the government abuse it? Why do they continue to steal from the imaginary ""lock box"" that should be truly separate from those other fund cites he refers to in the video?",8,0,1444690033,1444722431
cvurco4,0,t1_cvudaji,Oldschool1964,"Start off small. You most likely know your height. Most people could visualize how long something is by thinking about laying next to the object. Think about whether it is 1x, 1.5x, or 2x your height. That will get you to 10 - 12 ft depending on your height. From there, it gets a little harder, but then start thinking about a track and a single lap being 1/4 mile. If you straighten out a track, you can kind of estimate how far things are away from you. 

If you're measuring height, most stories of a house or building are approx 10 feet. You can use this as just a guesstimate when looking at tall things and compare them to the height of your house or the height of your ceiling in your house. Most ceiling heights are 8-9 feet (some older houses or basements might have lower ceilings). 

If you measure something and know the true height or length of an object, then start visualizing and comparing your known measurement to your unknown measurement, and you can usually get pretty close +/- 10% or so. ",1,0,1444485046,1444722431
cvtolzr,1,t3_3o0efg,Oldschool1964,"Can somebody explain how the government simply ""asks"" Hillary for her work-related emails in her personal account, and Hillary and her team get to make that determination? I would almost think that the Republicans were just setting her up for failure, as they knew she wouldn't hand over everything, and then could drop the hammer and slap her with obstruction.

What should have happened is that the government should have gone in and seized the servers and made the determination themselves (kind of like what's happening now). Why didn't that happen in the first place?",1,0,1444399379,1444722431

cvsi0xv,0,t1_cvshlbn,Oldschool1964,"Put yourself back in the 17th century where the idea of natural rights started to be established. At the time, a king was running roughshod over his kingdom. He was the one anointed by God, and some countries to this day still believe their supreme leader IS a God. He had ultimate authority over the people in his country, and he had the right to abuse them as he saw fit.

Along came these people like John Locke who saw this and thought about whether this agreed with or was in contrast with his belief in God. Are there fundamental rights that are given by God that not even the King/Emperor can take away? These fundamental rights were the ones he described and fought for. 

Nobody is saying these rights were part of the 10 commandments or anything. They were rights that our fellow man decided were so sacred to humanity that not even our rulers could take them away from the people. If you want to call them a UN Human Rights bill, so be it. Of course these rights are protected by man, but the fundamental difference is that according to our founders, those rights are not given to us by government. They are not government's to give. Life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness (which was the right to property) were all things that were untouchable according to these men. Many took a long boat ride, risking their lives to break away from what they viewed as tyranny, and fought a revolutionary war to establish these rights that these people believed in so much. They risked their lives in order to guarantee their children would have these rights that were not guaranteed back home.",10,0,1444314854,1444722431
cvshbq4,0,t1_cvsh12y,Oldschool1964,"And this is the liberal argument. But remember, a government that grants rights has the ability to take them away. 

The founders knew that, and were very deliberate to outline that the government is the protector of these rights that were bestowed upon us by our creator. All of the founders believed in a higher power (yes, some were deists), and they believed that man/government does not have the right to take away those rights that were rightfully theirs. The atheistic view of this has to be reconciled, as then the granter of these rights is not recognized, and thus, the ability of a government to impose tyranny on its people is unchecked.

These issues were what our founders debated at the time. This is not a new topic nor a new argument. They believed so strongly in this principle that they codified it in our founding document. ",10,0,1444313702,1444722431

Unalienable mainly appears in quotes of or references to the Declaration. Inalienable prevails everywhere else.""
