I guess that's the part I don't understand.  How would survivability not be related to truth?  If I have accurate beliefs about what food is and where to find it, then I think I'd survive quite a bit better than someone with inaccurate beliefs or no beliefs who was just wondering around sticking random things into his mouth.",15,0,1444581657,1444718314

Sigh, I don't even disagree with you on *all* of these issues, but if you honestly think that you've correctly identified your opponents underlying motivation, then you're just wrong.  Most people don't self identify themselves as the villain.  If someone is against legalizing drugs (to pick an example of an issue where we agree), it probably isn't because they are just really into ""ruining"" people's lives.  It's probably because they believe drugs cause societal harm and want to prevent it through the disincentives of prison sentences.  You can disagree that drugs cause societal harm or argue that the harm done by imprisoning people is worse, but to not even acknowledge that that's their underlying motivation and ascribe it to a desire to ""ruin"" people's lives, just means you're factually incorrect about their motivations.

Also, your point doesn't even logically follow... you say people don't support Sanders because they don't agree with issues A, B and C that Sanders supports.  Of course A, B, and C aren't exhaustive.  It'd be like saying... *you don't support Donald Trump because you don't agree with Trump's position that we should try to ""make America great.""  You don't want America to be great, so that's the reason you don't support Trump.*  If you can see why that argument's wrong, then by symmetry you should be able to see why you're original comment is being downvoted.",2,0,1443890744,1444718314

A better hypothesis is that the people who came up with these stats and formulas just really liked things that are valuable, and maybe making lots of 3 pointers turns out to be more valuable than human intuition or the ""eye test"" previously thought...",8,0,1443834412,1444718314
