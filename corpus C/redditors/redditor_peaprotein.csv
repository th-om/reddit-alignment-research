cvmigmv,1,t3_3n9yjz,peaprotein,"There is a REASON the founding fathers enumerated the Bill of Rights.  If they hadn't explicitly written out these natural human rights, somebody with influence would have convinced the populace against many of these natural rights decades ago.

We have seen several examples this year alone where society has disintegrated into chaos.

Nothing is certain in life, and never will be.  If you don't think our government is capable of violating human rights, just look at the human rights violations own our CIA and FBI has committed this past century against foreign entities.

If they can torture non-US citizens as an enemy of the state, they sure as hell wouldn't think twice about doing to their own if they deemed you as a domestic enemy of the state.

You need to start thinking of yourself as a sovereign individual with sovereign thought processes.  Being able to protect yourself and your family from any present and unknown future threat is something that is natural to all forms of life here on earth.",1,0,1443849510,1444720285
