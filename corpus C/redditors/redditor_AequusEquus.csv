cvx3nkm,1,t3_3oe01s,AequusEquus,"It's because the environment is so heavily impacted by the petroleum/oil industries. These industries in particular are so incredibly huge, with huge markets (more than just automobiles), huge employee bases, and huge pocketbooks (which results in heavy political influences). The bottom line is that money talks. Some of the biggest deniers are funded by money that comes from big players in this industry. Think about how sloppy the transition to clean energy would be if efforts aren't made to specifically combat the issues arising from it: millions of people losing their jobs, market instability, deflation and/or inflation, etc. People don't like change, especially when it's difficult. It's easier to just remain steadfast in your habits and deny there's anything wrong.",3,0,1444670321,1444727880

cvvrjgu,1,t3_3o9n98,AequusEquus,"When I took British Literature with Bruster, they set up the tests such that one portion of the exam required you to know which stories certain excerpts came from. Now I don't know if you've ever read through such wonders as Shakespeare's sonnets or John Donne, or Alexander Pope, but after a while they all run together. And they all have similar titles too - really bland names like ""Canto 1."" So these excerpt questions were damn near impossible for me. They weren't easy quotes, and basically none of them mentioned character names (easy identifier) and I probably only got like one exerpt correct per test. Maybe I'm just a whiney little bitch,  but I thought that was unreasonable and an utterly useless/pointless thing to require students to remember.",4,0,1444569241,1444727880
