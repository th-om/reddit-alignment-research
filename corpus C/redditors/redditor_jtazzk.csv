Not everyone can be in a high position, even if everyone worked equally hard for it and was equally talented, because some people have to do the actual work (e.g production). In this situation, the majority of people works below someone and earn a lot less than him accordingly, even if they worked as hard and were as talented as their bosses. In that society, there would like in ours be a infinite amount of money, but it would be distributed in an unfair way. Therefore, people would stay in their positions and wouldn't be able to change that, which shows that all of it is in theory not a zero sum game, but in reality, it is, as people are forced to value their skills and time less than the little amount of money they get, which again shows that, in theory, both parties gain from this voluntary exchange but in reality, one party is forced to do this exchange (you have to earn money to survive).
