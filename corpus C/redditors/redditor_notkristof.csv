I'm glad you see that jail time is not a solution ( or at least a productive one)

>You can't really be arrested for drug problems unless you actually have it on you. So I don't see how that's an issue.

This *is* an issue because drug users frequently do have it in possession in their residence. A common problem that has killed people I personally know is that users will not call medical professionals in the case of overdose because the dying person or others are afraid of punitive measures.. 

>That's a general problem with criminality in general, not something specific to this issue. It's simply something that has to be addressed also.

I agree that this is also pervasive issue with all criminality. However, decriminalizing use will have an positive impact on the specific issue of drug use and reduce harm to users and therefore the population at large. Criminalizing users for the ""victim-less crime"" of self harm only serves to promote further harm to the user. 

>People are making the mistake that I think they should be ostracized and thrown in jail.

This is the primary tool the state has to deal with criminals who break the law. If this is how you feel about the situation, perhaps you should rethink your position or the criminality of use. One can advocate mandatory treatment and the removal of charges from on offender's criminal record, but what happens when the user refuses  the prescribed treatment of the state? The power of the state to enforce any law stems from it's ability to harm and incarcerate the individual. Do you think it is appropriate to employ these tactics when the user has harmed no one but themselves? ",1,0,1444705302,1444724194
cvx8sow,1,t3_3oeen0,notkristof,"Lets focus on a subset of your claims and ignore the topic of personal freedom and autonomy for the time being.

You say that drugs, in general, are harmful and this appears to be your primary motivation for keeping them illegal. Supposing I agree with your on this point, there are still several reasons the legalize them.While drugs may be harmful, it is even more harmful to the users physical well-being and quality of life to criminalize their actions. 

1) Criminalizing the use of drugs funnels users into the criminal justice system, reducing their quality of life, and propagates the conditions of poverty which often led them to use in the first place.

2) Criminalizing drug use presents legal and social barriers to the rehabilitation and treatment of their addiction. Users are hesitant to come forward in medical crisis for treatment for fear of incarceration. Same for those who seek treatment. 

3) Labeling users as criminals servers to alienate them in the minds of the public, reducing empathy, interest, and aid. 

Given that individuals will be harmed on way or another, can you claim that they are harmed less under the current model?",1,0,1444677750,1444724194

>What I want to know is what you would considering doing in defiance of my kind of attitudes.

The answer is pretty obvious. Try to elect a majority and pass legislation to enforce their views.  

This is the same thing you are trying to do. ",1,0,1443227591,1444724194
