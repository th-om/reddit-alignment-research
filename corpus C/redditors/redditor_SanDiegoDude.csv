cvxud5k,0,t1_cvxsixr,SanDiegoDude,"You mean by throwing flags every play? That's on sloppy play, not the refs.",1,0,1444712130,1444719515
cvxubrb,0,t1_cvxs6fh,SanDiegoDude,"Something is wrong with him. Is he playing hurt? He looked Derek Cox bad today... While Verrett played fucking lights out.

edit - Also, props to Te'o. Looks like he fixed his tackling problems this week, he was making plays left and right. ",1,0,1444712041,1444719515
cvxuaaa,0,t1_cvxs7au,SanDiegoDude,"/sigh

The sad part is, once the Chargers are firmly on the cusp of not making it to the playoffs, they're going to take off, then fuck it all up in the last game of the season, going 9/7 or 8/8, just bad enough to be yet another worthless season, but just good enough to push beyond the truly elite draft picks.

cvxu6u3,0,t1_cvxsw7q,SanDiegoDude,"Remember Broncos game late last season? Fucking Denver-ites were buying season tickets for 600+ bucks a pop, Charger ticket holders sold out for a merrier xmas. Fucking stadium was solid orange. /puke.",3,0,1444711728,1444719515
cvxu4f9,0,t1_cvxs0wl,SanDiegoDude,"Frank Reich is very happy with his runs up the middle for 1 yard on first down EVERY FUCKING TIME thank you very much. &#3232;_&#3232;

Nope, not bitter at all. ^^^FIRE ^^^^HIS ^^^^^ASS! ",1,0,1444711575,1444719515
cvxtmaz,0,t1_cvxt7b7,SanDiegoDude,"Wouldn't blame you if you had the sound turned down, but Gruden actually explained really well why Gordon isn't getting the big runs. Basically bad blocking, no Fullback, and no blocking TEs. He said if Gordon got a better supporting cast, he'd be amazing. ",14,0,1444710480,1444719515
cvxtkem,0,t1_cvxszo1,SanDiegoDude,"Oh, I'm sure we'll take 2 Linebackers and a WR for the next draft. Gotta keep the momentum going. At least it will be a high draft pick. We've had so much luck with UDFA linemen, why stop now? /s

cvxtf3l,0,t1_cvxs6cm,SanDiegoDude,"Sure he does, 1 yard up the gut is Reich's favorite running play to call.

Meh, I don't even care anymore. Hello apathy, my old... Acquaintance. ",1,0,1444710074,1444719515
cvxtdgi,0,t1_cvxs5up,SanDiegoDude,"Ehhh, on the flip side, Addae prevented a TD with that hit. Was kinda a no win situation honestly. ",2,0,1444709978,1444719515
