I think the developer agreed to touch-up the aesthetic a little bit, so it won't look as bad as the Candlewood Suites downtown, but still idk why they aren't attaching balconies on the second floor. They are literally ON the parade route.",3,0,1444673014,1444721333

cvrf12f,0,t1_cvr87k2,jamesbondindrno,"I think that they do care about popular opinion, especially Manzie. This is sort of a specifically divisive issue. The people who live on that part of Dauphin really don't want another bar/venue there (the Music Box was contentious for residents), and to be fair it is out of the entertainment district. 

From what I understand, they would already have approval for the venue if they didn't want the occupancy so high. They started out asking for a thousand, now they want 850, but the building isn't really huge. Well maybe it is. Actually this is just leftover Music Box drama. Same people involved, same politics. 

All that said, I support the venue.",2,0,1444235416,1444721333
