cvrk2pp,0,t1_cvrim5w,HomelessPandas,"Well for starters, I never argued that the document ""advocated"" for slavery. Advocating for a thing is *very* different than condoning it. So putting words in my mouth undermines *your* assertion.

Anyhow, let's take another look at the text;

*No person held to service or labour in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labour, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labour may be due*

Who the fuck else where they talking about when they said ""persons held to service or labor"" who were escaping forced labor? 

It sure wasn't poor white people. Maybe prisoners, but you have an incredibly difficult argument to make that the original intention of the clause was not centrally targeted at slaves. Are you really trying to argue that there people to whom their  ""service or labour may be due"", were not slave owners?


Yes, the document never once used the word ""slave"", and never explicitly mentioned slavery. The framers were intentionally vague with stuff like this, and yes, it has proved useful in cases concerning prisoners, but that does not negate the historical origins of the language. 

However, it's obvious that through the fugitive slave clause and the Fugitive Slave Act which forged a mechanism to exercise that clause, that slavery was condoned.

cvrivy2,0,t1_cvrig1t,HomelessPandas,"No, I really do comprehend the difference. 

See the thing is, my usage of the two adjectives does not apply to the same subject. This use of the two words upon the same subject, would of course be a paradox. However, as I tried to explain to you, my use of the word ""explicitly"" describes the nature of the implications in the Fugitive Slave Clause, which are obvious.


So again, substitute the word ""obviously"" for ""explicitly"" and you get this;

*it's obviously implicit that the Constitution condoned slavery""*




Just because something is implied does not mean it was hidden, in fact, something can still be implied while being quite obvious at the same time. That is what I expressed by using the phrase ""explicitly implicit"".

cvricmo,0,t1_cvrhnvm,HomelessPandas,"The connotation to slavery was no longer relevant, because ""person held to service or labor in a state"" could no longer be a slave. In practical terms, the 14th amendment neutered the clause, making it essentially irrelevant, because it's pretty obvious that slaves were originally it's primary target. 

I've read US v. Kosmicki, I'm well aware the clause still exists, and that prisoners can be defined as ""persons held to service or labor"".

>So are you saying our constitution still condones slavery since the clause remains intact and enforceable?

No.

It does however provide a profound reminder of the historical context in which the document was constructed.",1,0,1444238940,1444718654
cvqvz16,0,t1_cvqpg59,HomelessPandas,"Ah, the irony.


Explicit is the modifier to the word implicit, it denotes the nature of the subject word(implicit). I'll go ahead and give you the meaning, so you don't have to think too hard. Slavery, while not explicitly condoned by the constitution by a statement like;

""Owning a slave is the right of every American""

is quite obviously implicitly condoned by the fugitive slave clause. Why else would the clause exist if slavery was not condoned?  In fact, it's so obvious, that one might call it ""explicitly implicit"". 

The word obvious is a synonym for explicit, so substitute the word ""obviously"" for explicitly in my comment, then maybe then you can use your brain and actually add something valuable to the discussion instead of being a cunt.",1,0,1444186774,1444718654
cvp3zn0,0,t1_cvosjkq,HomelessPandas,"I'm well aware of the debate over the Commerce Clause, and I don't really know what the point of your monologue is. I've already cited several cases which wrangled with it in this post. Aside from the final sentence, you're just illustrating my point, it was assumed that nobody would engage in fearsome debate over section 2 of the 1st article. Those aren't the type of sections that inspire debate.

>So point out a particular constitutional provision, and we can discuss that term in particular.

Again, I didn't want to, that wasn't the point. I wasn't trying to debate an isolated piece. The post is intended to get a sense of how participants in this sub read the document, and that's exactly what has happened, people have shared the method of legal reasoning they prefer.

cvopokw,0,t1_cvoi2j6,HomelessPandas,"Here's how I see it.

Cruel = Malicious punishment with the intent to cause harm or trauma. 

Unusual= A punishment that is not typical for the context, and is not socially acceptable. (hanging or electric chair is now ""unusual"", and some argue that the death penalty in general is ""unusual"")

The problem you run into here is that technically, all punishment can be qualified as cruel, which is why I think that unusual is the more important word. So that's why I think it's better read as ""punishment that is both cruel and unusual"" because you could make a strong argument that jail is a ""cruel"" punishment.

Subjective law = bad law in your eyes

so

Vague law= 8th amendment

These statements I'm making are what you will hear in law school, or in a study of the constitution, which is the whole point of the post.
