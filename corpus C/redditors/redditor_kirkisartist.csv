cvxuvry,1,t3_3oijdb,kirkisartist,"It's hard to trust any idea that big until you hear the catch. She wasn't even interested in a kickstarter. So I'm cautiously optimistic.

I'm not sure if pubmed is a credible source or not. But here's a study on mice that sounds pretty successful http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22585399

The only catch is, we're not mice. So it's not guaranteed to work on humans.",1,1,1444713434,1444716926

cvx830y,1,t3_3ofij7,kirkisartist,"It's called the [""is-ought problem""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem). Libertarians are notorious for this fallacy. Charity aught to take care of the needy, but it doesn't. Businesses with unethical policies should go bankrupt, but they don't. Same can be said for statists. Government shouldn't be corrupt, but it is.

The cure for poverty and lazyness is efficiency. Then we can afford to be lazy and poor. If you automate farming (assuming there's fertile land to go around) and distribution, then food prices should drop to the raw value of demand. Once milk passes the sell by date, it has accumulated a negative value.

But the is-ought problem in regard to technology is tough. A small rural African village can afford phones because the infrastructure is simple and the barrier of entry is low. But a clean and abundant water source is a far, far more difficult and labor intensive engineering problem.

Ebola creates a technological problem. Deadly mosquitoes live in the fresh water supply. So villagers cannot live near it and irrigation will only attract mosquitoes to your faucet, but you can take your chances and fetch gallons of water from the distant water source. Fetching water half the day eliminates the possibility of holding a full time job. 

I highly recommend Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond.",1,0,1444676718,1444716926

We need to change our education system to adapt. School choice+project based learning seems to be the way to go.
