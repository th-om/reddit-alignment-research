No, aiding in the toppling of the democratic governments of Guatemala and Iran, supporting the dictatorial Batista regime of Cuba, and ramping up american involvement in Vietnam.

We can acknowledge him, but that doesn't mean we have to celebrate him.

> Suppressed history always gets repeated.

Nothing is being suppressed. Kids will still learn about him in school, they just won't have off on a day named after him.

> Many Americans don't know about his darker history, thus this is all the more reason NOT to further suppress him.

Once again, no suppression is occurring. If we want to shed more light on the dark things that came as a result of Columbus, perhaps we should change the holiday to Native American Day, in acknowledgment of the suffering of native peoples.

> Finally, the holiday is not ""for"" him. It's about celebrating his arrival America, which except for maybe the birth of Christianity, has effected the course human history more than any other event.

That holiday is about celebrating Italian heritage. Being of Italian heritage myself, I'd much prefer to have a day named after [Phillip Mazzei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Mazzei) or [Francis Vigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Vigo), both of whom lack the taint of genocide that Columbus brings.",1,1,1444704252,1444718610

While I wouldn't go as far to say that conservatives don't ""support"" democracy in theory, it seems to me there is an undervaluing and even outright hostility to the expansiveness that democratic values require. 

I've heard conservatives support voter ID laws, felony disenfranchisement, partisan gerrymandering (Yes, Democrats do it too, but I haven't heard any complaints or calls for reforms from the conservative side as I have from the liberals), hostility to the Voting Rights Act, and the Electoral College, all of which work to limit the franchise.
