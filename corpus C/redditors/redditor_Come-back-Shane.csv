cvo9b9b,0,t1_cvo95ng,Come-back-Shane,"I'm totally ignorant about these things, but you'd think it wouldn't take much work to make stock android work on a device that has hardware capable of running it.  Or am I way off base because of the software that the OS needs to communicate with the specific chips in each type of phone?",0,0,1443996266,1444731918
cvo5rm3,1,t3_3nh3ad,Come-back-Shane,"Why can't they just offer a stock android version of their phones, and then charge an extra $25 or so for it?",0,0,1443990866,1444731918
cvns58y,0,t1_cvnpzx5,Come-back-Shane,"I was in the same boat as you.  About a month ago, I bought a Lumia 640 from Microsoft for around $60 off contract.  While I haven't decided for sure to make the switch from Android, I will say that the user experience on the 640 is ridiculously awesome (especially considering it's mid-range hardware!).  The live tiles give me constant at-a-glance updates, and the OS is glassy-smooth.  I've been an Android user for years now, but if I could get the two or three apps I use (that aren't currently available on the platform) to sideload on Windows Mobile, I think I'd make the switch to the 950XL.",2,0,1443969433,1444731918
cvk996q,0,t1_cvk7gib,Come-back-Shane,"Well, it does say dropped at different angles.  I'm sure they could have been pretty selective about those angles though.",3,0,1443681005,1444731918
cvk2zyh,0,t1_cvk2xzt,Come-back-Shane,"I'd love to have a phone that wouldn't 'need' a case.  I agree that many people will put a case on it anyway, but it's fantastic to at least have the option not to.",10,0,1443666731,1444731918
cvk2sf8,1,t3_3n1sel,Come-back-Shane,"This sounds intriguing!   ""Independent testing and certification firm MET Laboratories tested the LG V10 by dropping it from height of 48 inches repeatedly at different angles and found it to be ""MIL-STD-810G Transit Drop Compliant"" for shock.""",32,0,1443666362,1444731918
cvjn0xr,1,t3_3mzktq,Come-back-Shane,"I just bought a Lumia 640 to play with until I decide on which flagship device to get.  Honestly, the OS is ridiculously fast and smooth, even on midrange hardware!   It's so good that it has me considering the 950XL, even though I've been using Android for years.  And the app availability isn't nearly as bad as I'd heard.  In fact, I was able to find all the apps I use regularly (either the original apps or really nice third party apps) except for Logitech Harmony and Amazon Music.  Even my bank has an app on windows phone now!  I'm waiting to see Microsoft's announcements next week before I make my final decision.",9,0,1443641203,1444731918
cvj0y1s,0,t1_cvj0gqy,Come-back-Shane,"Are you saying that the original developers of the apps need to be on board before this can happen?  Or do you mean that private devs need to take the time to make it happen?  I'm woefully ignorant of the process, so I apologize in advance for what's probably a stupid question.",1,0,1443593112,1444731918
cvixgv8,1,t3_3mwdng,Come-back-Shane,The main Android/iOS apps I'd really want to run would be the Logitech Harmony app and maybe the Amazon Music app.  Are those the sort of apps that could successfully run on Windows Mobile using those tools?,1,0,1443584738,1444731918
