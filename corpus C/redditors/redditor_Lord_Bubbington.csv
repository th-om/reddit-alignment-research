cvwsc23,0,t1_cvwqjpg,Lord_Bubbington,"I think Eisenhower could have. Nixon (he *probably* won the popular vote due to some weirdness in the Deep South) almost won in 1960, there was a 4 term president only 15 years earlier, and Eisenhower was more popular than Nixon. Also Clinton could have won if there was no Monica Lewinski scandal, but I don't think he would have run for a 3rd term if he was able too.",7,0,1444645645,1444719030

cvw6fpk,0,t1_cvw500q,Lord_Bubbington,"Yeah, back when I started taking lexapro, I felt *some* effects the first day, although large parts of that were probably due to me starting other forms of treatment that day as well. In my opinion, the long lasting effect and slow build up of lexapro makes many people underestimate how effective it actually is. Anti-depressants are ridiculously complicated, as is depression, which leads people to misunderstand it. Many people (in my experience) get into this mindset that either anti-depressants fix you completely or they don't work. Really frustrating.",2,0,1444596008,1444719030

cvw2up5,0,t1_cvw24jg,Lord_Bubbington,"Also worth adding, when you go off most anti-depressants your depression will creep in much faster than lexapro, because it stays in your system for a while (iirc). Same reason many people take a few weeks to feel the effects- it's not in your system yet.",2,0,1444590721,1444719030
cvvm29x,1,t3_3o8lb3,Lord_Bubbington,"How serious are her allergies? Because at least for food allergies, knowingly triggering a life-threatening allergy can be assault or attempted murder in some places. Not sure if that is the law of the land in Kentucky though.",5,0,1444546851,1444719030
cvvlqhs,0,t1_cvvlg9h,Lord_Bubbington,"So can I have my money back for the Iraq war then? How the money currently spent on prisons, or the death penalty? Also, no one is forcing you to do anything, that is the price for living where you live. There are plenty of places on the planet (I.E. Somalia) where the government has little to no influence.",2,0,1444545688,1444719030
