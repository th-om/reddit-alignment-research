However the majority of the time, from what I have seen as a member of the digital forensics community, there are little to no defensive measures taken.  I would be surprised if they were using a VPN.",2,0,1444579953,1444730372

And if the attacker is an proficient as /u/road_to_nowhere thinks they are, the police are extremely unlikely to be able to do anything anyway.",1,0,1444578788,1444730372

The caps are anti-competitive.  The likely largest uses for that data is other media services (Netflix, Prime, etc).  My capping the usage they are trying to make those services less appealing compared to their own packages.  In my opinion the caps are less about charging you and more about fighting dirty against Netflix.",1,0,1444050279,1444730372
