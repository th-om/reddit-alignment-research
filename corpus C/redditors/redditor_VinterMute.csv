Personally, I think it is ridiculous to judge politicians by members of their campaign. Hillary Clinton got started working for Barry Goldwater, after all. ",1,0,1444714495,1444716534

If he is starting to fail as a provider, she needs to pick up the slack. Turning her back the first time she needs to give more than she takes is selfish and not loving at all. 

You let people hit bottom *until they are ready for treatment*. He very well could be, and that is the avenue she would pursue if she has any humanity for the man who took care of her all this time. ",-15,0,1444712322,1444716534

How about she get a job and start paying him back by taking care of his expenses while he gets treatment?",-2,0,1444711962,1444716534
cvxtgdu,1,t3_3oiwst,VinterMute,">Rand Paul IS NOT SOCIALLY LIBERAL! That's such lazy fucking reporting. At least do half the job of a journalist and remember back in 2009 when Rand Paul had to fire staffer Chris Hightower for posting an old picture of a lynched black man with the phrase ""Happy Nigger Day!"" to social media on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

Oh my God, he fired a person for being racist! Only a racist would do that!",6,0,1444710146,1444716534

The state does not grant rights, only recognizes them and just because their are human lives which the state refuses to recognize the rights for out of convenience does not mean such rights do not exist. It just means that the force used to protect those rights will need to come externally than 'daddy government'. ",1,0,1444681293,1444716534
