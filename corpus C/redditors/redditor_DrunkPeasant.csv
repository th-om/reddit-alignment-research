Local police had a sting where they arrested many prostitutes. At the arraignment, the IRS agents were waiting to asses income taxes on their income that was not reported. They based their easement on life style, apartment, clothes and money in bank.",1,0,1444534872,1444718594

Stop treating women as children who can't decide what to do with their own damn body.

>If you can pay money to do whatever you want to a woman, then you are treating women as mere objects.

If that woman actually sold you that service of her own free will and is getting paid for it this objectification BS doesn't apply.

That's why many prostitutes these days get prrof that they are negative for STDs to show their clients. So that's not a valid reason....If they legalized it they could institute laws requiring both parties to get tested.

>concerns such as trafficking

They could regulate it and thake trafficking away, it would be just like any other job. You don't see apple trafficking indians to be software engineers...

>violence
There will always be violence no matter what

>potential moral objection

It's a persons choise to sell sex if they want to, it's their body and they should be able to choose whatever the hell they want to do with it. You don't see government telling what sexual positions are moral and which aren't....",3,0,1444504040,1444718594
