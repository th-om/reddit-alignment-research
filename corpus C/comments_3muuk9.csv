The part where that is anywhere near a good quantitative measure of freedom. You intentionally left off any benefit you receive as a result of taxpayer money and how it enhances your freedom.

It is not a centrist policy. Militarism is inherently invested in nationalism, imperialism, and often concepts of cultural superiority. These are right-wing things. Just because democrats have engaged in this doesn't mean it's a liberal policy.

The left is all-in on control regarding social issues, they just take a different attack on the issue by encoding ideas about them into law that we consider less restrictive in practice.  Neither side (outside of the libertarian right) is looking to lessen government influence on social issues, they just have different agendas to push the government's influence on them.

> But the U.S. isn't a fascist country and the way in which the left in the U.S. and post-WWII Europe promotes collectivist policies does not dovetail with a fascist agenda.

Hitler was an verbindungsmann for a Aufklärungskommando unit in the Reichswehr.

Stalin shifted the USSR to State Capitalism and called it Communism, and was allegedly waiting for Germany to have a Socialist revolution before shifting from Communism over to Socialism.

Instead, Hitler ended up breaking their alliance and invading.

It has a lot of the same elements that Communism has. Both Communism and Fascism believe in a one party state. Both reject the notion of the Free Market Capitalism. Both reject the notion of Freedom of the Press. Both reject Democracy. Both favor planned economies. Both favor authoritarian or totalitarian rule. Both glorify the State and its leaders. Both are militaristic in its goals to spread its form of Socialism internationally. Both use the State to counter opposing political theories and individual freedoms. Both advocate violent revolutions and murder of political enemies to advance its socialistic movements. Both believe that the individual is meaningless and all individuals must submit to the will of the Party and the State.  

The Differences are rather small really. In Communism all religion is abolished and the Communist Revolution is glorified as a replacement. In Fascism the state becomes the religion but traditional and cultural religions are tolerated. In Communism the state owns all industries and controls all aspects of the economy. In Fascism the state controls the economy but private ownership of industries are tolerated but directed by the State. In Communism all classes are eliminated although the Party replaced the ruling class and all ""counter-revolutionary"" organizations and individuals are suppressed, killed, or exiled. In Fascism class structure is maintained although class distinctions are eliminated (NSDAP was more race oriented than Italian and Spanish Fascism) and all opposition is suppressed, killed, or exhaled.  

When thinking of politics on this level don't think of a straight line. Think of a circle. On the top of the circle on the left side you have the Communist while on the right you have the Fascist.

The NSDAP was unambiguously part of the German Far-Right, alongside the DNVP. Their beliefs were hierarchical, anti-rationalist, anti-Enlightenment, pro-agrarianist (though they supported industrialisation for warfare purposes), anti-democratic, violently anti-socialist, and pro dominating Prussian state.

The confusion is partly because the Nazis weren't traditionalist-conservatives. They were socialists though, as were the revolutionary-conservatives (both Far Right). When they called themselves socialists, they were referring to Germanic social solidarity and consciousness. This is Spenglerian socialism, influenced by Plenge and Sombart.

Fascism, by definition:

- is anti-communist.

- is anti-capitalist.

- is anti-democratic.

- is hyper-nationalist.

- always features a cult of personality around some strong leader (Mussolini, Hitler, etc).

Neo-nazism tends to drop at least the anti-capitalist and cult of personality elements and focus on the racial/nationalist elements (which were always a key feature of Nazism but less important in other fascist states).

That is, I think there is a distinction between garden-variety ethnic nationalists wrapping themselves in the swastika for greater visibility/prestige/whatever and real Nazis. To be the latter, they'd have to advocate for the replacement of the current political and economic structures with a charismatic dictatorship. Instead, it seems most simply advocate excluding people they don't like from the existing structures.

One characteristic of (certain segments of) the German right-wing was a belief in a sort of Germanic romanticist, national-conservatism. At the more extreme end were the revolutionary conservatives and the populist, Volkisch movement (though I wouldn't say that the Volkisch movement was inherently right-wing). 

The association of Nazism with the left-wing comes from the libertarians, I believe. Basically, they retroactively apply their own modern, American conceptions of politics onto the German politics of the late 19th and early 20th century.
