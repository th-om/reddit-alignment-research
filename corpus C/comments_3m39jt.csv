While ""third parties"" are extremely unlikely to win, allowing them to run in the general is crucial to allowing the democrat and republican bases to shift. An example of this is the tea party leveraging its way into mainstream republicanism. ",12,0,1443029958,1444724950

I've often heard this from opponents of FPTP, but I don't get it.  Other countries have more than two main parties with FPTP voting.  I feel like tradition is a bigger factor than the way we vote.  We've simply grown accustomed to Republicans and Democrats being the only ""electable"" parties and that's that.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we changed to another voting method and the vast majority of elected officials were *still* R's and D's.",2,0,1443031135,1444724950

cvc1obd,0,t1_cvblhzz,CommodorePiri,"You've misunderstood the rule as has everyone that has responded to you so far. 

Duvergers law is M+1=Number of parties competing for a seat *in a district*, where M is the number of seats available in that district.

Other countries with FPP voting and multiple parties get that variation from regional differences but in each district there will be a trend towards two parties.

America has Presidential elections which gives you a nation-wide district with one seat available. This creates nation wide pressure towards 2 parties. 

In each of your districts you could have a third party or Independent competing against R or D but ultimately that third party will likely never be able to successfully compete for the presidential elections (without spoiling the voting).",6,0,1443056122,1444724950
cvbmgyu,1,t3_3m39jt,sillyhatday,"I like FPTP, but It works best if you only have two candidates. To produce two candidates, you need a jungle primary before it. This is basically what France does in a system they call ""two rounds."" A lot of municipal elections here work this way too. I think it would work really well for every election except president. Because of the EC and the giant party nominating process, it would be an additional layer of voting nobody would want.

Also, we could let people vote for multiple candidates on the ballot for an office. Lets say you're a libertarian and you'd like to vote for their nominee, but you know it's not going to happen so eat it and vote for the Republican who needs the votes in a close race vs the democrats. But if you could cast multiple votes, your ballot might look like

Democrat [   ]

Republican  [ x ]

Green [   ]

Libertarian [ x ]

Constitution  [   ]


To be clear, there is no vote ranking here, just selecting all candidates who are acceptable to you. Winners are still likely to receive majority support, but without being zero sum to smaller parties. Smaller parties can also build public support this way due to voter migrations and injecting issues into public debate. ",5,0,1443032543,1444724950

cvcks89,0,t1_cvbotp9,DoctorDrakin,"The biggest problem with IRV people in the US is that Americans really do crave simplicity. Even Burlington which gave IRV a shot quickly repealed it because they didn't understand/ like how the guy who could get the most 1st preference votes could lose or how a guy who was more accepted by everyone for being pretty centrist but was unpopular could lose to a more popular more partisan candidate.

I've always said if you are serious about IRV in the US you need to make it optional IRV. If you really want to go in an rank then go for it but there's no requirement to do so and you can just vote one as people always have. It makes it fair to the motivated people who vote for random third parties and independents to have a second choice and not worrying about throwing away the election. It also is a smooth and simple transition that allows the vast majority to vote as they always have. Then if one day and independent comes along people like there will at least be a way to actually push to get them elected instead of worrying about hurting your side and maybe then the rest of America will catch on.

In my mind, keeping our election results comprehensible for all voters is key to maintaining the sanctity of our democracy.

The downside for the President is that the country is so large, that staggered primaries provide an opportunity for smaller, unknown candidates to gain support buy being able to concentrate in fewer States early on. Sanders would have a lot more problems with this system than with the current system because he'd find it difficult to raise enough funds to wage an effective national campaign. Same with Obama in 2008. Essentially, only candidates with enough national recognition way before the election would have a chance.
