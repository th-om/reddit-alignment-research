This was all pre-civil war, of course. Shit changes.

--------------------

5. Why doesn’t the ACLU support gun ownership/gun control?

The Second Amendment provides: “A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” The ACLU of Arizona policy on the individual right to bear arms is different from our National ACLU policy on the issue. The National ACLU, based in New York, believes that the Second Amendment protects a collective right rather than an individual right. The National ACLU Policy #47 supports the Supreme Court’s 1939 decision in United States v. Miller, which endorsed the view that the Second Amendment does not confer an unlimited right upon individuals to own guns or other weapons, nor does it prohibit reasonable regulation of gun ownership, such as licensing and registration. The ACLU of Arizona, which is based in Phoenix, supports the individual right to bear arms – a right that is expressly identified in Article 2, Section 26 of the Arizona Constitution. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court in D.C. v. Heller held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, whether or not associated with a state militia. In July 2008, the ACLU of Arizona Board of Directors passed the following policy: “Resolved that ACLU of Arizona does not follow national board policy #47 that the right to bear arms is a collective, not an individual right. The Arizona Constitution expressly provides that the right to bear arms, to the extent constitutionally protected, is an individual right, so policy #47 has never been operative in Arizona.”",8,0,1441692647,1444731842
cuttf4j,1,t3_3k0g8w,macamacamac,Isn't the fact that it has been clearly accepted for over 200 years as meaning an individual right trump any kind of theory of what you could possibly interpret the words to mean otherwise. Like you can't actually honestly argue that's what the written words were intended to mean. At best you can claim that's what you want them to mean.

cutsuwx,1,t3_3k0g8w,Shotgun_Sentinel,"The ACLU mistakenly thinks that the miller decision and all of the other smaller decisions that quote that decision make it a collective rights. 

The fact is the way it is written, the way the Founders intended for it to be interpreted, and the way the Miller decision is even written says that it is not a collective right. All of the other amendments have ""the people"" in them and that is always construed to mean they are individual rights.

Also remember that the ACLU is a very liberal organization, and their own biases effect the way they see things.",12,0,1441661816,1444731846
