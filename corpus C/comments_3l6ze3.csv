And, of course, because the study was conducted by a left-wing group, Citizen's for Tax Justice, it does exactly that.

In actuality, the top 1% receives a projected tax break of 4.8%, while other brackets mostly receive a 1.5-2% break.

However, this study excludes some aspects of the plan that would help close that gap. For example, working seniors (who are likely to be lower income) would receive a payroll tax cut, while hedge fund managers would lose a tax break on carried interest.

Not the theroy but it is all that happens in practice. We don't have to talk about this as a theroy we have practical examples. 

>The Laffer curve illustrates a central theory of supply-side economics, that lowering tax rates may have a positive impact on work, output, and employment and generate more government revenue than would otherwise be expected at the lower tax rate due to the tax cut's economic effect.[5] However, the Laffer curve only measures the rate of taxation, not tax incidence, which is a stronger predictor of whether a tax code change is stimulative or dampening.[6] In addition, studies have shown that tax cuts seldom recoup revenue losses and have minimal impact on GDP growth.[7] Brookings Institution asserts that tax cuts will likely increase federal budget deficits unless funded by offsetting spending cuts.[8]
