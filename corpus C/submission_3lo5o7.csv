3lo5o7,Am I the only one who supports the Free Syrian Army and other moderate rebels in the Syrian Civil War?,14,Ostridge93,"I support the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the Syrian National Council (SNC), the Kurdish Peshmerga, and other moderate rebels in the Syrian Civil War. I see President Assad as a war criminal who has lost almost all legitimacy to rule. That doesn't mean I feel that Daesh (commonly known as ""ISIS""), the al-Nusra Front, or other Salafist groups should take power in his place. I don't want anyone killing innocent people, no matter who they are or what they believe. To me, this is not an extreme or irrational point of view.

I honestly feel like the overwhelming majority of people view the war as a monolithic fight between secularists and Islamic extremists, with Assad representing ""the lesser of two evils"" against a hodgepodge of foreign-backed terrorist organizations. I want to see Syria rebuilt as a free, democratic nation-state.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lo5o7/am_i_the_only_one_who_supports_the_free_syrian/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442753049,1444726352
