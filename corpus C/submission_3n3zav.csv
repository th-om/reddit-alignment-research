3n3zav,Wha (in your opinion)t are thw most frustrating commonly held beliefs of each party's base?,45,slam7211,"Dempcrats: free/government paid for stuff means everyone will get it.

The reality is that free does not mean infinite it just means arbitrary rules will now govern availability of something (like say college education or healthcare) instead of the ability to pay for it. Everything is rationed by something, all this does is change what is doing the rationing. The difference is that government rules are a lot less flexible and harder to change than markets where money gets you what you need, and can create what you need if it is not already in existence. Not saying subsidies shouldn't exist, those can help but replacing the market with government fundamentally changes more than just who pays for stuff.

Republicans:
This country was designed as a Christian nation/ Christianity is ok to use as part of law but not other religions.

For the love of all things holy. NO. America is a Christian nation by population,  but our government was set up specifically to render this point moot. Also saying that one set of morals is ok to legislate because Christianity flies in the face of the constitution so please just stop.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3n3zav/wha_in_your_opiniont_are_thw_most_frustrating/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443712196,1444721039
