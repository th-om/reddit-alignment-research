cuwlgzz,0,t1_cuvoasr,kingvitaman,"The crux of the matter is what it means to ""make up"" a modern religion. Obviously Mormonism, and Scientology are both good examples of religions which were written by men during the 20th century ( late 19th for LDS?). There are also religions which are well established which were only recognised in the latter half of the 20th century ( native american faiths ) of which some who are not natives can also be admitted. Hence we can have some individuals where the consumption and possession of peyote is not illegal. 

The idea of joke religions is actually more difficult to parse than many in this thread would like to admit. For millenia the formation of religions were based largely upon disagreements in doctrine ( Lutheranism) which were also created by men who had differing philosophies. Hell, basically every single denomination was formed this way. We also know that religion is constantly in flux. A modern day Baptist from Kentucky looks quite different than did a century ago. Quakers don't sit around and ""quake"" and make furniture anymore, they've also undergone a change. 

So when something like the Church of Cannabis comes around ( which is a recognized religion by the way ) it's hard for the government to be in a position that tells its adherents that their faith isn't real, or is just ""made up"". So no, it isn't ""clear as hell"" that some religions should be treated differently. It's actually quite nuanced. ",1,0,1441879155,1444731294

I would.  I'm not religious and even though I enjoy his show, [which offically sactioned a church, Our lady of Perpetual Exemption](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/24/john-oliver-s-bogus-church-is-a-huge-success-thousands-of-dollars-received.html).  if he suggested that suddenly start only going to businesses that are part of his church, or suggest that I only do business with other members of this church, I'd say fuck that. I think most of his fans would, because that would be stupid. 

> Do you think his viewership would be upset about tackling hypocrisy in government and law or support for gay marriage?

I think they'd be upset by him commanding us to follow a completely unreasonable dogma. ",1,0,1441817735,1444731298

OP doesn't tell us how this expected behavior is communicated.  But it would have to be, right? Otherwise there's no reason to think people would just start ""following"" this rule.  Is it a Suggestion?  Command?  I don't know.  But I think John Oliver would have to say something to the effect. I'm saying, (going back to a real world) if he did actually suggest that, he'd lose support. ",1,0,1441822979,1444731298

One would assume it would be via satire, you know, as the entire thing would be satirical and quite obviously not intended to be taken as a real religion.  This wouldn't be particularly out of the ordinary for anyone who's watched his show.

The only people I could imagine him losing the support of are people who are so hung up on the idea of even **pretending** to follow a satirical religion that they get upset about the suggestion.  While I'm sure those people exist it's not common, as evidenced by his prior fake religion satire.",1,0,1441823160,1444731298
cuvv3mo,0,t1_cuvuxaw,WhiteyDude,"Ugh.  This is why I fucking HATE hypothetical questions.  It's all nonsense. 

However, OP is also suggesting we weigh the impacts of society once John Oliver supporters start actually following this suggestion.  ""What would the ensuing court battles look like?""  he asks. In OP's hypothetical scenario, John Oliver's followers actually do start to discriminate businesses based on affiliation to this non-religion.  

It's a stupid hypothetical.  Let's stop arguing this and start arguing about something real in some other thread.  ",1,0,1441823425,1444731298

I don't see a problem with someone making a civil disobedience point assuming the objective is admirable.   it's like Colbert and his Super Pac.
