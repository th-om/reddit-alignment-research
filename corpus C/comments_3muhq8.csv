>I stated specifically, with Telsa as an example, about price controls on cars for eliminating pollution. Telsa, for example, could be told they have to sell their cars for less than $20k, allowing Americans of all economic classes, to reduce their pollution.   

Tesla is not a great example for other reasons. They have already made available most (all?) of their patent portfolio for use by others. Furthermore, most electric vehicle purchases allow a $7500 federal tax credit. In other words, they're a subsidized section of the market. They're not brought down to your 20k mark, but our current toolset is being used to reduce the costs associated with electric vehicles.

It seems that you want to debate the merits/criticisms of changing the United States into more of a planned economy. Currently we would probably be regarded as a mixed economy. The government sets limits or provides subsidies for some industries in order to keep prices stable, or to promote job creation, or to expand industries viewed as important for the future. 

However, what we usually don't do is set prices. Perhaps most importantly, setting prices as opposed to subsidizing is more inflexible than the market may require. If manufacturers have capped prices they can't as easily weather supply chain problems, and are not incentivized to provide for multiple segments of the market. Some people are obviously willing to pay more than 20k for a high performance electric vehicle. Tesla or other manufacturers would be spurning profits and growth potential if they were disallowed to sell to this market.

One might reply that the legislature could craft limits to be more dynamic or open, or to respond in a timely fashion to new economic circumstances, but both are tough asks. More dynamic laws are certainly possible, but it will be harder to predict their outcomes, and to my mind seem more likely to have loopholes. Political solutions generally are likely to be too slow, at least with the law creation process as it currently exists.

Anyway, despite my efforts and those of some others here, you're likely to get far better and more complete discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of a planned or command economy and when they apply by using Google than Reddit.",1,0,1443555006,1444722248

The point is usually.  Which is dependent on the situation for the public interest (*regardless if it is long term damaging such as rent control*).  If we were to keep that view and apply it more universally, the drug market wouldn't have price controls as we would want to prevent damaging policies that would limit future investment and progression in the field.

Electricity, water, heating, auto insurance and public transportation are usually regulated in most places in the US. In these cases, companies must apply to the government to raise rates. Often, the government allows rate increases if a good reason is provided. Regulations also exist to provide a certain minimum level of quality (clean water, constant electricity, constant gas, required liability coverage).

Food prices aren't regulated as much as regulations keep food prices low and stable. Also, minimum quality regulations keep food relatively safe for consumers.

Rent control was tried and that didn't work primarily because while housing is necessary, location is a luxury and quality differs locally unlike water and electricity.

Cars are obviously not a necessity, so you can see how people think that the example is bad.

Should we regulate drug prices? I would say ""yes, if..."" and I'm not entirely sure what to say next. It would surely include an immense amount of regulations and subjective regulatory parties.",1,0,1443553150,1444722276

That being said, pricing controls don't address the symptom of the issue. Drug costs are high *because* of government controls and regulation. When the federal government restricts itself from negotiating drug cost and forbids its citizens from buying drugs overseas, it restricts the market and allows for de-facto monopolies. Instead of implementing more regulation, we should allow US citizens to buy foreign drugs and allow the Feds to negotiate payment for drugs like nearly every other country.

Well, they are high in large part because of high research costs AND the need to ensure that drugs are safe.  The gov't isn't restricting the market for fun: if you don't do extensive testing to ensure that drugs are safe (both newly developed drugs and those that are physically produced outside the country), people are hurt, sickened or killed.  At the very least, they don't get better and it's wasteful...

We could streamline the gov't patent and approval process, but there's always going to be a pretty large cost associated with ensuring that new drugs are safe, no getting around that.",1,0,1443544620,1444722281

Government policies have given drug companies the power to set prices higher, so it shouldn't be surprising when the government wants to tweak the rules so that it isn't *too* high. In other words, it's not a price control in the sense that the government is setting a price ceiling, but rather a price control in that the government wants to lower the price floor they've set.

For drugs under patent or under certain incentive programs, a manufacturer is granted a monopoly over the product, which gives the monopolist seller the power to set any price it wishes. 

It's natural for the government to say ""wait we've caused the price to go too high, and it's all profit for the monopolist."" So the government has a choice between forcing the monopolist to lower the price (a price ceiling) or by removing some of the price-increasing policies. The end result is still a higher price than what would have occurred under a non-monopoly system, but it is lower than what is occurring with the monopolist abusing its market position.

The intersection between patents (and similar government market protections) and antitrust is complicated, and requires careful policy setting.",1,0,1443647286,1444722281
