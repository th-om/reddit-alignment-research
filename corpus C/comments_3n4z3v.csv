Yes, but considering now the government is requiring every eligible adult who would like to vote in election to get an ID is followed with mass closures of issuers of those IDs, the timing is a little bit more than suspicious.

Also consider the fact that ALEC, a conservative think tank, has been the one pushing for both voter ID and DMV closures in Republican-controlled states.

One thing that you didn't consider: proximity. If there are several countries in a row, it could be an hour's drive to a DMV, which is quite a struggle without a license.

I actually did give that a thought, but the 2 issues that came up were:

 1. I have no idea where to find the sort of data needed to analyze at that geographic resolution, and I sort of suspect it doesn't actually exist in a tractable format, though I could certainly be wrong, so the concern, while reasonable, is also effectively impossible to falsify, and
 2. In order to have the data at the level of aggregation I was able to analyze come out so equitable, but have a significantly disparate impact on blacks at the ""average individual distance to nearest DMV"" level, someone would have to analyze that data set, that I suspect to not even exist, at a level of complexity/nuance just short of what you most often see in analysis of particle accelerator data or in the trade-secret algorithms used by firms on Wall Street.

Those things being the case, it's not completely outside the realm of possibility but, even if it happened to be the case, it would take an approximately ""9/11 was an inside job"" level of paranoia/skepticism, in my opinion, to believe that it was intentional on the part of Alabama legislators, rather than dumb luck.

All that being said, I *might* look into how fine of a population resolution it's possible to get, and if I can get it at a scale that's significantly smaller than, say, the average distance between a DMV and its 3 closest DMVs, then I think it would be interesting to do that analysis.

There are no uniform and replicable truths about human affairs; indeed, this is the great failing of ""scientific socialism"" that it claimed a generalized truth about human society and then extrapolated from this to a political theory end. ""Political science"" is a horribly mislabeled field, as it is either theory or mathematics. Data about politics in a vacuum are useless without the political context which they are in. This differs from young earth creationism in one particular and simple way: Valid statistical and scientific evidence can point in either direction for this problem, but there is no such valid scientific argument for a young earth. That is the great difference between society and science: science done properly should converge to a truth, but society cannot.

Even if there were to be no statistical correlation with one method of determining effect, that does not mean your analysis is a general truth. On the contrary, there is non-statistical evidence which clearly states their intent, external to the question of impact. We must look skeptically at any one analysis which runs contrary to the non-quant explanations of what us ongoing, more so than analyses which go contrary. Just because data is non-quantifiable does not mean they are invalid. It is far simpler to assume an error in the data analysis than the pantheon of evidence to the contrary being incorrect.",1,0,1443814271,1444720914

Except I'm not saying it's a general truth, I'm saying it's a specific truth - in the specific instance of the pending DMV closures in Alabama, there is currently more *hard* evidence that the action was motivated by non-partisan, budgetary concerns, than there is that it was motivated by racism/political maneuvering.

To put it another way, there is plenty of non-quant evidence for Republican politicians being racist *in general*, but there is *zero* evidence that that's the cause of this *specific* situation. It's a false positive based on having an imbalanced training set that skews heavily towards Republican politicians being racist.

>On the contrary, there is non-statistical evidence which clearly states their intent, external to the question of impact.

The ""pantheon"" of evidence you are pointing to is equivalent to there being a lot of ducks in an area. If 99% of the waterfowl at a particular lake are ducks, then it's reasonable to assume that, if you choose one at random, it will be a duck - *however* if the one you choose looks similar to a duck at first glance, but then you look at it closely and it's clearly not a duck, continuing to assert that if we genotype it, it will turn out to have been be a duck the whole time, simply because 99% of the waterfowl in the area are ducks, is asinine.

I'm not saying that 99% of the things Republicans do that look racist aren't racist - quite the contrary, my initial assumption was that this *was* racist, and I feel entirely statistically justified in that assumption, **however**, when you dig in to the data and find zero evidence of that, the **logically sound** conclusion to draw is that, *in this particular instance*, you've run across the 1% of waterfowl at the lake that *aren't ducks*.

If you don't do that, if you start identifying waterfowl based on a set of rules such that, since 99% of the waterfowl are ducks, *all* the waterfowl are ducks, no matter what closer observation tells you, then you aren't basing your criteria on a statistically valid assumption any more, you're just calling every bird at the lake a duck, which is **utterly worthless**, because *we already know the lake is full of ducks*.",1,0,1443816207,1444720914

What you would need to show is either (1) that it's facially neutral with discriminatory effect or (2) discriminatory on its face. To provide evidence towards this, you should look at all of the DMVs state-wide and look whether or not the DMV closures disproportionately effect the African American population. 

However, even if you are able to show this, it still might not be enough. There could be other factors at play that might cause those particular DMVs to close (e.g. the African American neighbors are poorer neighborhoods and therefore use the DMVs less frequently and therefore those DMVs have more budget issues). Now, the right to vote is a fundamental right and race is a suspect class, so the government would have to meet the strict scrutiny standard (necessary to meet compelling govt purpose) to show that it's reason was justifiable, which would be hard, but not impossible. 

However, this is all couched in the assumption that you can show ""closing a local DMV"" = ""voter suppression"" or some equivalent thereof. While it's easy to argue this is true (and there's almost certainly statistical evidence to back up such a claim), it's not a direct link and would prove to be another hurdle in any successful lawsuit.

**The studies available have widely varying percentages to report on this.**

In this one was 4563 voters. In the survey, 10 percent of blacks, 11 percent of Hispanics and 5 percent of whites said they did not have a valid driver's license or an ID issued by their home state.

http://latinodecisions.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/the-disproportionate-impact-of-stringent-voter-id-laws/

Except that they were written in prior to the establishment of this country and carried over from that common law. You're making assumption about their original intent that conflict with the historical context. Those common laws even predate slavery by several decades.

If you were to enact them today it would be different. But the argument then was that owning land provided you with an incentive (or level or risk/stake) in being an active member of civic life. Land was cheaper in proportion to income then, but not within areas that would have had any influence on government.

Voter education tests clearly were meant to discriminate given their application and historical context. As were others. The admissions for many of them exist too. It's an extreme stretch in logic to try to claim this is the case here.

Slow down there! You are making an unsupported assumption.

Right now, since they can't ask for an ID, they have literally no way to stop in person voter fraud or even gauge it.  Saying that in person voter fraud is virtually non-existent is as true as saying that there is zero intelligent life on other planets in the universe - you are claiming your failure to measure something will result in an answer other than we do not have data on the subject because it isn't measured.    Anyone can vote as me  if they have my address and are willing to say they are me - there is absolutely no way they can be caught unless they brag about it (*Melowese Richardson is a good example*). 

How can they not get caught you ask?  The better question is how can they get caught?  There is no check if you are the person you claim to be and no evidence to identify you later if you aren't.  Look at who is caught for voter fraud - people that moronically vote multiple times under their own name or people that vote multiple times with absentee ballots, that's it.  People may say ""But they have to sign next to their name!"", which does nothing.  With just a forged signature of someone else and no other data, what do you think the odds are that it goes anywhere?  ",9,0,1443734174,1444720938

First, you have to prove who is the correct person.  We don't have a check point for that at all without an ID.

Second, as for reports of people that show to vote and someone voted already, there is no registry of that.  I would know.  In 2008, someone voted under my name.  I got to the polling place at 7:45 am and was told that I already voted (*NYC opens at like 6am*), which I dispute as I had not voted yet.   After going back and forth with the polling station workers, they refuse to give me a ballot and tell me that I have to vote on a provisional ballot that most likely won't be counted.   I followed up on the event and was told that they have no means at all to determine who voted under my name, effectively denying me the right to vote, and they refused to mark it as voter fraud since they no means to determine who voted under my name.  

Checking an ID takes a second and stops fraud like that, fraud that is not considered fraud because they have no way of tracking it.  Under that same logic, if we took measures to prevent people from being carded when purchasing alcohol or cigarettes while also making it illegal to determine the BAC of a minor, we would completely stop minors from underage drinking and smoking.

The form proves/shows that a discrepancy, possibly fraud but also possibly a mistake, occurred that caused an irregularity.  It's a tracking mechanism designed to provide evidence that the substantial burden of presenting ID is justified.  And it's easy to do.

>  You are saying that the victim must be completely responsible for not just solving the crime but designing their own preventative measures. 

The 'victim' isn't responsible for anything.  I'm talking about what a State who wanted to show that an actual issue existed would do to document that.  States currently haven't taken these extremely simple actions to even attempt to do so.

> And as for burden, what are you talking about? Its now my burden to show that I should be allowed to vote? 

It's the State's burden to show why they are restricting people's right to vote.  It has nothing to do with you personally.  Anytime you want to restrict a right, you should be able to document why.

> Any voter fraud is too much. Its not a question. 

That's only your opinion and certainly not a factual statement.  It is purely impossible to defend against all forms of voter fraud, just as it's impossible to defend against other crimes on a 100% basis.  You only want to try to defend against those that cause a meaningful problem, and there's no evidence that in-person voting fraud causes a meaningful problem.  At all.

Just because there are excuses that, on their face, are neutral doesn't mean that this wasn't planned. More simply put, if DMVs were suffering budget shortfalls, why not allocate more money?

cvmygsk,0,t1_cvllug4,DumbScribblyUnctious,"> justify the bullshit

There's more bullshit in the article than there is in this comment section. The article is attempting to draw the conclusion that the DMV closings are motivated by racism (simply looking at the number of counties effected makes that implausible), or that the DMV is the only outlet of photo ID accepted at in-person polling places (it is not).

The article selectively omits a great deal of very relevant information and is clearly working very hard to paint a specific narrative.

The burden of proof to support the accusation is on the accuser. I find the provided proof to be exceptionally weak. If someone can prove a motivation to discriminate was involved in selecting counties to close DMVs (even if the result wasn't effective) they can do so. But to bend over backwards to support an accusation that is so glaringly full of holes is absurd and dishonest. Lies you want to agree with for whatever reason are still lies.",1,0,1443896668,1444720951

cvkukau,0,t1_cvktzv7,LiberalTerryN,"Way more complicated than that. The state can set rules for when it can or can't be sued, so it's more of a blanket rule rather than a case by case basis of ""ok fine I consent to be sued by this guy.""

Then, you have the fact that even though states can't be sued (sometimes), government officials can be sued. So if you can identify a particular official who is doing something wrong (even if just following the state law), you can sue that person individually and, in effect, force the state to defend its policy.

Finally, federal laws passed under the Fourteenth Amendment (any anti-discrimination or civil rights legislation that forbids states from doing certain things) can override the states' immunity (technically called abrogation of state sovereign immunity).

And as the other comment references, states don't get immunity from suits by the federal government (or other states, but that's not relevant here), especially on civil rights issues.",6,0,1443727860,1444720954
