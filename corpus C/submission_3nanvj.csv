3nanvj,How likely is a Bush/Rubio or Rubio/Bush GOP ticket?,34,rabidstoat,"Many people seem to be thinking that either Bush or Rubio have the best chances to win the nomination.^1 Supposing one or the other does, indeed, win. What are the odds of them picking the other person as their running mate?

I've heard that they're BFFs from way back, with Bush mentoring Rubio and saying good things about each other. And I've heard that they're on the verge of being at each others' throats now because of the competition between the two. I don't even know if it would be politically advantageous for the two to pair up, as compared to other options.

So any thoughts?
