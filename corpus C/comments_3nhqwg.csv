cvojfi7,1,t3_3nhqwg,LiberalTerryN,"In some ways, the terms in a legal document *must* change in meaning. In 1795, the word ""President"" meant George Washington. In 2015, it means Barack Obama. Obviously, this is by design.

So the real question becomes, which words or phrases in the Constitution have flexible meanings depending on contexts, to include contexts not originally envisioned by the drafters? When the Fifth Amendment says that someone can't be deprived of ""property"" without due process of law, what is ""property""? Does that include the Framers' understanding of common law real property, like land? Sure. But does it include something like a retired veteran's rights medical care at a VA hospital? Does it include the FAA/FCC license to place a communications satellite in a particular geosynchronous orbit? Would the framers even understand what a communications satellite is?

Obviously the ""arms"" in the Second Amendment includes firearms and technologies not understood by the framers. And ""due process"" means different things in different contexts. And ""cruel and unusual"" probably depends on contemporary understanding of punishment.

So this thread, while well intentioned, doesn't really advance the discussion unless we stop and ask which particular term or phrase in the Constitution we're talking about.

cvosjkq,0,t1_cvojygh,LiberalTerryN,"> first part of Article I.

But there are fierce debates about the appropriate way to interpret certain terms in Article I. Congress had the power to regulate ""commerce,"" among other things, ""among the several states."" And loaded within that phrase are a lot of tough questions. What is ""commerce""? What is ""among""? Does that mean that states can prescribe their own standards for use of their waterways coming from other states? Can states regulate the intrastate portion of an interstate train route? What are the limits? Can the federal government regulate the entire production process of a good just because it eventually crosses state lines? What if a particular practice affects interstate commerce but isn't itself interstate?

> Some people don't think that, which is the point.

Nobody takes a hard line that something like ""bill of attainder"" means only exactly the type of parliamentary bill by that name, because it would be absurd to allow Congress to target an individual in a clever way that doesn't look like the old ways. It stands for the principle that Congress doesn't have the power to target out individuals for punishment. It doesn't matter if Congress innovates a particular way to target those individuals in a way that the Framers never envisioned.

The power to raise an Army or a Navy includes the power to create the Department of the Air Force. The power to create a postal service includes the power to create postal roads. The Constitution doesn't seem to explicitly authorize the right to acquire property from foreign nations (like the Louisiana Purchase). Article III doesn't explicitly give the courts the power to strike down unconstitutional statutes. But these are things we recognize as appropriate, and aren't controversial. Any principle we want to apply for interpreting the Constitution's controversial parts should consistently apply to the noncontroversial parts. So a hard ""always do exactly what the Framers meant"" doesn't even help for the portions where the Framers meant the meaning to be flexible with different contexts. ""Limited times"" in the copyright clause is intentionally deferential to future Congresses to set the exact term. ""Officer of the United States"" is intentionally vague and allowed the creation of all sorts of politically appointed positions in the government's cast administrative bureaucracy.

The problem you run into here is that technically, all punishment can be qualified as cruel, which is why I think that unusual is the more important word. So that's why I think it's better read as ""punishment that is both cruel and unusual"" because you could make a strong argument that jail is a ""cruel"" punishment.

Although generally nonexistent among politicians on the national level right now, there is also quite a bit of visible talk among members of the base regarding a litmus test regarding ""Obamacare.""

Yes, it was absolutely vague. I don't mean to be rude, but you obviously haven't studied law. Law is intellectual boxing over language, and the cruel and unusual punishment example is fertile ground for argument. You could argue that solitary confinement is cruel and unusual. In fact, the nature of punishment itself is intended to be cruel and unusual. So by your logic, it could be very obvious that a prison sentence is a violation of your constitutionally defined rights.

I'm not promoting it. It's a hypothetical to illustrate the vague nature of the clause.

cvp5j4e,0,t1_cvopybi,creativeocelot,"Okay, I'm going to walk you through this, after reading it again, I can see how you're getting confused.

*Step 1:* OP engages on your statement that subjective law is no good, and all law must be read literally.

*Step 2:* OP refutes your argument that ""cruel and unusual"" can be read literally, by utilizing the words ""cruel and unusual"" through a different understanding, most notably the understanding of ""unusual"" has been modified to mean ""unique to the defendant"" instead of ""uncommon or socially unacceptable"", which is what it's  commonly understood to mean. You concede that the clause is vague.

*Step 3:* Here's where OP kinda fails, and it's why I think he's just a student, and not an attorney. The connection should be made that because the clause is vague, along with dozens of other clauses in the document, it necessitates interpretation to be utilized. Even if you stick to the common definition of ""unusual"" you still have to qualify the clause, it can't be read literally in the same way that some of other parts of the Constitution can be.

Step 3: Because vague law is inherently subjective, it must be bad law from your view. So, the 8th is bad law. Here you come out of left field and start talking about law professors teaching the 8th as ""tautology"". While this would never happen, OP's reasoning is exactly what they look for; so long as your logic and reasoning are consistent and well argued, you will not be graded poorly in law school for making an argument that is morally questionable, or contrary to popular judicial interpretation.


Step 4: OP would have taken the final step, but you kinda derailed the conversation. The final step is that the establishment that many clauses necessitate interpretation effectively contests your original assertion. It leaves you with a tough argument to make to defend your original statement that subjective law is bad law, because that that means that much of the constitution is ""bad"". 

Also, because you conceded that the clause is vague, by default you admitted that some parts require interpretation. These parts can't be interpreted literally, leaving you with an even tougher argument to make to defend your original comment. Not impossible though.

2- Necessary and Proper Clause - This was a huge one that SCOTUS wrangled. What constitutes necessary and proper? For me this was Marshall's finest opinion, throughout he exercises that the founders acknowledged that there were varying degrees of necessity, so necessary is a term that requires interpretation.

3- Commerce Clause - This is a big one, it does not me does not provide a strong definition of what constitutes ""among the states"" or ""commerce"". To non lawyers it may seem trivial, but in application the lack of a solid definition of what constitutes ""inter-state commerce"", or even ""commerce"" is very confounding. States have argued that commerce does not include manufacturing, navigation or cultivation, just the literal sale of goods, and used this to defy federal child labor laws, anti-monopolization laws, minimum wage laws etc.

*[The Congress shall have Power] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;*

>That seems to be explicitly contrary to their intention,

The founders were not unified ideologically, in fact they were in fierce disagreement on a lot of issues. You could argue that the Jeffersonians would favor strict constructionism, but the Federalists would not. Even so, it was Jefferson himself who decides that issue for me, he argued that the constitution should be re-written every 19 years, exhibiting that he did not want the document to become absolute dogma like it has. It also makes obvious to me that he recognized that the document would not be indefinitely applicable.

*Every constitution then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force, and not of right.--It may be said that the succeeding generation exercising in fact the power of repeal, this leaves them as free as if the constitution or law has been expressly limited to 19 years only. In the first place, this objection admits the right, in proposing an equivalent. But the power of repeal is not an equivalent. It might be indeed if every form of government were so perfectly contrived that the will of the majority could always be obtained fairly and without impediment. But this is true of no form. The people cannot assemble themselves. Their representation is unequal and vicious. Various checks are opposed to every legislative proposition. Factions get possession of the public councils. Bribery corrupts them. Personal interests lead them astray from the general interests of their constituents: and other impediments arise so as to prove to every practical man that a law of limited duration is much more manageable than one which needs a repeal.*

While I don't agree with his politics, I can't deny that the man was brilliant. Probably far smarter than I am.

Some parts of the Constitution are very specific such as housing troops while others are as specific as they could get with very broad and complicated stuff.

A SCOTUS judge has a single purpose and that is to apply the law. This means they take the text of the constitution and apply it in cases where it seems uncertain. If the text is vague they should read up on all the framers of what they said about the provision. Law is often the comprise of multiple parties, so taking the opinion of one of the participants is a violation of their office (several cases were decided in such a fashion).

So strict wording with the occasional framers intent when it's not clear. For instance birth right citizenship seems perfectly stated in the 15th amendment. But if you read the opinions of every single one of the writers they straight up state it does not apply to people from foreign countries.

The meaning of that document is known to be changing as circumstances change, with respect to who the beneficiaries of that will is.

We imply duties arising under contracts all the time, because we understand that circumstances change. So a residential lease contract in 2015 that promises a habitable home might require access to running water, electricity, and possibly heat or air conditioning, while that identical contract in 1815 might not have carried the same implications in the word ""habitable.""

Similarly, the FCC's authority under the Communications Act of 1936 to pass rules regulating radio waves that will serve ""the public interest"" (the actual statutory text), their actual rules about protocols, modulation techniques, power requirements, etc. have changed greatly over the last 80 years or so because the meaning of ""the public interest"" has changed as wireless communication has completely changed over time. This adaptability is by design.

Similar examples can be seen in the FDA's authority to regulate food additives that are generally regarded as safe (trans fats in 2005 were, but not in 2015), the FTC's authority to regulate unfair trade practices (like promises on labels for products that weren't invented when the FTC Act passed), or my employment contract that allows me to be disciplined or fired for violation of company policy, when that policy itself isn't part of the contract or can change over time. We see it in corporate charters, homeowner's association bylaws, collective bargaining agreements, etc.

Yes some aspects of the Constitution are left open, but the intent of those passages still has limitations on the scope of such interpretation. ""Freedom of press"" allows any American the ability to publish their words no matter how offensive the government finds them. With new technology such as the internet, the ability to publish their writing on the internet is such as freely protected as the *intent* (not spirit, that's just bullshit) still applies. We can also use framers intent from that to know that this protection does not protect defamation and graffiti on public/private property not of the owners. Yet the text reads that the right to a free press shall not be infringed by the government.

A blanket statement of ""strict interpretation"" doesn't really tell us anything about the words and phrases that were intended to adapt to the contexts that they're applied in.

Except had you read my post you would have understood the limitations. Strict interpretation deals with the intent/text of the law proposed. If the law is very specific, than no you cannot reinterpret it to meet modern day needs. For instance had the 2nd amendment guaranteed the right to muskets (specific) than you cannot apply that to all other arms/guns. This is why I strongly disagree with the courts regarding the right to Privacy, as the bill of rights dealing with privacy were very *specific* in what was not allowed.

Sometimes the intent is not specific as I pointed out above dealing with press. So technological changes don't require that a new amendment be added to protect publishing on the internet.

To put simply if you can interpret something specific like commerce beyond the scope of what the framers meant when they wrote commerce you have essentially passed a Constitutional Amendment without the amendment process. Constitutional amendments are hard to pass and require 3/4ths of the states to validate it's passage. The federal government (via the Constitution) was give zero power to change the Constitution (all 3 branches, judicial does not have this power). This doesn't mean judicial review can't happen.

Did the meaning of the phrase change, if the application of that phrase to a particular subject did? I'd argue that the meaning needed to change to adopt our changing understanding of that phrase, from including trans fats to excluding trans fats.

""Necessary and proper"" and ""cruel and unusual"" might be the most commonly recognized phrases that are context dependent. An un-air-conditioned prison in the deep south might qualify today as cruel and unusual, when such a prison obviously would not have been so before the invention of air conditioning.

> This is why I strongly disagree with the courts regarding the right to Privacy, as the bill of rights dealing with privacy were very *specific* in what was not allowed.

Then perhaps you misunderstand where the courts have found a right to privacy. It's loaded into the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment (when we're talking about the limits of federal power) or of the Fourteenth Amendment (for state power). It's the same clause that requires people to get a hearing before losing their food stamps, that requires courts to only exercise jurisdiction over people who have been engaged in activity in their state, that protects the right to abortions, that makes the states have to follow the bill of rights, that requires courts to ensure that defendants have notice of lawsuits against them before entering a judgment, that requires states to allow parents to send their children to private school or to teach their children foreign languages, and that requires states to recognize interracial marriages and gay marriages.

And with the intentional vagueness of the word ""due"" in ""due process,"" the situations in which one might say that a particular process is due will depend on the societal context, including contexts never before fathomed by the drafters. Moreover, the contexts might mandate a particular result in one era while mandating a different result in another. For example, I think there's a plausible argument that notifying someone of a lawsuit by publishing a notice in a newspaper no longer comports with due process, even if it was understood as fair notice when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. I think that the death penalty might be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual in modern society (although I'm on the fence, I understand the argument). And I think summarily executing deserters in a war zone without a trial might have been OK during the Civil War but is unconstitutional today (because the context gives a greater amount of process that is due).

So the disagreements between people on the proper interpretation of a particular constitutional provision isn't really between a vision of a living Constitution or a fixed Constitution, but rather whether a particular phrase is best interpreted to be flexible over time. Any overarching rule of constitutional construction is either going to be too general to provide useful guidance in specific cases or is going to be too inflexible to apply fairly to the entire Constitution.",1,0,1444079067,1444718894

And my point is the meaning didn't really change if the framers intentionally left it vague. How it is applied has changed. That vague clause in the Constitution does have limits though. You cannot infinitely interpret it to allow any powers within the federal government. That limitations is based on framers intent. How did the framers intend for that provision of the Constitution to mean.

Your example of trans-fats is dealing with specifics. Again, did the meaning of ""freedom of press"" change when we understood it as also applying to the internet? Nope. Freedom of press is the ability to publish so that others are able to read it. The intent is not limited by technology of that time unless they specifically detailed the methods in which it was protected. We don't have the freedom to publish only from the methods available at the time that amendment was passed. The wording doesn't support it, neither does the intent of the framers of that amendment.

>""Necessary and proper"" and ""cruel and unusual"" might be the most commonly recognized phrases that are context dependent. An un-air-conditioned prison in the deep south might qualify today as cruel and unusual, when such a prison obviously would not have been so before the invention of air conditioning.

And I would say that's a slippage of the intent of those clauses. That wouldn't be a legitimate example, as they are violating the intent of the law. Needless punishment that does not fit the crime would be unusual, cruel is definitely context dependent but was intended to bar torture as a form of punishment. Your example would be like a kid claiming his school forcing him to give a speech (public speaking) was cruel and unusual since it forced him into a extremely uncomfortable situation.

I'm sorry, but what a bunch of non-sense. I'm fully aware of the due process clause and the vast over interpretation the courts have done in the 20th century regarding it. Again due process and ""liberty"" are being liberally interpreted to mean whatever they want it to mean. You could essentially use this to claim there is a right of wearing funny hats, a right of being naked in public, a right to bitch slap anybody you see, etc. You cannot just imagine anything and everything as a ""liberty"" and then claim the government is unable to act without another clause that is liberally interpreted ""due process"".

Further more you still cannot extrapolate a ""Right of privacy"" from it (even with the ignoring the intent of the clause). The intent can be determined by any reasonable person not trying to exploit the clause by the very next segment:

>nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

They specify ""fair"" in terms of how property can be acquired for public use. The same principle is applied in due process as they are saying you can lose life, freedom and property as long as there is a fair legal process in which it is removed.

The right of privacy was derived not just from the 5th amendment but the 3rd and 4th amendments were sourced in the ruling as a basis that the framers saw a right of privacy. These amendments were specific in their intention, but the courts assumed broader meaning without actual intent to support it.

>And with the intentional vagueness of the word ""due"" in ""due process,"" the situations in which one might say that a particular process is due will depend on the societal context, including contexts never before fathomed by the drafters. 

Only in the mind of a justice attempting to justify their position within our government. Due process is a defined process setup by the government. So say we want to remove someones life via capital punishment. We have a process for that and it can't be expedited. That process that ends the life can be changed (though the courts would of course fight it to defend their Judicial Supremacy) as long as it is consistent and done before the crime it is to be applied to.

I don't have any historical text on hand for this amendment. Using a modern definition (which may not be accurate for the framers):

due(adj): ""of the proper quality or extent; adequate.""

Who defines that? Well the laws themselves of course. We have thousands of pages of criminal justice laws (just in a single state). 

>For example, I think there's a plausible argument that notifying someone of a lawsuit by publishing a notice in a newspaper no longer comports with due process, even if it was understood as fair notice when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.

This isn't some vague murky realm of technicalities. The laws can (and should) be adjusted if there are issues. It is not up to the opinion of a single justice, or the SCOTUS to suddenly decide that centuries of precedent are no longer valid. Society is not unable to act to reform it's own laws.

>So the disagreements between people on the proper interpretation of a particular constitutional provision isn't really between a vision of a living Constitution or a fixed Constitution, but rather whether a particular phrase is best interpreted to be flexible over time.

No, not at all. A living Constitution does not need to be amended because they can extend meaning/intent to provisions within the Constitution that never intended for such a meaning to exist. And in some cases it directly contradicts the framers intent. The courts have not ruled on this, but ""birth right citizenship"" another baby out of the 14th amendment that you forgot is being widely supported as a Constitutional Provision. This is in the face of every framer who helped write the 14th amendment specifically stating that it did not apply to people not from this nation.  A living Constitution is Kennedy in one of his latest rulings claiming ""Hey I just discovered a right that neither the framers who wrote the 14th amendment, nor the last 150 years of judicial review have ever even came close to considering"". It's a concept that based on the need of the time you can interpret clauses to mean more instead of having a new amendment to rectify the over sight. This is called Tyranny of the minority. As instead of how this country was actually designed (really hard to amendment the base foundation of this countries legal frame work even with a majority) a small group who stacks the courts can achieve what a majority cannot do.

It is unethical. It violates the rule of law. And generalized clauses are still limited by intent.

> Your example of trans-fats is dealing with specifics. 

That's true. But that's also what the courts have to deal with. The concrete dispute at the heart of a lawsuit is what courts have to decide, and they'll avoid making a call on the constitutional issue if it can at all be avoided. 

> I'm fully aware of the due process clause and the vast over interpretation the courts have done in the 20th century regarding it. Again due process and ""liberty"" are being liberally interpreted to mean whatever they want it to mean.

You're not the only one with this view, but there's [plenty of historical evidence that the drafters intended the Due Process Clause to have a substantive component](http://originalismblog.typepad.com/the-originalism-blog/2011/08/substantive-due-process-part-ii-ryan-williamss-basic-argumentmike-rappaport.html) and to act as a limit to the government's power, at least by the time the Fourteenth Amendment was drafted. The mechanism is that the process due is an impossible standard when a state wants to infringe on any fundamental right, including most of the Bill of Rights. That interpretation of the Constitution isn't that controversial (8 out of 9 current justices agree). It's the next step of asking ""which rights are fundamental"" that becomes difficult. 

The Supreme Court has found a fundamental right to have children, to educate their children without government mandates, to *not* have children (through either birth control or first term abortions), to marry someone of another race or the same sex, and to any of the rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights (except for a few). It also found a fundamental right to enter into contracts to work overtime, but it has since dialed back fundamental economic rights considerably.

> Again due process and ""liberty"" are being liberally interpreted to mean whatever they want it to mean.

And yet somehow the entire framework of how to argue a particular right is fundamental leads to predictable results in 99% of disputes. So obviously the doctrine is grounded in some kind of bedrock principle that is possible for any first year law student to understand.

So that's my argument. Certain phrases are loaded with ambiguity, which allows for flexible interpretation *by design*. The dispute is over the extent of that flexibility or which words were designed in that way, not the basic framework that I'm describing.",1,0,1444129122,1444718894

While Judicial Tyranny looks like a dictatorship, it really has no power to enforce itself. Public opinion is the only thing that makes it relevant. If people decided the court opinions held no weight this wouldn't be a problem (we would have other problems).

Why does this lead toward anarchy? Because each time they violate the rule of law, the less people have faith in the system. The more people lack faith in the system the less likely they are to follow the system. If people don't follow the system, the system breaks down. A break down of the system is anarchy. Generally anything can happen after this point (like a Dictatorship).

That is because a lot of it is based off of English Common law. They took things for granted. 

>It has been asserted that the framers expected, or even intended for judicial review to exist, because they chose not to explicitly prohibit it. 

And I would say the lack of outrage over judicial review from the framers supports this (most of them were still alive when judicial review was enacted). Judicial review is a logical application of their powers. As they are tasked with applying laws *under the Constitution*. They are not above the Constitution, but they still must apply the Constitution to congressional/state laws. This means in their application they are charged as the body to determine when there is a conflict. When that body acts in a bad way (such as making up Constitutional law from the bench to suite their political interests) than they are no longer ""under the Constitution"" and have violated the office that they hold. Thus congress should (but hasn't) impeach such abuses of power by the judicial.

The Constitution specifies all powers of the federal government. Those not ""explicitly stated"" are actually left to the states and to the people (clarified by the 10th amendment). A lot of things were not prohibited to the courts (such as having it's own army) but we're not going to presume to think that it can have an army.

>I don't know that I necessarily agree, I find original intent to be of fading importance the further away we are and the more our country evolves from the days of ratification.

Again this is a matter of rule of law. If you find the Constitution dated, get the Constitution changed via the amendment process. I might find the speed limits to be meant for elderly people and bad drivers, that doesn't mean I get away with speeding. No one is above the rule of law. Law comes from the democratic process in our Constitutional Republic. And it applies to everyone.

>After all, the Constitution once condoned slavery, and mandated the return of runaway slaves.

I'm only aware of the returning of slaves.

""No person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.""

The 3/5ths compromise existed to limit the power of the slave states. Else they would have been more representation in the house of reps from them.

That provision I quoted was changed by the Amendment process. All future amendments supersede older text/amendments unless the Constitution specifically states it cannot be changed.

>Times have changed quite a bit, and I don't know that the amendment process is the only tool we have to apply the document in the modern age.

When you live in a Constitutional Republic it is. You can pass an amendment to make it easier or allow different ways to modify the Constitution. The progressives in the early 20th century tried to do just this. It failed.

>a constitution [is] intended to endure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs

Which amendments do. The SCOTUS via judicial review can help to adapt stuff that was intended to be applied, but is not obvious. The intention needs to be there though. It can't just come out of the SCOTUS' ass.

>I think you mean 14th? Citizenship clause? 15th prevented race restrictions on voting.

Typo. Thanks.

>Isn't the following will of the ""public at large"" the entire point of a democracy? In this case which do you believe should be followed? Framers intent, literal interpretation, or the will of the people?

When dealing with the government and rule of law, it is always framers intent. If the public cares enough about it they will put pressure on their representatives to reform the system. That new reform will have it's own intent and text to support it.

I'm not in support of literal interpretation only. As it is impossible for those who compromised and crafted the bill to perceive changes in language/culture/technology. I have already seen numerous people attempt to back up their Constitutional assertions by applying modern usage of words to back up their claims. At the very least you would need to look at the intent of how it was used (such as the language/culture of the time).",1,0,1444076965,1444718894
