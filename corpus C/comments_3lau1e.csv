Yes people consider this.  I would put those people in the same category of removing the TBoR altogether.  The ignorants that don't know the history of republic governments.

Free, aware, people, don't make laws to make a government, so that this government can make laws for those people.  They make a law like this, so government will never be like a monarchy government again.  These people realize they don't need to put a murder law in this law because laws are for subjects and they know their rights.  One of them, the first being the right to life. 

Kings have rights and subjects.  Free, aware, people live as kings.  They certainly don't promote the government to remove a few specified rights telling government and them (apparently) they have rights.",1,0,1442547302,1444727576
cv4qs7k,0,t1_cv4pwqa,shadow776,"There actually is a federal law against murder (18 U.S.C. 1111), that applies to the ""special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States"". As well as many other federal murder laws for specific circumstances, like a ""drive-by shooting"" (18 U.S. Code § 36) or 18 U.S.C. 1958, ""use of interstate commerce"" in the commission of murder-for-hire. There are few homicides that the federal government could not find a law to prosecute under.
