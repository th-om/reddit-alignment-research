Sanders' plan is to let Medicare negotiate for drug prices the way Medicaid and the VA do, stricter investigation of and punishments for fraud (including loss-of-patent), ban pharmaceutical companies from paying their competitors off to not produce competitive generics, and allow individuals to import drugs from out-of-country.

As the US led an agreement called TRIPS a couple of decades ago which allows low-income countries to ignore pharma patents and middle-income countries to use mandatory generic licensing such that they pay <1% of the cost of high-income countries. As they have both stipulated similar licensing environment imports will only be permitted from other high-income countries.

The prices we pay for drugs are comparable to Germany and Japan, other countries pay less but most not significantly so. Canada is near the bottom of the cluster and the UK is an extremely low outlier due to the insanity which is NICE. The distribution of costs is not particularly equitable which results in higher costs elsewhere, Canada and the UK pay less at the expense of everyone else.

Our per-capita pharma spend is higher because we consume *far* more and consume a much larger proportion of branded drugs. Neither candidate has proposed resolving either problem, Clinton is proposing a system that would increase retiree drug consumption even though they already consume significantly more then their peers elsewhere in the world. The branded problem requires a regulatory change to how the FDA deal with bioequivalence and therapeutic equivalence to match how it works everywhere else in the world instead of our excess regulation in this area.

Allowing people to import drugs will go one of three ways;

1. Countries which currently underpay will bring up their payment rates such that they are equitable with their wealth.
2. Countries which currently underpay don't bring up their payment rates, as US consumers fund about half total worldwide development activity IND's drop spectacularly and we don't get new drugs.
3. Advanced economies write a treaty to finally deal with this issue, magically even though the EU haven't been able to deal with this problem in three decades the US becoming involved results in progress.

The game of chicken Clinton and Sanders are playing is inherently dangerous because it relies on the legislatures of other countries to take action for it to not devolve in to the 2nd option, it would be far more preferable for them to pursue the third.

While research is certainly mixed on if advertising is useful or not it doesn't have a statistically significant impact on drug consumption, physicians don't write simply because people ask them to do so.

> Considering other industrialized nations (all of them?) outlaw direct to consumer advertising, I'm struggling to see a reason why our model in that regard is preferable;

What other countries do is largely irrelevant when considering optimal policy. The US is responsible for almost all public vaccine research funding, because other countries spend much less should we do so too?

We see improvements in physician contact and communication (although fairly small improvements) for the first two types of advertisement (disease only, disease focused with brand mention) but do see negative effects from the third type (brand focused). 

Policy seeking to eliminate the third type would clearly be adventitious, for the first two the effects are so small that I don't really care if we enact policy to prevent them but people don't seem to really have any backing for why they want to enact the policy. The informational effects are largely the same as sites like WebMD, would you also propose banning those?

> Can you provide examples of bioequivalence regulation in the US that is more burdensome than Europe or Japan?

Easy example. In the US demonstrating bioequivalence isn't sufficient to meet substitutability (IE the drug wont be in the orange book), you also have to demonstrate bioavailability. Most countries additionally allow marketing approval for off-label uses without completing an efficacy trial if sufficient reported use data exists to support the license. Some countries (notably the UK) allow for therapeutic substitution without efficacy trials if sufficient use data exists to support the license.

The recent problem with pyrimethamine wouldn't have occurred elsewhere because there are only two countries that issue type 2 orphan licenses (US & Japan), its not necessary to run efficacy trials to get a license for off-label use.

> What percentage of worldwide discovery does the US already fund? In any case, this might not be such a bad thing across the board, but finding the sweet spot is problematic.

Between 34% and 47% depending on how you measure it. 34% of total worldwide pharma spending, 47% of total worldwide primary pharma spending (on-patent branded drugs).

On an expenditure basis the US excess over the advanced economy average is well in excess of total worldwide pharma profits.

> Are you against the existence of a powerful lobbying influence of pharma? 

I'm not against the lobby existing but rather the idea it has particularly significant influence, there are simply too many things the federal government does which are objectively bad for the industry for that to be credible.

Its from P0. PIII rises to 44%.

I cited this example because the idea PIII standards should be far weaker then they are currently is extremely well supported by the literature and accounts for 53% of total development cost, we have something that is well supported by the academic community, the FDA and industry yet somehow the powerful industry lobby has not been able to take action?

Why would pharma spend so much on advertisements to the general public if it had no effect on consumption if this were true?  Why not funnel those wasted dollars into research?  If I want longer boners, I can goto the doctor and say I want longer boners, or I want longer boners and I saw something about Cyalis.  If we are to assume that the people who develop and deploy marketing strategies are rational people who act in the interest of selling more drugs, can't we conclude that they aren't doing all of that advertisement for nothing? 

> What other countries do is largely irrelevant when considering optimal policy.

I'm unconvinced.  I am always skeptical with the notion that there is nothing to learn by examining how other countries craft policy, especially as in this case, other countries is every other country.  Without conflating advertisement policy and research directives, what is the benefit of direct to consumer advertising?  Why is our policy on advertisements optimal compared to how everyone else handles it?  

> The informational effects are largely the same as sites like WebMD, would you also propose banning those?

You are conflating people intentionally going to WebMD to seek out medical information with people watching a football game and having that data pushed to them.  What's more, the notion that a drug advertisement is similarly themed to a WebMD page strikes me as a bit disingenuous; one is designed to promote asking your physician for a *specific flavor* of drug.

> Easy example.

I figured you'd have data to this point.  

>  its not necessary to run efficacy trials to get a license for off-label use.

Do you mean, 'on label' use?  Why run any trials at all?  I'm of the mind that we may have gone a little bit buckwild on the off label thing, something some pharma companies have picked up some pretty big fines for.  

> On an expenditure basis the US excess over the advanced economy average is well in excess of total worldwide pharma profits.

Can you explain this to me like I am a fifth grader?

> I cited this example because the idea PIII standards should be far weaker then they are currently is extremely well supported by the literature and accounts for 53% of total development cost,

Total development of a drug that eventually makes it to market?  Or of all drug discovery efforts?   The values behind all R&D seem to be a moving target and a point of some controversy.  

I'd be interested in seeing a reference regarding wide acceptance that PIII standards are too difficult.  .  Do you have any examples of drugs that failed PIII that you (or the literature) think should have passed based on efficacy but failed due to a restrictive environment?  I'd love to read about them. 

> we have something that is well supported by the academic community, the FDA and industry yet somehow the powerful industry lobby has not been able to take action?

If it is supported by the FDA I'm not sure what the problem is?  Inertia?  

I guess when I see things like [this](http://www.medpagetoday.com/Neurology/Autism/53288) it makes me think that all things considered, our efforts at detecting efficacy and/or side effects are only as good as the gatekeepers ability to insure the data presented to them is accurate.  Getting there is a tricky thing with lots of moving parts, but I don't think that relaxing standards in PIII is the right way to go.

For generic drugs you don't have to prove safety (the compound has already been demonstrated safe) but rather just that its equivalent. For relatively new drugs this means running small clinical trials to demonstrate you have identical efficacy or that bioavailability is the same.

For older drugs you can piggyback on an existing marketing application, if you are using the same formulary you don't need to do any lab work other then demonstrating identical composition to the original drug.
