3kiyui,"Do you believe the government did a good job of investigating the 911 attacks? Is this possible to talk about without getting too ""troofy""?",68,kingvitaman,"Personally I subscribe to the belief that the real conspiracy involving 911 came after the attacks when the US invaded and occupied Iraq for over a decade, a country which had absolutely nothing to do with 911 even though the Bush admin claimed they were linked. 

But with that aside, I've seen some of the 911 docs, and they all seem to fall flat. Is there any irrefutable evidence involving 911 that doesn't involve a 22 year making videos on his computer with dramatic music, or reptile people? I'm aware of the 911 commission, and many have said it was inadequate, but why is this? Was there really a whitewash of what happened on this day years ago?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kiyui/do_you_believe_the_government_did_a_good_job_of/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441967594,1444730126
