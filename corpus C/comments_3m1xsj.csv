cvbdlbc,0,t1_cvbd70r,SirGallantLionheart,I don't think people know how tiring and time consuming campaigning is. Biden needs time to deal with his son's loss going on the trail now would likely be way too much stress for him.,12,0,1443019597,1444725161

cvbi9te,1,t3_3m1xsj,DoctorDrakin,"I would recommend you go watch his interview with Stephen Colbert. He seems to be legitimately conflicted. He is dealing with the loss of his son to brain cancer, I don't think his family and friends are 100% backing and supportive of a run, he is conflicted by the serious potential to lose and go out of politics on a low note/hurt Clinton and Democrats too much. It's a lot to to consider though I do think he really does want it. Endorsements are not the reason he is waiting.",7,0,1443026526,1444725161

cvbnpgb,0,t1_cvbk3l2,lightmonkey,"Not sure what you are asking about so:

Warren's endorsement is a loose support based on a signature on a letter of support. Obama's endorsement is based on tradition and sensibility. Biden not needing permission is self-evident. As for what Biden is waiting for, that is just the most reasonable conjecture based on the circumstances. ",1,0,1443034299,1444725169

I found it [here] and it's a secret letter from 2 years ago, a loose letter signed alongside all female senators.

I was just curious because [this year](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-119582) she said she wouldn't rule out supporting Bernie which sounds like her previously weak statement of support is essentially nullified at this moment.",1,0,1443036263,1444725169

cvb82mi,1,t3_3m1xsj,DevonWeeks,He doesn't need either of those endorsements to win.  Biden can thrive in the current political environment in a way Clinton can't.  Clinton is only sustained at this point by establishment support and because of a lack of serious candidates as alternatives.
