cuso1ji,1,t3_3jv04o,Daedalus1907,">Carson is very soft spoken and sounds like a fucking pansy. ""Please do this for me"". He sounds like Bob Ross. I can't see him negotiating with Putin or Shinzo Abe. 

Do you even understand how negotiations operate? It's not two people waving their dicks and screaming at each other. You can be soft spoken and be a strong negotiator. ",11,0,1441563782,1444732170

cuu5ptb,1,t3_3jv04o,jctennis123,"Op you are totally correct about Trump. However I believe trump is attacking Ben by calling him a 'nice guy'. If that label sticks then no one will vote for him. Look at what the 'low energy' label did to bush.

Most of reddit is very liberal so it's really cool that you are standing by what you say in this thread. Trump winning will fuck with a lot of people's world view.

They love the whole quiet polite thing because they are total pansies who got bullied and see trump as the childhood bully which pisses them off because he is such a success.",1,0,1441689582,1444732178
cuso7ox,1,t3_3jv04o,TRVDante,"Carson isn't attacking Trump, though, which is part of the key to his recent success. However, he can't go on forever with his code of silence. Eventually he'll either have to attack Trump and kill his populist cred or defend Trump and kill his donor cred.

Personally, I doubt Carson is even running to win, I think this campaign is just his method of jockeying for a VP spot. I haven't seen a single real policy plan put out by Carson, which ususally suggests that it's just a vanity run. ",1,0,1441564116,1444732178
