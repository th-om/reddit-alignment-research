3jzbcc,I'm beginning to think Dr. Ben Carson very well might win the GOP nomination.,20,ScatteredPictures,"Donald Trump is still #1 in the polls of course, while Carson is #2. But, when you pit only those two against one another head-to-head, [Carson wins by a whopping 19 points](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/poll-trump-still-leads-but-carson-beats-him-one-on-one/article/2571393?utm_content=buffer7e7e4&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer).

I used to think that when/if candidates start to drop like flies, support would flock to someone like Bush or Walker. Now, I think that support might go to Carson instead.

As I'm sure most of you know, the Iowa caucus begins the primary season, and right now [Carson and Trump are tied in Iowa](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/31/politics/poll-donald-trump-ben-carson-tied-iowa-monmouth/).

I've always written this guy off, but he manages to win the Iowa caucus, that could give him the momentum to win the nomination.
