* Alcohol - failure
* Drugs - failure
* Cuban cigars - failure

There is even a black market now for cigarettes which are not banned but merely taxed really high.

The government cannot keep people from the things they want. 

The government is powerless to protect you from the actions of bad people that the threats of incarceration do no not deter. You have to protect yourself until the police can reach you and then you have to protect yourself from the police.",7,0,1443976086,1444719469

cvnp8x3,1,t3_3nfs04,kingvitaman,"Access to guns is at the crux of the matter obviously. The US isn't special in the amount of crazy people it has. It's special in the fact that there are around 300 million guns, and it's not that hard to get one. And just so you know, I don't think any gun laws would really work in the US. It's too ingrained in the culture as a right akin to freedom of speech, or freedom from religion. So it's not going anywhere. 

But. At the same time there are already measures put in place to try and prohibit crazy people, and felons from having weapons. Society has already agreed somewhat on limiting access to these people. The question becomes who gets to say someone is crazy. Basically all of the shooters are young white men from average backgrounds, they're generally on medication, but who isn't in the US, and they tend to have feelings of ostracization. I think at the heart of it, these mass killings are rage of being ignored, and feeling unimportant. That's why they don't use bombs or poison to kill people. They want to rage and kill them individually at their hands. If you can't get rid of that rage, and young men continue to feel out of place and like little bitches, and they've got access to guns, then they're going to keep on murdering people for attention.

cvnoqdp,1,t3_3nfs04,sje46,"All of these mass shooters are different.  However, many/most of them are either underaged or have depression.  Even though they may be able to shoot up a school, they may not be able to go to a gun store and buy weapons, and especially not go to the ghetto and find a gun dealer. On a *social* level, they are not able to do something like that.  A lot of them use their father's guns, which are not properly locked up.  The close availability of the guns to them have a constant psychological impact to young men who feel like they have no power in life, and guns provide a sense of ultimate power and masculinity.

>It is the part of his story he wants to make sure people know: ""If there were no guns in the picture, it wouldn't have happened the way it did."" But wouldn't he have gotten guns illegally if he hadn't been able to get them from his father's gun closet? Wouldn't a person like him have gotten guns in any way he could? ""There is no way I would have bought an illegal firearm. I wouldn't have known how. I would have been too scared. When I was in jail, there were two kinds of inmates: There were criminals, and there were people who did crimes. The criminals are the people who'll get a gun no matter what. But I was a person who did a crime. There is no way I would have gone to the inner city and gotten a gun. If I was the kind of person who was able to do that, I never would have done the crime that I did.""

cvnqlkn,1,t3_3nfs04,imrightandyoutknowit,"From an incredibly simplistic economic perspective, a large number of guns that are easily available represents supply. Prohibition of guns (or even something less extreme like making guns so difficult to get the number of guns in circulation effectively dwindles) would therefore be the decimation of the supply of guns. However as (the) Prohibition (Movement) showed, prohibition as a policy, doesn't work. Prohibition in the early 20th created a black market for alcohol which in turn led to crime.

The other side of the equation, demand, is the reason why.  Instead, in order to really go after guns, demand has to go down. Take cigarettes for example, once the government got behind going after cigarette companies with anti-smoking ads and advertisement bans, the demand has dropped (in the U.S. anyway). Even then, this wouldn't necessarily dissuade mass shooters from shooting, moreso the average American with guns, in order to prevent more mundane gun violence like accidental shootings or suicide. 

That also raises the question of whether that's the proper role of government though. I personally wouldn't care if the government went this route, public health, safety, and welfare is obviously in the government's purview. It would still be legal to purchase guns and the people that want them will buy them regardless. Combined with proposals like better access to mental health, some gun control like background checks, and alleviating poverty, this could bring gun deaths down ",2,0,1443965983,1444719473

Very few major policies in the United States immediately go into action unless it pertains to a national crisis so I don't know what your point of stating that was. Considering how comprehensive and far reaching Obamacare was, would you consider 2014 to be immediate when the law was passed in 2009?

He went on: “A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more you’re in the limelight.

In Oregon, we saw the shooter posting on 4chan. In Virginia, the shooter even shot video for posting online. Are these ""beta-males"" finding the internet culture to be their catalyst, knowing that attention will come through the form of tweets, facebook posts, and a social media frenzy over their actions?

It seems like their was a concerted effort years ago to stop publicizes serial killers in order to prevent them from seeking the attention they wanted in the press and popular media. I don't think serial killers have gone away, but when was the last time you heard about one in the national news. Could a similar tactic work in preventing mass shootings, where they are not reported on nationally, tweeted on, shared on social media sites, and therefore lacking in the national media spotlight that some of these shooters obviously are aiming for?",1,0,1444045105,1444719481

Much like Chicago, you can ban guns all you want in Chicago but people will just get them elsewhere and have no impact whatsoever in violence. 

My personal views:  I hate guns. However, I value that responsible people can use them for sport and hunting.

cvoczyf,0,t1_cvo8n0z,Mymobileacct12,"With your edited prompt, I think it still comes down to the public opinion. I believe these incidents will clearly continue to happen without change (as they have since columbine). Mental health is likely one way to reduce the number of individuals who do this, but doesn't impact individuals not caught. If you look at it like probability, P-insane*P-access. Since the costs to absolutely reduce either P are exponential, optimally minimizing these events will likely restrict historical gun rights. Debates vary on which P can be most easily impacted, but regardless more government involvement is required (gun control or more state funded mental health). I think entertaining arming everyone is absurd (accidents and escalation incidents would exceed any benefit). 

The fundamental question is if society values the perceived benefit of gun ownership over the likely reduction in gun crime, including mass murders. Personally I do not buy the ""we police the government"" argument because a lot of the people involved are ex-military, meaning they fear that the next generation of military (often their children). That's paranoia. Further the weapons that exist today and tomorrow laugh at guns allowed under the 2nd amendment. If the US government decides to overtake the populace in earnest, it will be drones, bombers and tanks Vs semiautomatic assault rifles. Even further, the anti government people tend to be very easily aligned against ""others"" (homosexuals, liberals, minorities, etc) so anyone wanting to take power could easily invent an ""other"" and gain the support of the gun owners. As it was said, fascism will come to the US wrapped in a flag and carrying a cross.
