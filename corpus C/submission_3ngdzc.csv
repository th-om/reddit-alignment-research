3ngdzc,Silent majority?,51,The_seph_i_am,"So me and my wife were wondering.  Are the GOP still convinced they are the [silent majority](http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/john-feehery/184003-gops-silent-majority) and is this why they feel that not seeking a moderate/centralist candidate will work?

On the other side, do dems feel they are also the silent majority?  And this why the Dem est seem to back Clinton/Biden instead of candidate that may win votes on the other side of the isle too?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ngdzc/silent_majority/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443969146,1444718958
