3n0zl7,How would you improve the U.S. Infrastructure in 5 years to compete with China's production capability,30,The_seph_i_am,"You are the newly appointed secretary to the interior.  

The newly elected President has made it your mission to improve the U.S. Transportation/Port infrastructure to a point that allows the country to start to compete with China's production capability in 5 years.  And be fully capable in 20 years.

You have 8% of the GDP as your budget and must have visible (things reddit would say is ""real"") results by the first year.  How screwed are you?

Edit: sorry wasn't clear before by infrastructure I meant raw material supply lines needed for production.  (Stuff like zinc, copper, rare metals and such).  Over the years China has developed a considerable supply chain that dwarfs our own.

> Moreover, China’s dominance does not stop with extraction. After rare earths are mined, they must be separated, refined into metals, alloyed, and the products containing them must be manufactured. China also dwarfs other countries in these supply chain activities, producing 89 percent of rare earth metal alloys, and three-fourths of the world’s permanent magnets.4",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3n0zl7/how_would_you_improve_the_us_infrastructure_in_5/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443652432,1444721276
