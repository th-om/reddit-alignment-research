This is wrong. The Pope has to officially invoke papal infallibility and it is almost always used on defining church doctrine. This has only been done around 10 times in the 2000 year history of the church.",2,0,1443153281,1444724382

Jesus taught us as individuals to help the poor. He never said that the government itself should be a vehicle for Christian thought and actions. Rather, he seemed to have been pretty firm on the idea that state matters are better left to the state (to Caesar what is Caesars, etc.). 

I am in full support of people being charitable, *especially* those who are well off in this world. By no means does that mean our government should be run like a charity and abandon the greatest economic system developed yet.

Crony capitalism would be a better target for the Pope because it involves the perversion of a system that's largely based on fairness and merit into nepotism and negative greed.

I mean, even my basic and limited understanding of Catholicism indicates that this pope is speaking contrary to every single pope that has led that religion before him and in some cases the plain language of the Bible.  You're talking about a very old religion with a pretty consistent doctrine that is now, essentially overnight, having that doctrine turned on its head by a guy more interested in being a political activist than being a religious leader.  

As for Jesus's teachings being compatible with capitalism, I'm not really qualified to give any definitive analysis on that.  I can tell you this, though.  Jesus wasn't all that fond of tax collectors!  Not as a profession, anyway.  I mean, he said people should pay their taxes, sure (although I don't think he ever said how much exactly).  And, there's that story of the little guy in the tree who was a tax collector that Jesus befriended.  So, I'm pretty sure the overall message of personal redemption is still in tact.  But, on the whole, Jesus didn't like tax collectors and lumped them in with prostitutes, pagans, and other ""vile"" sinners.  Given that capitalism tends towards lower taxes or none at all, it's hard to imagine another system being more compatible with Jesus.  Plus, Jesus was a carpenter who worked (gasp!!!) for money as a young man!  There are plenty of biblical examples of capitalist-like transactions, so I don't see any way to make a case that Jesus is anti-capitalist.

Don't do business **in** church, though.  I remember that story very well, and Jesus will whoop your ass!",2,0,1443158762,1444724386

There is as much differing beliefs in all these groups as you would see in the political spectrum of the United States. Even among Catholics themselves you have liberalism and conservatism.

Anglicans are one of the most liberal Christian sects you can find while Southern Baptist, Presbyterians, and Methodist are among the most conservative. If you count Mormons as Christians then they are ultra conservatives (The church didn't allow African-Americans to join until 1978). 

One thing you really have to understand is that the majority of Americans are not Catholic. Although there is a lot of respect for the Holy Father among American Protestants they hold absolutely no loyalty to the Bishop of Rome and often disagree with the Catholic's views on religion. Let us not forget the religious wars of Europe which impact the way these groups feel about each other today.
