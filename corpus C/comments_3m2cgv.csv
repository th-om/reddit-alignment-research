And yes, sure, America is a constitutional republic. It is also a democracy (at least theoretically it is rule by ""the people"", through their representatives). They're not exclusive terms.

To the extent that amending the Constitution is possible, there is nothing theoretically preventing a supermajority of the population from infringing on the protection of any particular person's individual rights. In practice, infringing on the rights of individuals is done anyway (pick any minority and they've probably been discriminated against at some point).

Morality is irrelevant I'm afraid.

ˈpraktɪk(ə)l

adjective

1. of or concerned with the actual doing or use of something rather than with theory and ideas.

[Ayn Rand](http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/library/pwni.html): ""Formally, I call it Objectivism, but informally I call it **a philosophy for living on earth**.""

[The Objective Standard - What is Objectivism](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/what-is-objectivism/):
The Nature of Reality

Objectivism holds that reality is an absolute—that facts are facts, regardless of anyone’s hopes, fears, or desires. There is a world independent of our minds to which our thinking must correspond if our ideas are to be true and therefore of **practical use** in living our lives, pursuing our values, and protecting our rights.

[Ayn Rand's non-fiction at the Ayn Rand Institute](http://campus.aynrand.org/more/ayn-rands-non-fiction/): ""Ayn Rand’s lifelong passion for philosophy was rooted in her conviction that **philosophy is the most practical force in human life**.""

[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Ayn Rand](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ayn-rand/): ""Rand holds that philosophy, like all forms of knowledge and achievement, is important only because it is necessary for living a good human life and creating a world conducive to living such a life. Philosophy supplies the most fundamental cognitive and normative abstractions which, respectively, identify and evaluate what is. Everyone, according to Rand, needs a philosophy and is guided by at least an implicit one (1982a, ch. 1). Her novels express her belief that if our philosophy is more or less correct, our lives will be more or less successful, if our philosophy is wildly off the mark, our lives will be disastrous. **Philosophy thus has an urgent, practical importance**.""

If you shortened it down to the base of the story it's pretty entertaining: The World economy is slowing down and there just aren't resources to help people anymore. Nations get desperate and begin nationalizing industries in order to stay afloat. Meanwhile the best engineers and scientists around the world keep on disappearing for an unexplainable reason, which is causing economic chaos on a global scale. Since oil has become so expensive only trains can run, the CEO of the last train industry must find out about a new ""super engine"" capable of being so efficient it can jumpstart the economy again.
