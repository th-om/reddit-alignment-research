3nc6vf,Why do redditors tend to revere Europe as some kind of enlightened utopia?,160,JGand72,"On this subreddit, and others, many redditors seem to use Europe as the standard for the ""right"" way to do things.  I'm curious as to why; why do so many believe the the USA should become more Like Europe?

Edit: To add, we also often see comments such as ""well in Europe _______ would actually be considered right-wing"" as if that's the proper standard.

My first thought is that since Reddit skews pretty heavily left, most redditors align with the more liberal views of Europe.  However, is there something I am missing?
