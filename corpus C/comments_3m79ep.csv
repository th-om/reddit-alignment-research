I see a lot of Americans calling my country ""federal""; the United Kingdom is a unitary state, not a federal one, which is precisely one of the reasons the Founders chose a federal structure for the US after a confederal one clearly wouldn't work. 

Just thought I'd put my tuppenny in.

The U.S. doesn't have any socialist programmes; two things are required for something to be considered socialist: social ownership, and production for use. *Some* programmes might seem to fit this description, but the ideological connotations of the word make it somewhat disingenuous.

It has to do with how you interpret texts. That's the whole background to the dispute between originalism and loose constructionism in the Supreme Court.

Marxist historians (Eugene Genovese, for instance) have traditionally made a similar argument with respect to the Civil War.  The Civil War was not caused by the sincere political beliefs of southerners about state rights, it was instead caused by the fears of a powerful political class (wealthy plantations owners) who worried that the federal government could be used to take away their power and wealth (by abolishing slavery).  For socialists, the Constitution may have some nice features to it (first amendment, protection from unlawful searches, right to trial by peers, etc), values that were presumably produced by class struggles in the centuries preceding the creation of the Constitution, but the Constitution is also likely to have features that impede democracy (the way elections are carried out, the way it understands property rights).

Okay, that makes a lot of sense as a way to interpret the language. I think it makes *about the same amount of sense*, syntactically speaking, as the interpretation you are arguing against, so it certainly bears looking at the historical context for clarification.

>when he realized how poorly people were reading into that phase

Okay, so we know that the more general interpretation of powers is not some artifact of linguistic evolution - even in Madison's time, it was frequently read in that way. Now, although Madison may be the father of the Constitution, that doesn't make him infallible with regards to it, so what he intended when choosing to ratify it has only slightly greater weight than the intent of any of the other individuals involved in its ratification.

That being the case, and given that the general interpretation of powers was a common interpretation, it seems fairly likely that at least some of the other founding fathers ratified it intending the more general interpretation.

Now, it seems to me like, if that were not the case, and the more limited interpretation was overwhelmingly favored, that this endeavor:

>James Madison, the father of the Constitution itself, when he realized how poorly people were reading into that phase, advocated for an amendment restricting spending to the just the other enumerated powers.

would have been successful. Given that it wasn't, wouldn't the same logic you apply here:

> Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson 

Jefferson was on Madison's side.  Hamilton only changed his tune once the Constitution was ratified.  Before that, he wrote ""For what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power? Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars. But the idea of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning, and can have no other effect than to confound and mislead, is an absurdity.""

It's clear in the Federalist papers. In the Constitution? Not so much.

I'm using the word ""regulation"" because there isn't a good word for ""law that restricts behavior and isn't just the government hiring people to do stuff like any private citizen can"". The postal service is the one and only exception to that rule and no President, not even Madison, only spent their money on the postal service and ""regulations"". Hell, Madison signed off on the Bank of the United States.

Madison vetoed it the first time around.  Unfortunately, his hand was forced the second time because of how much Hamilton screwed it up.  It was impossible for Madison to be able to wage the war he had to without the resources in place that had been established when he wasn't in power.

As this ""power grab"" is restricted to federal spending rather than regulation, it's probably the only federal power that doesn't infringe upon state powers in any way. Obviously the states never had the power to spend federal funds, so giving the federal government more power to spend isn't taking that power from the states.

This makes no sense from anything else you've argued.  You're now taking my position, ironically, as I agree: the general welfare clause gives the government the ability to spend on what it can do.  But what you did prior to this (and then a paragraph later)?  You took the Hamiltonian viewpoint that the general welfare clause refers to spending on ""general interests"" of which there were no limitations.  (Hamilton: ""No objection ought to arise to this construction from a supposition that it would imply a power to do whatever else should appear to Congress conducive to the General Welfare."")

If you take my position, then you might be right: as it only concerns things the federal government has the right to do, this is not an issue of the states.  If you take the Hamiltonian viewpoint, however, it becomes an issue of basically unlimited federal power, and the states would be *very* interested in that.

>  Obviously the states never had the power to spend federal funds, so giving the federal government more power to spend isn't taking that power from the states.

If the federal government lacks the power to, say, build a bank, and it's a state rule, giving the power of bankmaking to the federal government results in a weakening of that state power, both in real weight and in impact.  It's why the supremacy clause exists and that states can't do federal things for the same reason.

> Well I'm convinced by Hamilton's argument more. And so was most of Congress, so it's not outta nowhere.

It does if you separate spending and regulation. Regulatory powers are mutually exclusive between the federal government and the states. Spending powers aren't.

>If you take the Hamiltonian viewpoint, however, it becomes an issue of basically unlimited federal power

The power isn't unlimited. It's severely curtailed by two restrictions: a. It has to be the general welfare (that is, not to the benefit of a specific state) and b. It has to be spending rather than regulation (ie, using money in ways that any rich person could without using the force of law to change behavior.)

Well yeah, but those are powers that any rich person or company could use as well, and the US was limited in what it could do by the finances of the time. What's more pertinent in a constitution is the power of the state to use legal authority over private citizens. Their power to *regulate* was still very limited by the enumerated powers.

If the states didn't think the bank was Constitutional when they ratified the Constitution they wouldn't have immediately appointed Senators who voted for it.

I apologize; my phrasing was poor. My point is that any arguments and reassurances about how the words were to be interpreted during ratification are not to be taken into consideration when interpreting the document. All clarification of the document must be in the document for it to be valid law. If a reasonable person at the time could argue for a certain interpretation (and if that interpretation were upheld by the Supreme Court, whose job it is to do this) I think that's pretty valid.

>You dislike the Articles of Confederation, but the one most pointed to is Letters From a Pennsylvania Farmer who basically uses the terminology in the same way in a pre-Revolutionary context.

This is fortunately untrue.  You dislike original intent, but authorial intent is taken into consideration by legal analysts of all ideological stripes.  You sidestepped the Obamacare question, but much of that ruling, for example, was based entirely in that, and part of the reason we see laws with what amount to glossaries in them is to further help surmise intent in possible litigation.

If someone says ""hm, I wonder what general welfare means in this context,"" it's absolutely appropriate to go to the source, not just shrug and hope you get it right.  It's like when we look at the second amendment.  ""Clear english"" in 2015 says ""well-regulated"" means effectively overseen by the government.  When the amendment was ratified, it meant something along the lines of well-maintained.  Doesn't authorial intent matter there?

> If a reasonable person at the time could argue for a certain interpretation (and if that interpretation were upheld by the Supreme Court, whose job it is to do this) I think that's pretty valid.

Why should it?  The general welfare clause covers it by virtue of being a reference to the powers in the section.

Not in practice. Lighthouses, national banks, federal college funding...the Supreme Court let the Federal government get away with a lot of this without question. I consider that the default.

The fact that Madison's view was never taken seriously by the US government is evidence that the Constitution's words were not decisively in Madison's favor from that time. Washington and Hamilton certainly didn't believe him, Jefferson had kind of his own idea, and even Madison himself caved under political pressure.

Then you're cherry-picking your history.  The 1800 election in particular is widely viewed as a repudiation of this overreach, and we didn't see it become standard until, unsurprisingly, the New Deal era.

For a ""default,"" that's a long time.

This is also ahistorical.  It was widely viewed as the serious take, it was Hamilton who lead the charge in the other direction and got the ear of a couple people in power.  That was largely (not completely) abandoned.

That doesn't matter. The taxing and spending clause concerns a separate power than the regulations mentioned afterwards.

Even before judicial review Congress passed it. And even after judicial review they didn't do it.

Because the way these people acted afterwards shows clear intent that the words in the Constitution didn't mean that.

That's just wrong. The federal government funded tons of programs that weren't under the enumerated powers well before the New Deal happened, and neither the Supreme Court nor Congress raised any question of constitutionality. Not just the lighthouses, but land-grant colleges, railways, homesteads, national parks...the current attitude towards the Congressional power of spending survived the Jefferson era and well predated the New Deal.

>It was widely viewed as the serious take, it was Hamilton who lead the charge in the other direction and got the ear of a couple people in power.

It's not Congress's job to do so, and the Supreme Court can only deal with what's put in front of them, and they shot down general welfare cases like this regularly.

No. I would expect it to be struck down too. The last time it was used was back in the 40s, and seeing as that was during the Roosevelt court that allowed the Korematsu decision, constitutionality was probably not on the table.

That was regulation of commerce--ie, an exclusively state power, rather than just a spending power.

I'm not sure how that's any less constitutional than what we have now. We already have public spending on education and healthcare. Maybe if it came with banning private universities or healthcare it would be but I don't think he's proposing that.

So, thanks?",2,0,1443107979,1444724716

I'm literally the farthest left you can go and have no problem with the moderators or this sub.  You complain because you act irrationally and want to soapbox your views instead of having a genuine discussion.

Naive, thats what you are",2,0,1443133741,1444724716
cvctc75,0,t1_cvcmg9n,zoidberg1339,"It's just a big ideological shift to make. If someone said they were from being a Neo-Nazi to donating to the NAACP and being a staunch liberal, I'd be skeptical.

Also, there's been a lot of ""my really conservative friend is now a Sanders supporter"" comments and posts in this subreddit in recent months and it just doesn't seem likely. As someone that went through a pretty major ideological shift over the period of a few years, the idea of someone going from a libertarian to a Sanders supporter just within this electoral cycle seems pretty implausible. It took me over a year to go from calling myself a liberal to a ""liberal with some libertarian sympathies"", and then another year to call myself a ""liberal-tarian"". And that was in college, a time when people tend to go through fairly rapid changes in mindset. I know that not everyone is the same as me, but ""right-libertarian to social democrat"" in 6-8 months is pretty drastic, even for a college student.",1,0,1443117971,1444724716

Whatevs. I've spent the past decade migrating on social issues and a bit less time on economic issues, but that's been primarily been because of my own economic issues. I converted out of Christianity after 25 years over the course of a weekend. It was very weird.

I don't consider myself a Democrat or a socialist, but the things he supports - as well as his character - make me like him, so I ask because I want to know more, not to troll.",2,0,1443118567,1444724716

There are a lot of serious Sanders supporters on reddit. It isn't a massive stretch to think that a few of them might fudge a post or two in hopes of enticing a libertarian or two to the Sanders side.",1,0,1443118774,1444724716
