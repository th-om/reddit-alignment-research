cv1xdyo,1,t3_3kxvtg,Nonsanguinity,"Here's how I see it.

The size of government is secondary to how corrupt it is. 

And how corrupt it is is a function of whether labor or capital has a monopoly on political influence. Only when the two are in balance can we address the much needed reforms our country needs to make.

This is because when labor and capital (In instances when their interests are adverse) are able to largely force a draw, neither side can gain a major advantage. Each side wins some skirmishes, but ultimately neither side fully conquers and subjugates the other.

And, in 21st century America, we have a system of capital that, while not a *total* monopoly on government power, is flying much too close to the sun for comfort. As a result, the set of assumptions that reinforces capitals narrative worldview is taken as gospel, and economic concerns trump individual or social concerns.

Sanders essentially wants a course correction by advocating for a return to equilibrium, where labor and capital negotiate and cooperate on an equal footing.

So, if he were to go *beyond* that, where labor, leveraging the power of government to make the capitalists miserable in the same way the capitalists are currently doing for some Americans, I would stop supporting him. The whole point in seeking equilibrium is to *avoid* instability and violence and misery.

cv2uhi5,0,t1_cv1ts5n,Braver_Incident,"POk, so I know what you are saying and I'll correct it now.  Communism can CORRECTLY mean 2 things: the hypothetical future stage of society where there is no state, no class, and no money, and then a reference to a movement towards that society, including ideologically.

Socialism is an economic system, a mode of production.  In the Marxist analysis that also posits a communist society, a socialist society is one that is in a transition stage from capitalism to communism.

A Communist is a socialist, but a socialist isn't always a Communist.  To be a Communist is to be someone who accepts the idea of communism and thinks it is something to be achieved.  Communists don't always support the USSR.  Many anarchists (and anarchists are socialists too) are Communists.  People who self described as democratic socialists also had Communist ties. In other words, you don't even have to accept the Marxist system of analysis to be a Communist, even more, the idea of communism existed before Marx was born.

What I am pretty sure you are referring to as Communist is the USSR.  The USSR, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was an ML socialist society. (ML socialism, short for Marxist-Leninist socialism, is one of the many many socialist ideologies out there) Was the USSR a communist state?  That is an oxymoron, no.  But they were run by Communists, and thus they were working towards a future where the entire world would live in communism, no state no money no class system.

So the USSR was ""communist"" in that it publicly accepted the idea and were working towards it, but as a description of the government, economy, and societal organization, they were socialist. (Actually this is in dispute, some argue that when Stalin took power, the USSR became a Degenerated Workers State, or state capitalist)


Now that I think about it, Communism would be a little more left, not significantly, but yes.  The fact it is an idea that works towards the most truest most utopian society that embodies all goals of the left would make Communists the farthest left.  But other than that, a Communist and a non Communist are pretty similar



I'm also guessing if you were confused on Communism, which most people are so it's not a big deal, you probably are the same on socialism.  FYI, Bernie doesn't actually advocate anything socialist in his campaign. The closest thing is worker cooperatives., but he advocates that under a still capitalist system.  Bernie would be better described as a social democrat",1,0,1442354859,1444728920
