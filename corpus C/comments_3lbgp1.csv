The calculator I used would place a household of 2 earning only 80k at 53%, more conservative than your 69th.

All filers appears to be an average of single and married (94 + 53) / 2 == 73.5, which matches the 'all filers' value for that calculator.

Maybe this is a great exercise as to how to mislead with statistics :)

However, I still stand by the number (although again, 94 seems really pretty high) or at very least the assertion that liberal tax reform would increase the tax liability of a single earner pulling about 80k.

Okay, but we're not talking median home owners.  We're talking about middle class people with homes they could realistically see the capital gains hit at.  Those are not unicorns.

My understanding based on my reading is that the 401k is tax-sheltered until it's removed.  

> Then could you provide a counter analysis? I just want to understand exactly why you think they don't add up.

The counter-analysis is the basic math.  We know how much health care costs, we know overhead is masked in government systems, and we know that there's nothing inherent about single payer/universal systems that create savings.  So we *must* assume that the costs will remain mostly the same absent any evidence that they won't be.  Simply saying ""overhead and profits"" doesn't fill that gap.

> Are you saying that this plan wouldn't reduce administrative overhead?

Of course it wouldn't.  Overhead doesn't just disappear because the government runs the program.",1,0,1442592745,1444727396

I'm not so sure. Imagine we see a growth of 50% in median home value over the next 10 years. That would be rediculously unprecedented, by the way, the largest growth we've seen in the market in US history. But still, let's imagine that we do, somehow, see insane growth rates. Even at 50% growth, the original value of the house would have to be over $500,000. Just the minimum possible down payment on a house that expensive would cost over twice the median pretax income, but realistically probably more like 3 or 4 times. The middle class does not buy half million dollar houses, and even if they did, there's less than a sliver of a chance that they'd have to pay any capital gains on a sale.

> My understanding based on my reading is that the 401k is tax-sheltered until it's removed.

Correct, though that's an income tax event, not a capital gains tax, and it occurs regardless of when withdrawal occurs. (Unlike a Roth IRA)

> we know overhead is masked in government systems

I was not aware. Could you provide the portion of Medicare overhead that's masked, and the mechanism through which this occurs?

> Of course it wouldn't. Overhead doesn't just disappear because the government runs the program.

Sure it does. Why would medicare need an advertising budget? Why would medicare spend as much investigating claims if all expenses are covered? Why would medicare spend as much processing enrollment if everyone is automatically enrolled?",1,0,1442595094,1444727396

So, to be clear, you don't think a family making $75,000 a year could afford a $500,000 house under current interest rates?

For example, tax collection.

To inform people of the program, their rights, their ability to use it, and so on.

To combat fraud, to ensure compliance, to police against misuse/overuse...

Because now you have to enroll *everyone* and process *everyone*.

A *family* making $75,000 would need to purchase a $1,000,000 home in order to to trigger a capital gains tax event. The exemption covers up to $500,000 for families. The $250,000 number is for individuals.

> For example, tax collection.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Medicare does not collect taxes, the IRS does. And expenses paid for by taxes (or whatever source of income) are accounted for by this projection.

> To inform people of the program, their rights, their ability to use it, and so on.

Why would they need an advertising budget to do this? Medicare already exists, why doesn't it currently need an advertising budget?

> To combat fraud, to ensure compliance, to police against misuse/overuse...

But if you're covering all claims, why would you need to spend as much money doing this as an organization that investigates *all* claims? Medicare already exists and spends less on claims per capita than private insurers. Why would the cost per capita increase if medicare were expanded?

> Because now you have to enroll everyone and process everyone.

We already do this... it's just done by private organizations who scrutinize each applicant. Why would it cost *more* to do this if the insurer accepted all applicants?

Second, it seems that the plan itself is saving money we already don't have, so its not necessarily going to be able to pay for anything.

Then, as we saw with the switzerland experiment in taxing the stock market, That won't actually get much revenue, all while we are still heavily, heavily in debt.

And this all hinges on him actually getting single payer healthcare passed, which I think is nigh impossible in the near future political climate.

So, overall you believe his plan is to shuffle debt from one source to another to pay for his plans all while his entire platform hangs on getting a new healthcare bill passed that is almost impossible to pass?
