3miy0n,A testament to the lack of discussion on policy at this stage of the election.,17,AMatterofTrust,"It seems that whenever Hilary Clinton, Jeb Bush, or Marco Rubio propose a policy proposal, it immediately gets drowned out by the endless coverage of on the democrats side Hillary's email scandal (which yes is an issue but there is no reason to invent multiple variations of the same story. She used a private server. She lied multiple times about the state of that server. That is bad. We get it) and on Donald Trump. Which is sad because the only one really focusing their attention on writing policy proposals is Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Hilary Clinton, and for people who won't win the election Bernie Sanders and Chris Christie. 

For Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio this is not much of an issue, once Trump falls, like he is expected to, they will make clear their already released and soon to be released policy positions. It is just that it is annoying that it is not happening now. On the democrats  side is another story. Hilary Clinton has made some progress sharing policy proposals (her climate change one for example) but otherwise all the media coverage on the left is focused on the scandal, drowning out everything else. And unlike Donald Trump, it won't go away. I mean her policy positions are not exactly bad (many on r/SandersForPresident should note that yes, she is actually more than all the scandals, and has well developed policy plans, probably moreso than Sanders) and while I favor the republican proposals after reading summaries of them, they are worthy of discussion. For Hilary Clinton, we are not having one, and because she will win, I feel that we will continue to be plagued by stories of the email thing, and never get to the policies until the general. 

And I find that, yes, while it is far out from the election, the discussion of the policies of *the likely democratic front-runner* is a discussion worth having, especially since there exists a far greater discussion on Sanders, who won't win. And the same is true for Rubio, Bush, and at one point Walker. But the news does not want to have that discussion, and it seems neither do we. 

And in the end, Hillary's email scandal, even if it was absolutely terrible, matters very little if the policies are never reported on. And a discussion of insiders and outsiders on the republican side is wholly irrelevant, policy and experience matter most. Why preferential coverage is given those without experience because they have no experience is beyond me. I am not saying the news should stop covering the scandal, it is a legitimate concern, but it would be good if they focus on policy at least as much as they do the scandal.
