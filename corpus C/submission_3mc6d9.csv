3mc6d9,Just saw a series of NH polls. One showing Bernie up over Clinton in net favor-ability by 23%. Another showing a tie between the two when asked who will win the NH primary. And the last one saying Clinton up 51 to 19 when who will win the general. What does this mean?,53,IrwinMFletcher,"I think it means that people love him in NH, but are not sure at this point that he has enough national recognition to pull off a win in the general. I believe the national debates will change that perception.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mc6d9/just_saw_a_series_of_nh_polls_one_showing_bernie/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443190604,1444723720
