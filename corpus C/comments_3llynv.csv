Social policy is merely an aspect of government. The welfare state (as Westerners have come to perceive it) has its roots in conservatism and the more pragmatic versions of liberalism.

In your case, certainly, a government policy favored you.  I'm more referring to in general with respect to the Welfare State.  Families *tend* to hold people up out of poverty.  The Brookings Institute found that people need to do three things to not be impoverished.

1.  Graduate High School.
2.  Hold a Full Time Job.
3.  Marry before having children.
