If Kim Davis personally refuses to issue them, but allows her deputy clerks to issue them, then it is a non-issue in my opinion. Her office is still issuing licenses, even if she personally doesn't want to. I may think she's a bigoted idiot, but as long as she is not interfering with someone's constitutional rights, then whatever.",14,0,1442265414,1444728868

props to the gay rights movement for toning it down when this became the case. Otherwise they would just look vindictive.",6,0,1442275479,1444728868
cv228zx,0,t1_cv1r8bt,kingvitaman,"There will be a lot of suing going around regardless. EMI and Survivor are suing Mike Huckabee and event organizors for unlawfully using their music. Kim Davis is suing the KY govenor. Then there's the issue that the licenses issued are separate but equal and may not pass legal scrutiny ( remember Davis said any licenses issued in her absence are invalid ). The ACLU is bringing a case against Rowan county because of this. 

We won't hear the last of Davis until November 08 2016.

Basically, as long as you can still get your license, the state is not discriminating against you. She (like all employees, in both the public or private sectors) is legally allowed to refuse to perform a task not in keeping with her beliefs so long as it does not create ""undue hardship"" for the government (her employer), the citizens involved, or her colleagues.",4,0,1442256972,1444728868

Lets say you go into McDonalds and order a burger. You get the manager at the cash register, and once he sees that you're black, he asks you to go to another line. You still get your burger, but were treated differently because of your skin color.  The question will be if this initial refusal of service is enough to bring a discrimination case from. And you wouldn't sue the manager, if you were smart, you'd sue the corporation for employing this person. ",4,0,1442296090,1444728868
