3m79ep,"As a long-time conservative/Libertarian turned Sanders supporter, how do American socialists reconcile their political positions with the US Constitution?",112,NtheLegend,"The United States Constitution calls for a limited federal power with some elasticity. This makes sense because the founders had just spent a number of years fighting for independence from a strong, overseas federal power. It's what makes the second amendment so divisive: we fear a totalitarian government that would run our lives, but many of us don't worry about the US Republic becoming totalitarian quite as much these days.

But the Constitution - as strong and flexible as it is - has caused some issues. We can no longer be a mere confederation of states in the 21st century. Jefferson had to deal with wanting a limited federal power, but also the issues of the multi-jurisdictional National Road (infrastructure) and building and maintaining a federal military force to protect American trade interests in Barbary waters, something that even modern libertarians would probably be best handled by private-sector bounty hunters or what have you.

This sentiment also spurred the Civil War, in which the Confederacy took Jefferson's words and ideas to heart and split from the nation when they believed the federal government was ineffective and unaligned with their values. Modern, fringe domestic terrorists use the Constitution to justify crimes against government employees as they consider them to be agents of an ever-enlarging, tyrannical entity.

So let's set aside the 20th century's creation of America's socialist programs -- and the fact that conservatives have had many, many opportunities to dismantle them and never seemed interested in doing so -- how does one reconcile the growing interest in placing more wealth and power in a federal government to expand its role in reducing wealth inequality and increase quality of life for everyone against a master document written to limit these initiatives (perhaps ironically, assembled by a number of wealthy individuals) by placing the burden of welfare on the individual, rather than the nation?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3m79ep/as_a_longtime_conservativelibertarian_turned/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443104140,1444724694
