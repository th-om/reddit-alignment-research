3lqo0a,Should we sacrifice growth for equality?,96,AnthemIcarus,"A while back Bernie Sanders said this:

>""where we've got to move is not growth for the sake of growth but ... to a society that provides a high quality of life for all of our people,""


Sanders has said he is willing to sacrifice growth in the economy simply for the sake of improving the lives of people here and now.

My question is: on a macro scale, should we be more concerned with growth or with providing the best life for people here and now?

For example, the United States has large swaths of inequality, yet lead the world in innovation and new technology in many fields. 
So would it be better to go ahead full steam with the best economic system to innovate and develop so that eventually we would have new technology that would improve our lives long term more immediately, or would it be better to delay having that technology for a decade or two in order to redirect resources to helping the worse off?

Or can Nordic style mixed economies (socialism) innovate just as well as American style capitalism?",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lqo0a/should_we_sacrifice_growth_for_equality/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442794146,1444726289
