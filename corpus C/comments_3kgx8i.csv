New Mexico is purple, as it was for 2000, 2004, and early in 2008; New Mexico has a Republican Governor and Hillary Clinton is no Barrack Obama. Then there is Colorado, Nevada, Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio as other swing states. ",2,0,1441942218,1444730326

cuxz44w,0,t1_cuxrm83,lightmonkey,"Hillary isn't really a New Yorker, she parachuted for the Senate seat. Also in the general both candidates have universal name recognition, that advantage goes away after the primary. Pennsylvania in 2012 was a 5% margin, 2008 was polling within the margin of error until the recession began, 2004 was won by 2%, and 2000 was won by 4%; so I wouldn't say safely Democrat. Clinton herself has been losing in head to head polls for the state, including 47-40 against Rubio; it may be early but Pennsylvania will be in play to some degree for many of the potential nominees.

cuyze31,1,t3_3kgx8i,molotoviphone,"Hillary 

Pros: Electability, civil rights support, experience, foreign skills

Cons: distasteful track record, recent flip-flopping, insincerity

Bernie

Pros: steadfast in beliefs, morally correct, bulletproof track record 

Cons: electability, uncompromising, economic reality 

I'm in the Bernie camp, if you didn't know. We usually get a lot of backlash from this particular sub for supporting him, despite the overall attitude of reddit. 

Hillary is pandering for my vote. I have heard her positions, and how they disagree with previous positions of hers. I feel she is insincere when she comes out in support of transgendered people/the general LGBT community after talking of how marriage was a bond between man and woman, not just two people, in 2004. 

She has also called her vote for the Iraq war ""a mistake."" In her book, she said she ""got it wrong."" 

Did you bubble in the wrong bubble on the sheet? Did you forget your glasses and circle Y instead of N? 

No. Hillary consciously made the decision to vote for something that has had a negative effect on our country. 

And yes, Bernie's economic policies are unsound, but not for many of the reasons people here seem to think. If his policies succeeded in full, the economy would remain the same or improve. However, Bernie will find no support in the house or the senate for reallocating funds from the rich to the poor. ",1,0,1442067721,1444730326

How dare she make a mistake, and then own up to it??? Like, it's almost human nature to screw up at some point, especially after a time such as 9/11??

Also, remember the both Hillary and Bernie voted for Afghanistan.",1,0,1442110858,1444730326
cuzr8hd,0,t1_cuzmmld,molotoviphone,"It's the timing 

She rolls with popular opinion. Her vote did not become a mistake until the American public began to dislike the decision made, and she transitioned with them. She is pandering to the democrat left and the moderates to win the presidency, but I have yet to see her try to achieve a goal or set of goals. ",1,0,1442120991,1444730326
