Brain drain. I picture a snake biting its tail. The Kansas economy needs employers to move deeper west into the state and create non-seasonal, equitable wage jobs with career potential for advancement, family-building and settlement. Employers wonder how they will attract and cultivate strong talent to an isolated location with some of the nation's lowest paid teachers, highest consumption taxes, and [2015 personal income tax rates higher than California wage earners with similar income levels and filing status](http://taxfoundation.org/article/state-individual-income-tax-rates-and-brackets-2015) in exchange for negligible-to-negative cultural ROI.

Edit: No insults intended. Kansas has more than 34,000, unfilled, mostly low-paying jobs, and whether you make $15k annually or $150,000k annually you'll pay just 4.6% income tax. So, if you're a doctor who makes $250,000 annually from your LLC you pay zero taxes. So? Shame on us. Our taxes on food are just plain shameful. I'd pay 50% income taxes if it would afford our kids great educations, advanced training and employment near their families that offers them a full 40-hours per week and the hope they might just have a chance here and not have to become a truck driver or go work for the marijuana industry in Colorado.

cvhblun,1,t3_3mqguc,ABSOLUTELY__BASED,"Kansan here, I'll do my best to give a tl;dr of the past couple of years.

Governor Brownback's and many Republicans in the state legislature's ultimate goal here is to make Kansas a zero-income tax state like Texas, Nevada, Florida, and I think one of the Dakotas. Because it's highly unreasonable to make that sort of change a flip of a switch type of deal, there's been a push lately to lower income taxes across the board. IIRC, the income tax cuts first took into effect 1.5 or 2 years ago.

Now here's where things get a bit partisan and fuzzy.

Kansas Democrats didn't much like the income tax cuts, in part because tax receipts for the state came in something like 1-3% below predicted values. On paper that worked out to around to a few hundred million. On top of that, a (in my estimation) activist judge ruled that the state's new funding formula for schools put many rural schools at a funding disadvantage, and by court order decreed that school spending had to go up in those areas, costing the state another $300 million or so, based off of a number produced by some state bureau that deals with this sort of thing. I mentioned earlier that it gets partisan here, because just a few months before the funding formula was changed, this same bureau came out with a number of required funds; and had they stuck with that same number everything would have been alright. But almost immediately after publishing the initial figure, they bumped up that price of required dollars that these schools needed, essentially throwing a bomb on the budgetary process at the very last possible moment.

Overall, the state faced a $600 million deficit. Queue back and forth bickering in the legislature and media about Brownback wanting schools shut down, and how the state's economy is a mess because of the deficit and yadda yadda.

In the end, the legislature passed an increase to the state sales tax of (I think) somewhere less than 1% and also bumped up the tax on smokes, and now everyone is upset. Democrats because the income tax rates were lowered, Republicans because other taxes were raised.

To sum up, the state economy is doing fine. We've maintained really good unemployment figures throughout the recession, and that's one of the reasons why certain media sources throw out the claim that 'oh well Kansas isn't recovering as fast as our neighboring states!' and they point to the delta in unemployment. Well the problem with that is when you're relatively close to full employment, OF COURSE you're not gonna have huge dips in the unemployment rate.

I think this upcoming year's economic output and tax receipts are going to do rather well. We're heavy on aviation and agriculture in the state, and both of those industries have had pretty good years in late 2014-2015.

That's all I can remember off the top of my head now. Let me know if you'd like me to get into any more specifics or anything.",44,0,1443473855,1444722677

EDIT- Just realized this article is behind a paywall. Here is the text, if anyone is wondering:

>Four years ago North Carolina’s unemployment rate was above 10% and the state still bore the effects of its battering in the recession. Many rural towns faced jobless rates of more than 20%. But in 2013 a combination of the biggest tax-rate reductions in the state’s history and a gutsy but controversial unemployment-insurance reform supercharged the state’s economy and has even helped finance budget surpluses.

>As Wells Fargo’s Economics Group recently put it: “North Carolina’s economy has shifted into high gear. Hiring has picked up across nearly every industry.”

>The tax cut slashed the state’s top personal income-tax rate to 5.75%, near the regional average, from 7.75%, which had been the highest in the South. The corporate tax rate was cut to 5% from 6.9%. The estate tax was eliminated.

>Next came the novel tough-love unemployment-insurance reforms. The state became the first in the nation to reject “free” federal payments for extended unemployment benefits and reduce the weeks of benefits to 20 from 26. The maximum weekly dollar amount of payments, $535, which had been among the highest in the nation, was trimmed to a maximum of $350 a week. As a result, tens of thousands of Carolinians left the unemployment rolls.

>Committee to Unleash Prosperity Co-founder Steve Moore on the return of the Republican Party's 'Pat Buchanan' wing. Photo credit: Getty Images.
In an interview at the governor’s mansion, Gov. Pat McCrory tells me that when he took office in January 2013 he looked at the data and knew “we couldn’t stay on the course we were on. We had the highest unemployment benefits and yet at the same time businesses were routinely complaining they couldn’t find workers until benefits ran out. We heard a lot of stories of workers waiting until benefits ran out before going back to work.” In sum, the state was paying people not to work.

>While these measures were passing the legislature, the state capital boiled over with rancorous political rallies, called Moral Mondays, designed to block the “cruel” GOP agenda. Rev. William Barber II, one of the protest organizers, lambasted Republicans for making the Tar Heel State a “crucible of extremism and injustice.” The national media piled on with claims that the Republican agenda cut taxes for the rich while slashing benefits for the poor.

>Then a funny thing happened. After a few months, the unemployment rate started to decline rapidly and job growth climbed. Not just a little. Nearly 200,000 jobs have been added since 2013 and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5% from 7.9%. There is a debate about how many of North Carolina’s unemployed got jobs and how many dropped out of the workforce or moved to another state. But the job market is vastly improved and people didn’t go hungry in the streets. On the Tax Foundation index of business conditions, North Carolina has been catapulted to 16th from a dismal 44th since 2013.

>The most recent news will make many other governors jealous. The state didn’t take the extra federal benefits—which require repayments later to the feds—and it cut the weekly benefits. So the state government has been able to pay back $2.8 billion in unemployment-insurance money owed to the feds, and it now has a trust-fund surplus. This means it will be able to provide employers with at least $500 million in cuts from the state and federal unemployment tax on payroll over 18 months.

>This comes at a time when other states are having to raise payroll taxes to pay off the loans for the rich benefits they doled out in the recession and its aftermath. The lesson: Handouts from the feds are never free.

>An even bigger surprise—even to supporters—is the tax cut’s impact on revenue. Even with lower rates, tax revenues are up about 6% this year according to the state budget office. On May 6, Gov. McCrory announced that the state has a budget surplus of $400 million while many other states are scrambling to fill gaps.

>This is the opposite of what has happened in Kansas, where jobs have been created but revenues have fallen since the top personal income-tax rate was cut from 6.45% in 2012 to 4.6% today and the income tax for small business owners who file as individuals has been eliminated. North Carolina’s former budget director, Art Pope, says one difference between the two states is that “we cut spending too. Kansas didn’t.”

>The story gets better. Because North Carolina built in a trigger mechanism that applies excess revenues to corporate-rate cuts, the business tax has fallen to 5% from 6.9%, and next year it drops to 4%.

>You won’t hear much about this in national news media, where the preferred story line is that tax cuts don’t work because they were followed by budget deficits in Kansas. In North Carolina, policies to reduce taxes and stop paying people for not working have created jobs and surpluses.
