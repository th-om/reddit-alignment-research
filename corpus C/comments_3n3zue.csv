cvkkpu9,1,t3_3n3zue,brunnock,"Has any government official or employee ever gone to jail simply because they had secret info on a private email server?

Edit-

*If some lower-level federal employee would have done this, they would be in jail now. Why is Hillary Clinton any different?*

I've waited for responses and did a little research. To answer your question, Hillary is no different. The fact is no one has ever gone to jail simply for storing secrets improperly.

The 2 closest parallels I can find are the cases of John Deutch and Alberto Gonzales.

Deutch was the DCI from 1995-96 and was found to have stored secrets on insecure laptops. He was pardoned by Bill Clinton on his last day in office.

As Attorney General, Gonzales kept secrets in an unlocked briefcase and at home. The DoJ declined to press charges.

In her case, [we know for a fact that satellite intelligence (likely imagery)](http://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/judiciary/upload/Classified%20docs,%2008-11-15,%20ICIG%20CN%20-%20Update%20on%20Classified%20Materials%20on%20Personal%20thumb%20drive.%20Clinton%20server.pdf) (which is by definition classified Top Secret) was stored on her unsecured private server. This constitutes mishandling of classified information, which is a serious offense. 

I do not understand why there's any question at all about whether or not she broke the law at this point. There's no excuse for what she did, she can't say she didn't know, and even if she were rendered so incapacitated by mental deficit as to not know, there's no mens rea requirement, the fact that such documents were mishandled is sufficient for a violation to have occurred.

what could she have done differently?

also, from the NYT article from the breitbart article above:

> “Classification is rarely a black and white question, and it is common for the State Department to engage internally and with our interagency partners to arrive at the appropriate decision,” he said in a statement. “Very often both the State Department and the intelligence community acquire information on the same matter through separate channels. Thus, there can be two or more separate reports and not all of them based on classified means. At this time, any conclusion about the classification of the documents in question would be premature.”",11,0,1443714713,1444721039
cvknglz,0,t1_cvkleoo,Quetzalcoatls,"Yes, her having her own server is not an issue legally. Her legal issues stem from her failure to properly store the data she received.

No, it was not secure in the slightest. There are a whole host a rules that you have to comply with when your dealing with classified information, in some instances even having to store the server physically in purpose built room. IIRC she just had it stored in a closet, using basic run of the mill software to secure it. Nothing that was adequate to store the kind of information she was receiving. I've heard that it could almost be considered  professional incompetence on the part of foreign intelligence officials if they were unable to break her security and get into the server. 

Clinton could have not used her own server and allowed the State Department handle everything. She would have avoided the entire scandal that way. That or she could have paid someone to set up & maintain a compliant system, though that would be a recurring cost for her as long as she was in a position to get information like that. 

Information she is know to have on that server is ""born classified"", meaning it is classified from the moment it comes into existence. While that quote may explain Clinton's behavior in some instances, it in no way legally absolves her of the responsibility to properly store the information she received. As SoS she would be made aware of what information would be born classified and not appropriate to discuss on unsecured channels anyway, leaving her no excuse in those instances.
