cv5v75q,1,t3_3ldlhx,balorina,"1) The left is calling the WSJ a hit-piece because it didn't paint the whole picture.  The picture they were painting wasn't ""The full picture of Bernie's proposal"" it was ""The total cost of Bernie's proposals"".  They didn't in any instance come up with methods of payment because Bernie himself has yet to say how he's going to pay for anything.  He's hinted at things, but those things he's hinted at don't pass the smell test.

2)  The numbers Friedman gave were based on Medicare enrollee numbers which is ~$10k/person.  The US gov't currently has three healthcare systems it runs, Medicaid runs at $13k/enrollee and the VA system is a supplimentary system.  When adjusting for cost (VA only pays 30-40% usually) the VA costs ~12.5k/enrollee. Why did they choose the low number from Medicare, rather than the high number from Medicaid?

3)  They are assuming you can do an equitable shift, ie ""private insurance pays $5 so the gov't will pay $5"".  This isn't always true, in many things the layers of gov't added lead to inefficiencies while on the private side those layers are profit and marketing.  Medicaid for all could very likely ""F35"" us, or come out cheaper.

4)  There hasn't been a single mention on what they're going to do with the displacement of the 400-500k people who currently directly work in the healthcare insurance field.  This also doesn't take into account those who indirectly benefit from it, such as cleaners who contract to clean their offices and luxury places such as bars and restaurants who opened up near their larger locations.  When a GM plant shuts down, for example, it leaves a massive blot in the area as not only the plant shuts down but also the businesses who relied on it.

5)  As I said, the numbers Bernie has given don't pass the smell test.  He has proposed the ""Robin Hood"" financial transaction tax to pay for free education for all.  [The problem is the amount he gave gives the system $60b when the US system currently costs $28t](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/05/29/1388484/-Bernie-Sanders-big-idea-has-a-math-problem).  Even getting rid of pell grants and other federal sources of aid (they aren't useful anymore) you still reach a fraction of the cost.  This also ignores that the financial transaction tax in countries with major markets (not countries like Peru or Poland) such as Japan who removed it, Sweden where it's considered a failure, Switzerland where it is also considered a failure (it only applies to local brokers so people just use foreign ones)",6,0,1442586218,1444727302
cv5kwj7,1,t3_3ldlhx,GaiusPompeius,"Well, here are my thoughts on Reich's response, coming from a skeptic.

1.) While it's possible that a perfectly engineered single-payer system could result in lower healthcare costs, the savings (if there are any) are going to come from out-of-pocket expenses currently paid by individuals, not from the federal budget.  This means that more taxes across the board are needed to turn those personal savings into federal revenue.

(Plus, neither Reich's blog nor the article he links to specifically lay out where these extra savings are going to come from.  Does Medicare currently have lower administrative costs per capita than private health plans?  Because if not, I don't see how expanding Medicare is going to lower administrative costs.)

2.) See point #1.  These savings need to be real and need to translate into federal revenue before we start talking about how to spend the surplus.

3.) Once again, he is confusing private spending with federal spending.  If the government spends $1 on tuition and lowers my own tuition costs by $1, then the government still needs to raise an extra dollar of revenue to break even.  So taxes need to go up accordingly.  Plus, this doesn't even take into account the probability that more people will attend college if it's paid for.

4.) This just sounds like the broken windows fallacy: not all government spending pays for itself.  A trillion-dollar bridge in the middle of Death Valley will not pay for itself.  I need to see more specifics about what kind of infrastructure is going to be built and how it will produce revenue.

So all in all, this is a pretty flimsy counter-argument as far as I can see.  This isn't to say that Sanders' policies are unworkable, but Reich's only argument is just to forget about the details and trust that government spending will always reduce costs no mater what.",11,0,1442553637,1444727302

Not necessarily. If the government spends $1 on tuition and lowers your own tuition costs by $1, and you still spend that $1 on something else, and then the person who got that dollar spends it too, and so on... you don't get up to a dollar, but with the boost to the overall economy from additional spending, the government might only have to raise an additional $0.25 to break even.",2,0,1442583598,1444727310
cv64an3,0,t1_cv5tqq5,GaiusPompeius,"It is true that the Keynesian cross argument promises a multiplier effect from private consumption, so you're right there.  But if we're talking about keeping things deficit-neutral (after all, the WSJ's criticism was that spending was going to be higher than tax revenue), you have to consider the opportunity cost of that federal dollar: for the initial funding we're now spending one dollar less on something else, and presumably the multiplier argument can also be made for that other lost expenditure.",3,0,1442600243,1444727310
cv5itcv,1,t3_3ldlhx,Odnyc,"Reich is pointing out that some of these costs are real costs that we already pay. Everyone in the U.S. pays for health insurance, whether through an exchange, the private market, part of compensation, etc. 

In 2014, U.S. healthcare spending hit $3.8 Trillion, and is projected to grow. Medicare has proven to be an effective way of delivering care to a population that needs care more than the average American, more efficiently than insurers. Overhead for medicare is much lower than private insurers, as is the fraud rate. Rather than spending this chunk of money collectively on healthcare via private insurers, this money would be paid to the government, who would pay for care. Using the Journal's own calculations of $15 T/10yrs  on healthcare, and extrapolating from the $3.8 tril spend this year (38 Trillion) Bernie seems to be far ahead. Admittedly, these projections may not be terribly scientific, but still illustrate the concept of how the money is already being spent on the same things via a more inefficient, for profit conduit.

Edit: It's sort of unfair to describe Reich in the title as ""liberal commentator and author."" He was Clinton's Secretary of Labor during one of the longest economic growth periods in U.S. history, and a professor at UC Berkeley.
