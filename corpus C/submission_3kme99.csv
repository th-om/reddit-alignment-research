3kme99,"Why do republicans seem to strategically alienate people? If they toned it down their social conservativism, they would almost certainly increase and retain their votes.",30,DannyXopher,"Conservatives seem to intentionally go further to the right in their views than needed, and it leads to unnecessary alienation.  They could loosen up their social views - while still being more conservative than the liberals, of course - and get a lot more swing votes. They wouldn't lose their religious vote, because they would be just *barely* more religious. 

This is especially true if they want the younger vote. It's not necessarily easy to convince young people fiscal conservativism is the way to go, but it's becoming a cakewalk compared to convincing them being gay is wrong. 

Surely the politicians are not religious enough for this to actually be a factor. Don't they simply want to win the election? And don't they make careers around forming their views into what gets the most votes?
