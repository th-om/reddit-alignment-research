First question, what does this mean?  There isn't any single measure that defines the health of the economy.  If you frame this question a bit better, it may provide different answers.

For instance, is GDP your only measure?  Every immigrant would increase GDP, almost by definition, so you'd maximize GDP by letting in as many people as possible.  How about the unemployment rate?  Immigrants tend to help mitigate the effect of recessions and bring skills to areas that don't have them, so again you'd generally want lots of immigration for unemployment.

What about income?  Well, overall income, median income, or lower-class income?  George Borjas' work demonstrates that low-skill immigration increases income for native workers *in general*, but does hurt unskilled native wages.  So, is that trade-off worth it?",10,0,1442790866,1444726308

My personal opinion is that there should be no cap on immigrants, and anyone who wants to come here can, with visas being sold.
