3n9yjz,"Libertarians/Conservatives, please help me understand, why is gun regulation such a horrific idea?",337,HomelessPandas,"Obviously this post comes in the wake of the Oregon shooting. I know that this sub is full of libertarians, so please help me understand, why do you/people who share your political tendencies, get so fucking vitriolic, hateful and stubborn on this issue? I've already seen so much of this type of idiocy and it hasn't' even been 48 hours. I grew up 10 minutes away from Columbine High school, and I know people who were involved in the shootings, so this is one of very few issues in which I'm emotionally invested.

***I myself and a gun owner, and I have no problem jumping through extra hoops/training/screening to own my firearms. If it keeps guns out of the wrong hands once, it's worth it.*** 

Nobody is going to take our guns away, if that were the case,  I would be with you. Why is it such an atrocity for the government to try and prevent things like this from happening? People will always say that mental health (guns don't kill people, people kill people) is the true issue at hand, but those are almost always the same people who support small government, which has been forced to drastically cut mental health funding in the past decades. Wtf?

 Is your answer honestly the cliche ""An armed society is a polite society?"" and that somehow this society will breed some sense of egalitarian mutual respect? To me it just seems like some socially controlled Orwellian nightmare, everyone is terrified of doing anything to piss someone off. You may cite the Chicago handgun ban, and assume that it is dogmatically indicative of the colossal failure of gun control, but I don't buy that for a second.

What is your logic?",51,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3n9yjz/libertariansconservatives_please_help_me/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443822131,1444720169
