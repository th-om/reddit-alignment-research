I didn't say they accounted for all the costs, but they do represent a portion of the increase.

Regardless of it's de facto status, driving is still classified by law as a privilege whereas health insurance is now mandatory. Additionally, the one thing women used to be able to do to mitigate costs, opt out of maternity coverage, is no longer an option. Car insurance rates have far more options for mitigating costs, i.e. the type of car you drive, coverage limits, etc. Both of these things affect the perception of the fairness of cost disparity.

The question you need to answer is how much does the *government* suffer when men drive uninsured. The answer is probably ""not much"". Uninsured drivers generate revenues for the courts through fines and when an individual is hit by an uninsured driver, the government is not required to step in and cover the cost. When people need healthcare and they aren't insured, the government ends up paying more. Because pregnancy is *always* covered by medicaid, the government had a strong incentive to transfer those costs to private insurers and so minimizing disincentives for 50% of the population to purchase private insurance is a logical (though, again, not necessarily fair) idea.

Car insurance rates have far more options for mitigating costs, i.e. the type of car you drive, coverage limits, etc. Both of these things affect the perception of the fairness of cost disparity.

Which is irrelevant, because everything a man if a man did everything he could to get his car insurance as cheap as possible, a women doing the same would STILL get cheaper.

Does increased benefit to the government justify discrimination against a protected class? One could argue that marriage could be denied to gays under the basis of that marriage as provided as a benefit to in turn reward the government with well adjusted children. Since gays can't have children, the benefit can be witheld.

Furthermore I would definitely say that uninsured drivers cause damages and court fees that they typically can't pay. This is passed onto someone, sometimes the government. If I fall asleep driving and run into a lamp post, I've caused damages to the government. If I'm uninsured, I'm probably too poor to pay for the damages I've caused so there's a benefit to the government for having more men insured.

cuwd1ya,0,t1_cuwbhob,Freckled_daywalker,">I don't really get what you're arguing, here. I don't see a perceived benefit of discrimination a justification for said discrimination.

Charging men more for car insurance is legal because there's (almost always) no law against it. The 14th ammendment prohibits discrimination by the government but antidiscrimination laws that apply to private businesses are found in the Civil Rights act and apply to ""public accommodations"", which insurance doesn't fall under.  Car insurance is regulated at the state level and IIRC there are a few states that have anti gender discrimination laws on the books but by in large, it's just an issue most states don't feel strongly enough about to pass a law against, most likely because of the perception issues I've been pointing out. 

>I don't think that reasoning would stand in court. 

It has stood in court, in the sense that people have challenged gender discrimination in car insurance pricing and lost. The federal mandate to normalize health insurance pricing is an extra legal protection likely due to it's perceived benefit, not one that's required by antidiscrimination laws.

One could argue that marriage could be denied to gays under the basis of that marriage as provided as a benefit to in turn reward the government with well adjusted children.

Again, there's no legal basis for protection against gender based price discrimination in private insurance sales. Marriage is a government function and subject to a different standard.

Not really. I don't have hard numbers but I'd venture to guess that most damages caused by uninsured or under insured motorists are going to be eaten either by the individual they hit or by the damaged parties private insurance. Civil property damage is a cost to local governments, not the state governments who are making the laws, so the perceived benefit is going to be reduced. 

>Is there any case laws that shows this to be true?

Well, yeah. Like I said, the gender discrimination in auto insurance pricing has been challenged in the courts before and been found legal. Whether it's *fair* is certainly arguable but it's definitely legal provided there's no state law against it.  
 
So if you're asking *why* the disparity exists, it's because the federal government perceived a benefit to providing an *additional* benefit of normalized gender pricing, whereas states don't  (usually) perceive the same benefit for normalized gender pricing in car insurance.

Is it legal to price discriminate again gender if there's empirical evidence behind the price discrimination.

cuwewdw,0,t1_cuwdnx6,Freckled_daywalker,">If it wasn't there wouldn't that open ACA to be challenged indirectly as taxation based of gender? 

Probably not, because the while the insurance might cost mire, the ""tax"" would be gender neutral. 

>Would racial discrimination in car insurance be ok?

Most states have laws prohibiting this but thinking about it, it may be that their applying Title II to insurance companies but since Title II doesn't actually mention gender, it doesn't apply in this situation. I'd have to delve delve deeper into the law. 


>The ACA is a government function though.

It's regulation of a private industry, not a government function. Marriage (in the civil sense) is wholly administered by the government. 

>That's a bad argument, state money( and federal) goes to the local level all the time. 

If I'm a lawmaker in the state government, I don't deal with line item local costs like ""repairing the light pole that the uninsured driver hit"". If I'm cognizant of the local cost of upkeep and repair of civil property it's on the most general of terms, like ""Maintenence budget"". It's not that state money doesn't get used, it's that it's not such a big cost so it doesn't capture the notice or interest of the people who make state laws. On the flip side, over half of the pregnancies in the US are covered by Medicaid. It's a huge cost, so lawmakers have a strong incentive to take steps to transfer that cost. 


>I guess I understand. I think the law should treat the whole thing as a broader question:

>Is it legal to price discriminate again gender if there's empirical evidence behind the price discrimination. 

Is it legal? According to current precedent, yes. It's also legal to provide *extra* protection (such as price normalization) to achieve 
a desired goal. Whether it's fair or ethical is a different question. 

>This idea of parsing out into different markets is silly in my opinion, the idea behind it should be what focuses on.

Or, the people who wrote the law genuinely believe that there is a real benefit to be had from increasing the participation of women in the health care market by normalized price. Realistically it's probably a little of both. 

Edit: Just to add, health insurance and auto insurance are fundamentally different products. Car insurance is traditional insurance that protects against catastrophic damage whereas health insurance is more like a combination of traditional insurance and a prepaid vehicle maintenance and warranty plan. Parsing them into different categories is approriate, as laws that work well to regulate costs in one market (auto insurance) may not work the same way in the health insurance market.

Reproduction is a necessary part of a stable society.

Insurance amortizes risk over the long term. They are basing their premiums on risk over a specified amount of time, and 80% of women have children in their lifetime, the first being at an average age of 25.6.

They prioritize profit, but not always short term.

Also, since profit margins for those insurance companies are on average 4%, and the second most expensive healthcare per capita is Norway with a $2000-3000 difference, 4% doesn't come close to explaining it.

They could prioritize profit over overall population health because they could simply refuse to insure patients who they deemed too high risk, which left a significant portion of high risk patients in an incredibly vulnerable position and passed their costs on to the hospitals and the taxpayers.

Healthcare economics is a massively complex topic. As I've plainly stated, I'm not arguing that the ACA was the best solution to the problem, but it does appear to have slowed the spiral of costs which buys us some time to come up with a better plan.

Or that means it's unprofitable to insure them, which means insuring them is a loss, which threatens the solvency of the firm. This means fewer services for others, higher prices, or both.

They're not passing their costs on unless you think one restaurant is passing on their costs to another when they refuse to serve someone who won't pay their prices.

People respond to incentives in unpredictable ways. There's a growing economic field that addresses this issue because assumptions about behavior has led to some bad economic theory. There's empirical evidence that shows that things like providing no cost long term birth control lowers the rate of unplanned pregnancies and reduces overall costs by a significant amount. If you're gong to claim that providing disincentives for pregnancy is equally beneficial, you need to provide evidence that the benefit of such a policy is equal or greater.

That would be true if, like restaurants, hospitals were allowed to refuse service but they aren't. Not only are they required to provide care, the way the law is structured, it encourages people who can't afford to pay to access care through the ED. The costs don't go away, they get transferred and ultimately drive up costs, just not in a way that hurts the insurance company's bottom line. You could argue that hospitals shouldn't be required to provide care but that will never fly as public policy.  People are not okay with letting other people die in the streets because they can't afford care. Maybe you think they should be but that's not reality.

So, you're saying we should use empirical evidence not just ""if you make people responsible for pregnancies they won't have kids they can't afford"". Great, I agree. A significant number of health care economists agree that universal coverage of birth control is one of the easiest and among the more effective things we can do for lowering health care costs.

Again it's important to recognize that increased availability of X getting desired result Y speaks to the value of X, not any particular method of increasing it's availability. 

If you made birth control so inexpensive to manufacture essentially anyone could afford it, then you wouldn't need a universal healthcare program for it. The irony of course,is that by universalizing it, you've removed an incentive from its producers to reduces its costs, as now they won't gain any new customers from doing so.

Many forms of hormonal birth control are already ridiculously cheap. Long term birth control comes in two forms, IUDS and hormonal implants. The high cost of these isn't usually due to manufacturing, it's the professional fees to place them. Somebody still has to pay for the drugs and insurance companies are perfectly capable of negotiating with drug companies to provide lowered cost incentives.

Awesome. There are tons of studies on the effects of co-pays and out of pocket costs when it comes to prescription drug compliance, there are several regarding the effects of long term versus daily birth control methods and compliance rates and at least two on the effects of providing cost free long term contraception, one in relation to the effect on long term costs but the best place to start is probably the citation list for the IOM recommendations re: women's preventive care for DHHS.

>Appeals to humanity are rather ironic given a policy proposal of access via tax funded universal healthcare programs includes an entitlement to other people's labor, enforced with violence.

That's one way of looking at it. Another way is to say that pooled resources are often more effective than individuals and that we all benefit greatly from a healthy society and that there's a not insignificant chance that universally funded care might be cheaper for everyone in the long run. Ultimately, this is a much larger philisophical issue than even Healthcare as your argument could be applied to pretty much every public good.

The fact they don't always have sufficient information to know what they think will happen will happen doesn't mean they're irrational, but misinformed.

Mandatory contraceptive coverage, as a policy, has nothing to do with gender rating for insurance coverage because previously insurance companies weren't even required to offer policies that covered maternity costs. They were perfectly free to pass the cost on to the taxpayer. Mandatory contraception coverage is about saving the *goverment* money, since most unplanned pregnancies are covered by Medicaid. Now that insurance companies are required to cover pregnancy, they're all about covering birth control.  My insurance company sends me reminders now to make sure I get my BCP prescription renewed.

That's only by examining through that distorted lens though. Your cost/benefit analysis is based on not actually paying the full cost of that benefit, or paying more than the cost of the benefit, depending on which pool contributor you are.

>Behavioral economists disagree with you. People do not always behave rationally, especially with emotionally charged situations and even with perfect information, tend to not evaluate risks accurately. This is basic psychology.

Evaluating risks inaccurately isn't irrational, but a problem with information signaling. People's priorities changing under different conditions just makes value not objective.

> Mandatory contraceptive coverage, as a policy, has nothing to do with gender rating for insurance coverage because previously insurance companies weren't even required to offer policies that covered maternity costs.

Yet they did, sometimes to the exclusion of not covering birth control.

Oddly this is because it might be cheaper to cover the small % of women who have children in a given year than providing the % who don't birth control, which would mean the opposite conclusion from cost pooling occurs if that's the case, depending on the composition of their customers.

To be more specific, absolute accuracy is not a necessary condition for the industry, while relative accuracy (versus competitors) is necessary for individual firms.  Legislative action that affects all insurers equally will not have an effect on the viability of either the industry or individual firms (unless some firms are unable to adjust their models due to incompetence).

cuwbpjn,1,t3_3kbd4z,Riggaman,"Prior to the passage of the ACA, women were charged more for health insurance because they accumulated more health care costs over their lifetime. This is generally because of three factors: 1. Maternity, 2. OB/GYN and other women-specific care, and 3. Women are generally better about seeing a primary care physician earlier in life than men. This may keep them healthier, but they still rack up more costs long term than men (though costs even out significantly after 65, when Medicare is picking up most of the tab instead of private companies).

Car insurance, on the other hand, is based on *behavior*. By that I mean, generally speaking, men drive more aggressively and are therefore more likely to get into accidents than women (or at least serious accidents due to speed/aggression). This is an important distinction, because unlike health insurance, which is intended to cover preventive care in addition to hospital services, car insurance can more accurately be described as *accident* insurance. You don't use insurance for oil changes or tune ups, and the shitty (mostly unregulated) cost-sharing structure (e.g., deductibles) of car insurance means most small accidents are paid for out of pocket anyway. 

So when we talk about ""fairness"" we are really talking about equity in terms of what is and is not within people's control. Congress decided in 2010 that because women have no control over their gender they cannot be held accountable for the higher costs.

They play it safe by charging everybody with a particular characteristic a little bit more, because to charge a few actually risky people a lot more would be logistically impossible. 

And, for what it's worth, they do take into account the driving record when scoring you.

That said, the type of care that women require, should it be underutilized, would lead to higher expenses overall. 

For example, if a woman decides to skip regular gynecologist visits, she could be at risk for developing any number of uniquely female conditions that are much more expensive to treat as they progress. Generally speaking, this is what happens to men too when they neglect preventive care. The difference is *when* these long-term problems manifest. Women are more likely to develop long-term issues stemming from lack of care earlier in life, which means they are covered by private insurance instead of Medicare.

cuwnl1c,1,t3_3kbd4z,xiipaoc,"It's not fair.  It's definitely legal, though.

There are good arguments to be made for both sides, right?  If it costs more to insure men than women for something, it's not discrimination to charge them different amounts; it's a reflection of the actual reality.  On the other hand, a particular man may be a much safer driver than most women, and he still has to pay more for insurance.

Health care, though, is going in a different direction.  It used to be that we would have health insurance -- you pay an insurance company some money every month because you never know when a health disaster could befall you.  Of course, if you had a chronic condition, you would be much more expensive to insure because they already knew that they'd have to spend a lot of money on you.  The trouble is that, today, health prices are so, so, so high that people just can't afford to pay for basic stuff -- medicine, doctors, etc. -- without health insurance.  The thing is, health care isn't something you only need in a health disaster -- a car crash, an infected appendix, whatever.  And we ended up with a system which completely depended on people having health insurance, because prices for services and such were negotiated with the insurance companies and a person without insurance would just have to pay whatever, which is much, much higher than the price that the insurance company pays, which is much, much higher than the price that the insurance company's *customer* pays (though they do have to pay a lot each month to cover it).

What's obvious is that the insurance model for health care is just not working.  Car insurance works -- you only call up your car insurance company when you have a car accident, and those are essentially random and infrequent.  On the other hand, you need health care coverage pretty much constantly, not for ER visits but for routine checkups and follow-ups and medications.  The Affordable Care Act's main goal was to move health care away from health insurance towards health coverage.  You had people like Rand Paul complain that ""Obamacare"" is not health insurance because companies can't ask about preexisting conditions anymore and that's not how insurance works.  That's a pretty dumb argument, though, because, yes, of course it's not how insurance works; it's not supposed to be because that's a bad model for health care coverage.  Obamacare has been widely panned as ""socialized health care"".  That's a good way to scare those very scare-able conservatives!  Yes, of course it's socialized health care.  That's the whole idea.  The insurance model failed, but the universal health care model works.",2,0,1441887140,1444731078

And I'm betting your numbers are bullshit like every other claim I've ever seen to this effect.  I programed Health insurance claims processing software for three years.  Take away reproductive related costs and males cost more, not less, to insure.  Anyone who says otherwise is fudging the numbers hard.

Usually the fudging is done by misclassifying reproductive medicine as non-reproductive medicine and counting it in the wrong column.  There is more to safe reproduction than rushing to the hospital in the middle of labor.  Another source of fudging is society expecting women to provide, for free, medical services to men.  For example, Elderly women are more likely to end up in nursing homes than elderly men [ Largely because when elderly men need nursing they usually have a wife to do it in their own home. ](http://www.indiana.edu/~econdept/workshops/Fall_2008_Papers/Li_IHsin_Nursing_Home_stay_08072008.pdf).  

> In addition, a study from 2003 Family Caregiver Alliance at the National Center on Caregiving indicates that 59% to 75% of informal caregivers are females, and female caregivers may spend as much as 50% more time on providing care than male caregivers. Thus, elderly men have a higher chance of receiving informal care at home and, therefore, delaying their entrance into a nursing home.

There would be three times as many men in nursing homes as there are now if women weren't providing so much free medical care to men.  Or if you prefer we can call nursing home fees ""rent"" and not count them as medical care for anyone ... in which case elder men's per-capita medical costs exceed that of elderly women.  Which takes us to another source of fudging, not calculating elder costs by gender per capita.

Here are some facts:

* [men are 33% more likely to be smokers than women](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/smoking-adults-by-gender/)
* Which leads to [men having 78/54 = 1.44 = 44% more cases of Lung Cancer last year than women](http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/p0109-lung-cancer.html).  Smokers also have higher rates of strokes, hypertension, respiratory illness, etc. 
* [70% of US men are overweight compared to only 57% of US women](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/adult-overweightobesity-rate-by-gender/).
* Among the many things being fatasses causes, [US men are 17% more likely to be diabetic than US women](http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/prev/national/figbysex.htm).
* [Men consistently have higher rates of alcohol-related deaths and hospitalizations than women](http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/mens-health.htm).  Hospitalizations are *expensive*.  
* [It is estimated that about 17% of men and about 8% of women will meet criteria for alcohol dependence at some point in their lives.](http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/mens-health.htm).  Also Alcohol consumption increases the risk of cancer.  [For example, Men are 5 times more likely to get throat cancer than women.](http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-types/throat-cancer/prevention/index.html).
* Hell, [Men contract almost every form of cancer at a much higher rate than women](http://healthland.time.com/2011/07/13/almost-every-type-of-cancer-kills-more-men-than-women-study-shows/).  Smoking and drinking being key contributors as to why.
* Another way the numbers are fudged is by not breaking out boys and girls but rather treating ""children"" as monolithic.  But in 2010 [little boys were 19.8% more likely to be taken to the ER with a condition that merited hospitalization than little girls](http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb157.pdf).  And around 12% more likely than girls to be taken to the emergency room period.  ER care is the most expensive care.  And pediatric ER visits account for about a fifth of all ER visits although the bulk don't result in hospitalization thank goodness.
* In fact, up until age 14 ( puberty! When reproductive costs start accruing for birth control, checkups, etc ) [boys are just flat out more expensive to provide medical care to than girls](http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/childrens-health-spending-2009-2012).   So much more so that even with reproductive costs factoring in it takes another 4 years for total expenditures for boys and girls to even out around age 18.
* [Boys are more frequently born premature/malformed, more susceptible to complications when sick, more likely to have disabilities, and develop motor skills more slowly leading to greater incidents of self-injury](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-05-25/news/0805240292_1_male-fetuses-infant-mortality-rate-boys)
* One of the reasons boys and men have more developmental problems is that there are a whole host of genetic disorders that are almost never seen in women.  This can be from a malformed Y chromosome but is usually from a malformed X chromosome.  Disabled men are unlikely to have children and pass a broken Y along, but women can carry a malformed X with no ill effect because their other X chromosome compensates.  If a son inherits the broken X he has no second X to compensate and a developmental disorder manifests.  [Stephan Hawking suffered from a particularly severe example of this](http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis).  Oh, and most of these malformed children are cared for - for free, at home, by their mothers, instead of being put into care facilities

Note, that in addition to a broken X Stephan's mom also gave him life itself.  A different X chromosome would not have created the brilliant Stephan Hawking but rather some other person.

**Ignoring medical costs related to reproduction, males simply cost more.  This is very clear prior to puberty at which point women start incurring costs related to maintaining reproductive systems.  In the senior years women hugely subsidize men by providing free nursing care.**

Stop fucking whining.  You were committing highway robbery asking us to pay more to give you life and you are still coming out ahead overall.  And thats without even taking into account how the women pay our half of the $$ costs and all of the blood price to create new life.

You are getting off easy.  Now stop smoking and lose some weight.

Edit to add: Also, if you want to reduce reproductive costs write your senator/house rep to remind them that [the American College of OB/GYNs sees no reason with the Pill needs to be a prescription drug](http://www.acog.org/About-ACOG/News-Room/News-Releases/2012/Ob-Gyns-Want-the-Pill-Available-OTC), it is sold over the counter in over 30 countries, and its price is massively lower when it is sold OTC as the providers have to compete with each other in a way they do not have to when she can only buy the one on her Rx.  Also, it being OTC means that reproductive age women are no longer required to visit the doctor every 6 months to renew their Rx.  Which further reduces medical costs.

Cause a good chunk of the money we all now have to pay is bullshit expenses created by bratty religious jerks trying to control people's sex lives.  Now that they are screwing you over too join the fight to put a stop to it.
