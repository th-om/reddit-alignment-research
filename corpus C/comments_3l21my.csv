He also didn't have a TV show for years and have a household name recognition. However - the idea that the love affair with the ""straight shooter"" business man is a new thing in the GOP seems demonstrably false to me.

But I do think you are right - the rise of Carson seems to be a better comparison to Cain... But in that instance Carson has the bump because he came to political fame years ago, and not in the year he started running.

I never said they did. They are the establishment candidates that a lot of people expect one of them to eventually win. The establishment combined is polling at like <20 percent at this point. They aren't going to win the primary. 

3 weeks ago it was, ""well once some of these other guys drop out of the race, their supporters will all join up around one candidate and crush Trump."" Doesn't look like that's going to happen.

Did you happen to read the article in this thread?

Not really. The press is having a field day with Carson and Trump. Trump is the car-wreck or cat-fight that everyone pulls over to watch and then go on with the rest of their lives never thinking about it again - or embarrassed that they pulled over to rubberneck. Carson is that intellectual professor type you really want to see take over the department... but his leadership quality is not that dynamic. In the end, neither has the credentials.

cv2z0l8,0,t1_cv2xnse,Fuckdabullshit,">I think only 1 guy dropped out so far - that was Perry.

Yes, but if you add up the total support for all the establishment candidates, they as a group don't even poll as well as Trump. If Rubio, Walker, Cruz, and Christie all dropped out tomorrow and every single person supporting them went to Bush, Bush would still be polling below Trump. Trump and Carson are pulling over half the GOP right now. That leaves less than half for the establishment. This idea that all the establishment supporters will team up and beat out Trump doesn't hold when you look at the math. There aren't enough supporters for those guys. 

>Did you happen to read the article in this thread?

I don't see any article linked in this thread. 

>Not really. 

Scott Walker, polling at 2 percent, isn't fighting to stay relevant? You can't be serious. 

Bush is in free fall mode. His support has been halved in the last month. 

Rubio has had his support slowly dropping meaning he's not picking up any of the Bush/Walker defectors or at a minimum he's losing more than he's gaining. 

Cruz is the only one hanging in there, and the best thing he's doing for himself is riding Trump's coattails. 

By the logic many have been using of the establishment candidates splitting support, when one has started to falter, like Walker has, we should see support for one of the others rising but the exact opposite has happened. They are all losing support. 

>In the end, neither has the credentials.
