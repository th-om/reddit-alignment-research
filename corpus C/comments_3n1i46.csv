Socialist governments tend to heavily subsidize the cost of basic goods, which means unscrupulous people will take more than they need and sell them on the black market in the nearest capitalist country.  You can see this happening right now with Venezuela, and while they have plenty of problems of their own making, it's certainly not helping matters.

Free education also tends to be a feature of socialist governments, but salaries also tend to be lower.  So they are often confronted with brain drain, where their top students leave to go to a country that will pay them more, and the socialist government loses the investment in that individuals education.  Most of them try to control this by tightly restricting emigration, but that's a lot easier to do in Cuba or North Korea than it is when your border is half a continent long.

Capitalist countries on the other hand doesn't really lose anything by having socialist neighbors, so they can tolerate the existence of competing ideologies a lot better; especially if its one like China that doesn't mind leveraging their cheap labor force to manufacture goods or harvest resources for the capitalists to purchase.

Communism calls for all capitalist states to fall, and be repalced with socialist economies.  It calls for the bourgeoisie to lose power, and counter revolutionaries to be suppressed or killed.  Only when these conditions are met is when International Communism is possible, where the socialist world can work together and abolish their states.

Soooo, the goal of the USSR was simple: take down the US, kill the rich, liberate all capitalist states, and conquer the world ideologically.

Another way to look at this is through the World System Theory.  As of right now, the global economic system is capitalism.  Having a different economic system exist here means it will be actively resisted.  A global economic system tries to maintain itself and stifle other existing economic systems.  The USSR being a superpower was the only reason socialist states were standing in the global capitalist system.  When it fell, almost all socialist states fell too.
