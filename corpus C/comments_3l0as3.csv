The police state is entirely optional. its not a rational response to the problem of terrorism. The special measures taken by the TSA/NSA have stopped a whopping 0-10 terrorist attacks or something like that. If you don't like the police state then vote against it. Banning all muslim immigrants is a completely illogical response to the problem. There is nothing more harmful about muslim immigrants than other types of immigrants.

Wow this is incredibly low and you know it. You are trying to tie terrorism in general to these immigrants and you have absolutely no justification for doing so. You know full well that the vast majority of terrorism is not from muslim immigrants. 9/11 was committed by foreigners, not immigrants. The Oklahoma city bombing was committed by a non-immigrant. No crime ever committed by a muslim immigrant approaches those two crimes. Its honestly despicable for you to slander these people in such a dishonest way.

And as I have explained that response is ridiculous and disproportionate. Street crime is many times larger of a threat than terrorism. Even if we had 1 9/11 every year street crime would still be a much greater threat. The measures that you don't like such as not taking golf clubs on planes is a choice that some hysterical people made, it has nothing to do with what is necessary to combat terrorism.

Also you are again trying to conflate all terrorism with muslim immigrants, people who haven't committed any major acts of terrorism in the USA.

We can do it. We live in a democracy. If you elect someone to stop these activities they will do it. Its not complicated. Its no different than getting the government to stop all muslim immigration. One requires the government to be rational about security. The other requires the government to abandon liberal values. I dont see why you think the former is more realistic than the latter.

I have seen zero evidence that the electorate is capable of electing leaders who are rational about these things.  Following any kind of attack, either mass shooting by schizo guy or muslim guy, elected officials feel tremendous pressure to DO SOMETHING.  Never let a tragedy go to waste.  That's the nature of elected office, and its not going to change.  The only practical way to lessen the risk to our liberty is to less the risk of terrorists reaching our soil.  And better mental health care, but that's besides my point.

Because nobody is talking about letting in large groups of foreign white supremacists and schizophrenics.  If such a group showed up at the border, of course I would want them sent home.

If the worlds population could chose between a nation that killed about 5 million of its own people and a nation that has killed dozen of millions of peoples from other nations, I am pretty sure NK would be very much preferred.

Dont get me wrong, what NK is doing is absoultey atrocious and inhuman but numberwise its a joke compared to the US murder campaigns.

Mind you, the US is mainly killing innocent civilians. Far more than NK, ISIS or the entire world combined. And all in the name of doing good, fighting evil. If the US would stop fighting evil there would be a lot less evil in our world. Imagine what the US could do with the trillions they spent on killing other people. Education, social security, welfare programs, space exploration...

But the US has to kill other people instead. In 20 years the US reign over this planet will have cost more lives than the second world war. In 50 years more people will have been killed by the US than died in both world wars combined.

But North Korea will still only have killed a fraction of these numbers. And the better state in this regard. 30 000 000 > 5 000 000.
