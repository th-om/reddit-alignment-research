3nlbwx,I'd like to hear what reddit thinks about legalized prostitution.,88,dovetc,"I saw on Wikipedia that today is apparently ""International Day of no Prostitution"" and figured what better time and place to gauge sentiment on the matter.  I'm fairly agnostic on the issue, and have heard good points on both sides.  So, is prostitution a matter of a woman's right to do with her body what she wishes?  Is it an inherently abusive relationship?  Does it work in the places it has been legalized and regulated or is it still fraught with problems there as it may be elsewhere?
