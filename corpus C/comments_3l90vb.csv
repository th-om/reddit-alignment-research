Trump did perfectly fine for a front runner. Fended off attacks with ease and charisma, restated his positions and didn't do anything to harm his massive lead. He dominated the talking time and literally every other question was in some way about him. 

He was easily the most entertaining of all the candidates and that is what really matters this far out.  ",1,0,1442462908,1444727773
cv61a7u,1,t3_3l90vb,Humanatee69,"You need to consider where Trump is getting his support from. His base isn't one that cares about policy or experience, they simply sympathize with him as an anti establishment candidate.
Therefore things that would end other campaigns actually enhance his. 

What do his supporters want? An entertaining, anti-establishment candidate who speaks candidly. That is exactly what he did and his supporters will be invigorated by it.

Anybody who has studied any politics at all knows Trump would be an absolutely abysmal presidential choice and that has been clear since he started running. However his 'gaffes' are actually resonating with a sizeable group of people and if he buckled up and started acting like a 'politician' now he'd likely lose support quickly.
