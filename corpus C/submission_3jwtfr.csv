3jwtfr,How are we supposed to take informed stances without any concrete information or transparency regarding our government spending?,18,Wagga_Wagga,"I don't know where I stand on economic issues half of the time because I don't know how much money the government has. It's like guesswork without knowing what our budgets are. I feel like it's akin to trying to make important financial decisions for myself without even knowing what my bank balances are. 

Why isn't the general public fighting for more transparency? I feel like that would be the first step towards making informed decisions on government spending and taxation. I feel like people in a democracy (I know, its not really a democracy anymore, but still) deserve to know how much money is being hoarded and in which sectors of government. 

Is there a website that has transparent, clear, and concise details of how much money the government has and what we're spending on? And if not, why isn't there one? ONLY THEN will I be able to take informed stances on what we should be putting our money into.
