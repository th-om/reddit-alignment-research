All we know is how well the ONLY real other candidate in the race can compete in two states that are tailored to his demographic base when he has NO active competition and nobody calling him on his bullshit. 

He gets to campaign on his terms with nobody campaigning against him. 

She has barely started. She has far far far far more money, more establishment support, a much stronger national campaign infrastructure and GOTV operation, needs to win fewer states due to superdelegates, incredibly wide demographic support. 

Not to mention that in the latest poll she would be +15 without Biden and that it has a VERY VERY high margin of error for a national poll. They literally only polled 200 or so people. 

I don't expect the next poll to line up with this one.

She is technically campaigning, but she is intentionally doing so in a way that lets her keep a low profile. She is doing smaller, more intimate events rather than the massive, stadium packing rallies that you see from the other candidates. Once you start seeing these kinds of rallies from Clinton, you'll know she's ratcheting up her campaign. I expect her to start ""seriously"" campaigning in the next couple of months.

> Why is it advantageous for her to be letting her image be demolished right now while she just sits back?

Avoiding gaffes, mostly. I'm a Clinton supporter, and I cringed at the shrug she gave when asked about emails. But that was relatively minor, so much so that many might not consider it a gaffe.

Furthermore, she's probably just trying to ride out the news cycle and let the email stuff blow over. Obstinately fighting the email allegations might contribute to their legitimacy. In the words of Shakespeare, ""The lady doth protest too much, methinks.""

> why doesn't she just hit the gas now? Why doesn't she just hit the gas now and continue hitting it in the future?

Not sure if you're a sports person, but have you heard the phrase ""peaking too early"" before? Where a playoff team looks amazing and is phenomenal in the beginning, but fades as they get further into the playoffs and ends up losing? That's why. Hillary has been intentionally trying to lay low for over a year because she doesn't want to peak too early.

Which is bigger, a gaffe, or a scandal? Whether or not you believe the email thing to be a justified scandal or a created one, it beats the hell out of a gaffe.

Clinton is most definitely not where she would like to be, nor did I ever say that she was. Clinton would very much prefer that the email stuff go away.

I'm not saying she isn't campaigning, she's just doing it in a much slower pace. She's gathering support but you don't see the massive Hillary pep rallies just yet that you're seeing with a lot of other candidates. They're trying to be the center of national attention while she is waiting in the wings. 

>So by what metrics is she not campaigning? When will she start campaigning? How will we know when she's started? 

I'm basing this pretty much on what I'm seeing from the media. When she starts giving speeches and laying out policy in front of a crowd of cheering and diverse youths, I'll say she's starting to go out in full force. 

>Why is it advantageous for her to be letting her image be demolished right now while she just sits back?

I don't see her image as being demolished, the people who want to attack her will do it one way or another, as she is the biggest threat to anyone running for president. Her opening her mouth and possibly getting into a bigger hole about emails or anything will do nothing but hurt her in the short run. 

> If she has the ability to turn things around, or to garner massive support when she ""hits the gas"", why doesn't she just hit the gas now

Because she doesn't have to. Let the Republicans bicker amongst themselves, the last thing she should do is say something and have all of them use it as a common enemy. She'll save it for a time much closer to the primaries and general election. 

>Why doesn't she just hit the gas now and continue hitting it in the future

She could, but attention spans are short in this country. It would be expensive and potentially dangerous for her to go all out, so early in the race.

Check out those polls again -- her image is really getting bashed, and she's not controlling public perception at all right now. I think it's much harder to gain back support than to maintain it. If she can maintain it, why doesn't she? 

> Her opening her mouth and possibly getting into a bigger hole about emails or anything will do nothing but hurt her in the short run.

She literally has opened her mouth about the email thing again and again and again this summer.
