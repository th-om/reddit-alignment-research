It is unfortunately not a very large market, and there's some inefficiency as a result as well as some occasional failures of fluidity. The only part that is really annoying is that since they rely on a market model rather than a straight bookie model, they have to shave off a tiny amount of profit and also they have a 30 day rule for withdrawing money from their system (although I've been told by other people that in practice they'll often do it faster than that, so the 30 day may be more to cover their behinds). They also have a cap of $850 as how much one can put in any given contract- this was mandated by their deal with the US government. 

This has made for some strange issues: for example if one looks at the Bernie Sanders bet, they are overvalued compared to most European markets, and this is likely because the cap combines with many enthusiastic American fans of Bernie as well as the fact that since Bernie yes shares are cheaper than Bernie no shares, a Bernie yes buyer can move the market more than a Bernie no buyer if they both try to max out.

What most on here need to remember is that we're engaged in politics and engage in debate with each other.  Generally we're aware of political issues, have our own ideology and for the most part, select our candidates based on how a candidate's ideology aligns with ours.

It would be a mistake to think that a large percentage of voters actually analyze candidates, critically analyzing their positions and trying to separate fact from B.S.

Obama won with his charisma, personality and message of hope and change.  His lack of experience meant nothing to most voters.

Trump's soundbites are resonating with voters, his character flaws are overlooked given his air of confidence and message that he will make America great again.  People don't care about how the sausage is made, they simply want to eat it, and right now, Trumps message is resonating as well as pervasive throughout the media.

I was in the Dr.'s office yesterday.  The View was on the television.  Normally I wouldn't waste my time on the idiotic dribble that is spewed on that show but watched in amazement as Trump was interviewed via phone and simply charmed the hosts with his humor and B.S.  By the end of the interview, the hosts were discussing how kind Donald was - they weren't outraged over his immigration policy and the most difficult discussion was around Planned Parenthood funding.

Donald is winning, I never expected it at all but in today's world I need to wrap my brain around the fact that many votes will be influenced from people watching shows like The View.  Donald doesn't need to spend advertising money like other candidates, his name gets him interviews and air time virtually everywhere.

Big ifs. It's one thing to promise those things - and Republicans have been promising a border wall since Reagan - but delivering is another matter. There are a ton of practical considerations, and Trump is noticeably dismissive when asked about those. Republicans, especially Republicans from southern states, have been trying to get that wall going for decades. They've spent billions of dollars and gotten a porous fence on about a third of the border. A lot of that land is owned by people - whether it's ranchers or somebody else - so there's the matter of getting eminent domain, there's environmental impact studies, the cost of construction (and maintenance - walls don't just stay up forever, they need to be repaired periodically), and the question of whether it would even be worth it. Drug lords are already just tunneling under the border fence we do have.

As far as deporting the millions of undocumented immigrants...there's just no practical way to do that. This is another one of those talking points Republicans have had for decades, but when pressed on it, they can never explain how they're going to track down and deport 11 million people who, by definition, don't have documents making them easy to track down and deport.

Not to mention that he'd have to have the votes in Congress to do either of those things, and getting those votes is not very likely.",1,0,1441985353,1444730238

""he answer, researchers found, is quite a lot, both to taxpayers and the economy more broadly. Removing all 11.2 million undocumented immigrants, both forcibly and through Mitt Romney's infamous ""self-deportation"" policy, would take about 20 years and cost the government between $400 billion and $600 billion. The impact on the economy would be even larger, according to the study: Real GDP would drop by nearly $1.6 trillion and the policy would shave 5.7 percent off economic growth. Researchers Laura Collins and Ben Gitis also write that their estimates are conservative, since they do not include, for example, the cost of constructing new courts, prisons, and other buildings that might be needed to process and detain millions of immigrants""

[Paul Krugman actually wrote about this in his blog.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/opinion/paul-krugman-trump-is-right-on-economics.html) He notes the Jeb Bush's offensive against Trump hasn't been ""Look at all this racist shit he's saying,"" but rather ""He's not a true fiscal conservative."" And, as Krugman notes:

>And here’s what’s interesting: all indications are that Mr. Bush’s attacks on Mr. Trump are falling flat, because the Republican base doesn’t actually share the Republican establishment’s economic delusions.

>The thing is, we didn’t really know that until Mr. Trump came along. The influence of big-money donors meant that nobody could make a serious play for the G.O.P. nomination without pledging allegiance to supply-side doctrine, and this allowed the establishment to imagine that ordinary voters shared its antipopulist creed. Indeed, Mr. Bush’s hapless attempt at a takedown suggests that his political team still doesn’t get it, and thinks that pointing out The Donald’s heresies will be enough to doom his campaign.

That's not that surprising. The republican base responds very well to machismo and confidence. Though there wasn't too much on that list that was particularly left-wing. It just wasn't the normal right-wing shtick.

> literally no superpac money

He *is* superpac money.

All of the other candidates are up there trying not to say anything stupid, they need money.

This gives Trump free reign to say whatever he wants, because if anybody crosses him too hard, he can literally bank-roll their opponents. 

I don't think this is Hitler in Germany though. I mean, sure there are parallels. The German people wanted a scapegoat after being humiliated during a war in which not a single foreign troop ended up on German soil (WWI obviously). It could be, but I don't think so. 

But all of us working 60 hour weeks and just scraping by? All of us that look at the taxes taken out of our paychecks while the roads slowly and inevitably get worse? Those of us that got laid off and don't qualify for the benefits that we paid for.

And still the economy stagnates?

We're totally looking for scapegoats. 

And then a billionaire shows up. He says: ""I know money. You were doing it right. It's not your fault. It's these people's fault.""

That is powerful stuff.

demonstrates this. In both 2008 and 2012, President Obama won a combined 80 percent of the
votes of all minority voters, including not only African Americans but also Hispanics, Asians, and
others. The minority groups that President Obama carried with 80 percent of the vote in 2012 are
on track to become a majority of the nation’s population by 2050. Today these minority groups
make up 37 percent of the population, and they cast a record 28 percent of the votes in the 2012
presidential election, according to the election exit polls, an increase of 2 percentage points from
2008. We have to work harder at engaging demographic partners and allies. One outside group
that has been particularly successful at engaging its community and increasing its Republican
support is the Republican Jewish Coalition. We should incorporate some of its tactics in our efforts.

>By 2050, the Hispanic share of the U.S. population could be as high as 29 percent, up from
17 percent now. The African American proportion of the population is projected to rise slightly
to 14.7 percent, while the Asian share is projected to increase to approximately 9 percent from
its current 5.1 percent. Non-Hispanic whites, 63 percent of the current population, will decrease
to half or slightly less than half of the population by 2050.
In addition, the Republican Party lost youth and women voters in 2012. It is imperative that
we reverse this troubling trend, as women represent the majority of voters and youth are future
voters for decades to come.
