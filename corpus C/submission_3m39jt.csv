3m39jt,"Dems and Repubs alike don't want 3rd party spoilers, so what if the POTUS vote was always a head-to-head race?",19,ninekilnmegalith,"We basically have a two-party system, historically it wasn't always the same two, but our Congressional and Presidency contests have largely been battles between two parties.

Given this historical love in the US, for the left v. right, white v. black, our guy against yours electoral process, what if We changed the rules and made the general election a strictly two candidate vote. But, during the primary season, the candidate from any political party who garners the top two vote totals, will then make it to the general election.

This could take the fear out of voting for a non-majority party. For those that worry about ""throwing their vote away"" or ""letting the *other* side win,"" you'll have a chance in the Primary to vote for the ""good candidate."" Herd mentality should favor two candidates who oppose each other during the primary election, bi-polar elections being the natural favorite of most voters. After the primary season, the media largely ignores candidates from outside the two major parties, why make them suffer through a primary and a general?",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3m39jt/dems_and_repubs_alike_dont_want_3rd_party/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443029458,1444724948
