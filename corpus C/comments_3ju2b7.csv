cusfugq,1,t3_3ju2b7,mrmoustache8765,"> What if all refugees were placed in a common pool regardless of where they applied for asylum, processed in internationally funded centres under humane conditions, then resettled according to a defined set of rules and equitably distributed between signatories according to how many refugees they can accommodate (based on GDP per capita for example)?

The problem we're seeing right now is that refugees want to be settled in country that is rich, powerful, has good welfare and opportunities for work. Right now that country seems to be Germany, and you're seeing refugees trying to sneak through countries like Hungary without getting fingerprinted so that they can go on to Germany and be settled there. So while I think your idea could work I also think that for it to work there has to be some sort of method to force some people to settle in countries that may not be too appealing for them. Germany's taking in a lot of refugees but they can't take them all. 

Also we need to see the surrounding Arab countries to start taking in refugees.    ",5,0,1441546419,1444732238
cut6qfy,0,t1_cusfugq,AbstractSpaces,I guess Europe would have to modify their visa rules so people with refugee visas can't become permanent residents of neighbouring countries. That introduces its own headaches though.,1,0,1441602702,1444732238
cuspiv3,1,t3_3ju2b7,snacksinhats,"Your idea sounds like a great idea... if money were no question, resources were infinite, and there was an army of hundreds of thousands of aid-givers on the ground to enact everything.

I feel absolutely horrible for those people who have to risk life and limb to leave their home countries. After all, there is nothing wrong with wanting a better life.

But, and this is a big deal, Europe simply isn't equipped to handle a massive onslaught of millions of poor, uneducated asylum seekers. European countries are already having trouble funding their own social safety networks, and now they're being put in a position to fund healthcare/education/housing for people who have never contributed to the respective tax bases.

cusfqw8,1,t3_3ju2b7,Vayate,"The EU is trying it, and the only result has been further erosion of national sovereignty by forcing countries to take ""refugees."" Unsurprisingly, few migrants want to take refuge in Greece.

Also let's be honest about what this is. These are economic migrants. They're leaving because their country is a war zone, but they're using that as an excuse to travel to the countries that offer the most welfare to economic migrants. If they just wanted to escape the war, they would be in refugee camps near the border with the other War refugees.",3,0,1441546123,1444732242

No nation in the history of this planet has benefited from massive third-world immigration.

I'm of the personal opinion that we need to start sinking these boats before the situation gets much worse. If the EU had any common sense, they'd put out an immediate blanket ban on accepting or housing any ""refugees"" and begin with mass deportation.",1,0,1441564934,1444732242
