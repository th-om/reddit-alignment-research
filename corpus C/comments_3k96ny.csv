>saying he's not a misogynist and then claiming Megyn Kelley was 'bleeding from wherever'

Even if this is a reference to her big bloody period, which is doubtful if you actually listened to the soundbite and the way he said it, it's not misogyny.  Saying a woman might have been on her period, even in a juvenile or insulting way, is not the same thing as thinking she's a lesser person because she's a woman.  You can mock or insult a group without actually thinking they are worse than you. But I'm sure you knew that.

>to claiming because he can build a skyscraper he could somehow erect over 1900 miles of border wall.

The funny thing about the wall is he only wants it because he thinks it would be cool to have his own wall.  As we all know most immigration, illegal or otherwise doesn't happen through border jumping.  The wall is just an impressive structure he wants to build, for the sake of personal glory. And it's certainly possible, although I do doubt he'd really follow through.

I kinda agree with your last paragraph but you should refrain from acting like he's such a cartoon.  One of the points he's proving right now, which you acknowledged, is that this is basically what America wants.  They want someone who doesn't follow all of the conventional demands of society, simply for the sake of his image.  Every time I hear someone complain about how insulting he is it screams hypocrisy. Everybody says insensitive things and has unpopular views.  We have been stuck in a society that for some reason pretends this isn't the case and attacks anyone who gets caught behaving any other way than perfect in the public eye.  I think this is a pretty good message.  If you don't like Trump then you don't like him, but at least you have something real to base that decision on.  He is spitting in the face of the long time practice in politics where we pretend like all our candidates are somehow infallible people. I can guarantee you someone like Hillary Clinton has said shit just as revolting as what Trump say, she just won't say anything that isn't perfectly scripted in public.  

The tremendous irony is that insulting language will lose all of its power as soon as society begins to allow it again.  Sometimes people are just offensive, and there's nothing wrong with it.  You can choose, as our society does, to act like it's the end of the world and shun people for it, or you can grow the fuck up and not let it bother you.

I don't really know why you need this to be pointed out to you, but if Megyn Kelly being a woman on her period affected the questions she asked (which YES is doubtful), then there SHOULD be nothing wrong with saying so. For the record, Trump has made no such assertion anyway. Now let's say he really was talking about her period causing her to ask those questions, and let's say he's wrong and that her being a woman had absolutely nothing to do with it.  That STILL doesn't make him a misogynist, it just makes him WRONG.  Thinking that being a woman results in different behavior than being a man is not misogyny.  Thinking that some of these behavioral differences are preferable certainly isn't misogyny.  And guess what, thinking that some are less preferable isn't misogyny either.  Misogyny is actually a pretty bad thing and it's disgusting that the term is used so flippantly. Nowhere does Trump ever give off the impression that he views women as being of a lower class of human than men.  At worst, he overestimated the influence of Megyn Kelly's period on her debate questions. I can't believe you needed that spelled out for you.
