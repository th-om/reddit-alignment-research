No, because GMO corn is corn. They don't even specify what type of corn it is, normally, on ingredients lists. GMO is a description of the intent behind a process applied to a product, it doesn't refer to any physical quality of the product.

A government shutdown is a form of governing.  It's a last-ditch effort to hopefully force changes.  ",0,0,1443640508,1444721564

Anything is a form of governing if you lower the bar enough.  Damaging the thing you're supposed to be working for is not a *good* form of governing.  Particularly when our system of government is based on the sharing of power.

You think not paying people for their labor and cutting off necessary government services is a good way to govern??

And the non-payment of debt isn't in danger right this very moment, no, but it's going to come up again, and the same people who tried to damage the USA the first time are still in power.

The nonpayment of debt isn't on the table.  They'll cut the spending first.

That's not what happened last time.  They were unable to get what they wanted in actual legislation, so they refused to pay the nation's debts.  They did not cut spending.

By the way, your ""majority vote"" thing comes into play here.

Untrue.  There was never an issue in paying the debts, but rather issuing new debt.

Technically true when we get down to the brass tacks of the sequester, but my point still stands.

Still comes down to ""and we voted and lost the vote.""  In fact, they voted several times on this and lost the vote.  Moreover, they are making a lot of false claims as justification for their view.  So I'm not sure we agree on which is the extreme circumstance.

>Untrue. There was never an issue in paying the debts, but rather issuing new debt.

No, I'm sorry, but that's not how it worked out.  The USA needed to pay its debt, the GoP refused to pay it *because* they said they didn't want new debt (although the debt was already incurred, so it wasn't really new debt).  It was not additional spending, it was the actual paying off of existing debt.

>You'd be hard pressed to find a lot of Republicans who consider the Bush years a ""utopia.""

You'd be hard pressed to find anyone who considered it a utopia, but the point was that the GoP controlled congress, the POTUS, and the SCOTUS.  It literally had all three branches of government and could do pretty much whatever it wanted.  What did they do?  Start some wars, raise spending, incur massive debt, create a ""faith based initiative"" whose sole purpose was to skirt existing laws on charitable contributions.  And then cut taxes.

They didn't lose it as much as didn't win it, given the measures in place and the rules of the chambers.

Sorry, this is 100% wrong.  The Republicans were happy to pay the existing debt.  It's the issuing of the new debt that was at issue.

> You'd be hard pressed to find anyone who considered it a utopia, but the point was that the GoP controlled congress, the POTUS, and the SCOTUS.

Never controlled SCOTUS, never had a majority in the Senate.

Semantics, really.  They had the house, they could have brought it to a vote and lost, but they knew they didn't have the votes, so they didn't do that.

>Sorry, this is 100% wrong. The Republicans were happy to pay the existing debt. It's the issuing of the new debt that was at issue.

I understand why you might think that.  That's certainly what the guys trying to take down our economy were saying, but it doesn't really line up with what [actually happened](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/30/absolutely-everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-government-shutdown-will-work/).  ""New debt"" means new spending, and the budget gap they were supposed to close wasn't new spending, it was making payments on existing debt.  They were refusing to sign the bill that would pay our existing debt because they, wrongly, felt that it was adding to the overall debt.

>Never controlled SCOTUS, never had a majority in the Senate.

Right, nobody officially controls the SCOTUS because it's ostensibly impartial, but they had put in conservative judges and had a conservative majority, so yeah, they controlled the SCOTUS.  

And the 109th senate was a GoP majority.",1,0,1443711972,1444721564
