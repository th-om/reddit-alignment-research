3lq7qc,What's a better immigration system?,54,jctennis123,"In the past, I have posted about illegal immigration and said that it is hurting the U.S. economy. Turns out, illegal immigration is good for the U.S. economy. I couldn't find any sources that said it wasn't and many redditors kindly and not-so-kindly have provided me with sources that said illegal immigration is good for the U.S.

So...what should we do? If this is good thing, we must reform the process so that it can be legal and we must be able to control who comes in and who goes out of the country. What should the rules be? Is there a number where, if we let too many in, it begins to hurt the U.S. economy?
