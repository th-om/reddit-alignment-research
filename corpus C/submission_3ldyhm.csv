3ldyhm,Why are people attracted to Carson despite his somewhat crazy ideas?,36,lalaland1125,"Carson appears to be doing quite well in the polls. This really confuses me because it appears that Carson holds some rather extreme ideas that go against scientific fact.

Why should I vote for him despite these strange beliefs?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ldyhm/why_are_people_attracted_to_carson_despite_his/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442546358,1444727275
