As an actual campaigner though, he's lackluster. He's pretty steadfast in defending his moderate stances, like immigration and education, which I give him kudos for because he seems to be avoiding what Mitt Romney did by running right in the primaries to the detriment of the general election.

His age could hold him back from clinching president, but he's a ticket balancer to basically every candidate by being young, Hispanic, complementary on select issues, an experienced presence in Congress, etc.",1,0,1442493338,1444727683

cv6g4tx,0,t1_cv6f58c,imrightandyoutknowit,"Sure, but not in 2016. I'm unfamiliar with Florida state law over filing deadlines and such so I don't know if he *can't*, but Rubio seems pretty committed to the presidential campaign so I don't think he wants to drop out to run for re-election, or any other office. The two other freshman Senators are different. Rand Paul will drop out sooner rather than later because he has no chance at the presidency and wants to win re-election. Ted Cruz can lose and still run for re-election in 2018.",1,0,1442620517,1444727683

I have to add though there is a very important reason for this.  That audience was most definitely hand picked in his favor and against Donald Trump.  He could hardly get a word out of his mouth without the room bursting into applause. One of the biggest cheers of the night came after his line ""my brother kept us safe"", in defending GWB's response to 9/11. I think he really benefited from the room obviously being on his side.",3,0,1442498577,1444727683
cv4oqn0,1,t3_3lahtr,HollandGW215,"I honestly thought Bush had a rough night. He really tried to be high energy but he came off awkward. He is just not good in public. His interview with Colbert was also super awkward. He looked very nervous.


He had some good quips with Trump but you could tell he (and everyone else) was advised not to go after Trump. Even Carly in her response to Trump (about her saying ""all women heard that"") was fairly neutral. She should have come out swinging but she gave a classy response because antagonizing trump is just suicide. Also Carly is a misogynist and crazy. ",2,0,1442499555,1444727683
