cv5ik32,1,t3_3ldvff,GB88,"Yes and no. Statistics help us compare based on population but don't factor in the ""why."" Part of the problem when comparing countries is that you have a Statistician explaining numbers while the Anthropologist isn't present to explain the history or problems behind those numbers.  For example, all those countries you listed have less crime...but crime in the USA is very different from crime in those countries due to laws, poverty, where the crime takes place etc. It's not fair but Stats isn't about fairness. It's about understanding. They calculate and say ""holy crap there is a problem here"" and it's up to Anthropologist, Psychologist and Sociologist to figure out why there is a problem (or if it is a problem at all) but are often ignored by someone trying to tell you what they think that problem is and how to solve it.

cv5uts1,1,t3_3ldvff,EchelonHD,"The Northern European countries are the most affluent but they are very small populations. Norway, in particular, is a horrible comparison due to its oil wealth.

As for Western European countries, there isn't as strong a case to follow their lead as many on Reddit suggest. Some of the larger European states like France and Spain suffer from high unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. Of course, Germany fares well. Its a mixed bag.

Basically, a lot of people are focusing only on the negatives while the positives of the United States are frequently overlooked. The US leads in many areas (and not just military). For example, the tech sector in the US is superior to that of European states. (Think Apple, Google, Microsoft vs. Nokia.)

The US has many flaws like outrageous cost of higher education and healthcare; but, before we jump on any socialist economic model, the costs need to be properly assessed.

Maybe the argument is that the way the U.S economy is structured isn't really as beneficial as it could be.

Are you saying good public education isn't available because of massive urban populations? Well Japan and Germany seem to be doing something right.

>We can have free healthcare though. Please, you be the first volunteer to pay 50% federal taxes every year.

You don't have to pay 50% in federal taxes every year to have affordable healthcare for all Americans. Right now, America pays more for healthcare than other developed countries and the current tax rate in many of those countries isn't up to 50%. Neither is it 50% right now in spite of the massive expenditure.

>Funny how nobody mentions the high suicide rates and depression in countries like Sweden. Almost like an overbearing government that limits your freedom is unhealthy.

America has more suicide rates and depression than many of those countries. What's worse is that in America, they're more likely to be untreated.",1,0,1442652922,1444727290

I view illegal immigration and cultural differences as mostly wedge issues that get paraded out by both parties in order to avoid dealing with the country's actual problems, like massive economic inequality, a defunct democratic process, and a needlessly interventionist foreign policy propped up by a military industrial complex.

In this light, we do have some important differences with countries like Norway and Japan, but they appear to mutable versus static ones, i.e., you can't really make a country culturally homogeneous, but you can make it more democratic.",0,0,1442559268,1444727290
