Obviously, these people believe that tattoos and drugs will make them happier than financial restraint and fiscal responsibility.  I can understand that.  Having money in the bank never made me happy but spending money almost always feels good.   The other side of the coin is what makes people UNhappy. Being broke makes people unhappy.   So spending money is something that makes you happy and unhappy.  Don't be so hard on these people, it's not as simple as you make it out to be. We're all just doing the best we can to be happy and hopefully learning it better as we go. ",8,0,1442710460,1444726500

I think in general people don't understand how interest and inflation impacts them.   Nor do they understand how a minor consistent cost can add up in the long run.  $5 a day for coffee turns into a $1825 a year expense.

When it comes to managing their money they are, as a group, the biggest idiots you'll ever see. They get their $1000 check on the 3rd and in about a week they're broke.

cv7bwdw,1,t3_3llux0,CompactedConscience,"I worked retail in school as recently as last year. The poor people that I worked with were pretty frugal. Most of them were also going to school. Almost all of them wanted more hours than corporate would give them. Many of them worked two jobs. If you added up the average amount of school work and work-work the average person at that job did, it would easily clear 55 hours a week. An unexpected expense over a few hundred dollar would bankrupt almost anyone working there. 

Some of them spent money on the occasional beer, video game, or baseball/concert ticket, but I don't think that is unforgivable. You would go insane with absolutely no vices. ",9,0,1442701637,1444726500

In short, that article describes how a poor black woman gets ahead by signaling with her dress and accessories that she's a step above the mass of other poor people:

> How do you put a price on the double-take of a clerk at the welfare office who decides you might not be like those other trifling women in the waiting room and provides an extra bit of information about completing a form that you would not have known to ask about? What is the retail value of a school principal who defers a bit more to your child because your mother’s presentation of self signals that she might unleash the bureaucratic savvy of middle class parents to advocate for her child?

I assume your point is that since they're bad with money, that they don't deserve government help. Well, they have jobs so they probably don't get any assistance.

cv7flrg,0,t1_cv7ebfu,Mrs_Frisby,"Its an argument used both to oppose and support a welfare state.

In opposition the jist of it is ""These people deserve to suffer because they are dumb"".

In support the jist of it is, ""We need to set out social safety nets because lots of people are dumb"".  

I come down on the ""support"" side because dumb people have children and it isn't the children's fault that their parents are dumb.  Children should neither be held down nor raised up by their parent's achievements but rather be given equal opportunity to succeed or fail on their own merits.  

This is, IMO, central to the mythology of America.  We started as a giant middle finger extended to socially immobile societies where your position was determined primarily by your birth.  Places with entrenched aristocracies and formal serfdom.  Self determination, rather than familial determination, is central to this world view.

People who earn more have more expendable income.

It isn't necessarily a matter of most(?) waiters suck at managing their money. They vote with their money on what they value. So instead of going on vacation they get a video game, who's to say that is a mistake? And even if it could be demonstrated to be a mistake, it should be plainly obvious one can afford to be unwise with one's money when one has more of it. I know underemployed college grads who are content to work under their pay grade because it affords them leisure time. The cost associated with that may be high, but for someone with a family to raise it may be worth it to them, even if they complain about not having money to eat out as much.",1,0,1442728527,1444726500
