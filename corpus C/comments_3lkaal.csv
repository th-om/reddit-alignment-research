Yes, when health care costs go up so does Medicare/Medicaid costs. Nor do Medicare and Medicaid handle the same sub populations. Your comparison tells you nothing.

It is simply math that shows that insurance is cheaper with the larger population. Of course if there are big differences between populations then the cost of *one of the populations* would be lower than the average. But the average of 10 sub populations is going to have a higher^1 variance than treating it as one population.

I can try to show you the math or point you to it. But this is simply math, not ideology. Insurance exists to minimize variation. For a give population the variation will be lower for the whole population than for the sum of the variation of the sub populations.

You seem confused about the definition of the word ""outcome"".

There's no wait at all for anything important.  Waiting times in Canada are for essentially frivolous procedures only; things like ""I have a vague pain in my back"".  If you have an urgent injury that needs any medical procedure or diagnostic, it will happen immediately.  If you have a vague pain in your back, it will happen when they can fit you in, which may be weeks later.  Medical resources are prioritized by need.

And for a large percentage of the U.S. population who are uninsured or who can't afford procedures even with insurance, wait times are infinite, even for urgent, necessary procedures.  If you can't pay for it, you aren't getting an MRI, no matter how necessary it is.  This isn't true in Canada as no one is uninsured.
