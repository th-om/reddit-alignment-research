But look man, I'm not here to convince you whether or not the [models are solid](http://www.nber.org/papers/w6095) because they are whether you believe it or not.

But your position is exactly my point - it seem more intuitive to believe that the lost jobs and lower wages are not worth it.

However, Job loss and lower wages are only a short term thing. Free trade has nothing to do with employment in the end. Jobs aren't static - the economy is dynamic, constantly shifting around. [One job moved overseas doesn't mean we are out 1 less job in America.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy) If that we're true, we'd be at a much higher unemployment rate than 5.5% which is pretty good all things considered.

I'll let the guy who won the nobel prize in New Trade Theory [explain it best back in 1996:](https://hbr.org/1996/01/a-country-is-not-a-company&cm_sp=Article-_-Links-_-Top%20of%20Page%20Recirculation)

>Moreover, beyond this indisputable point of arithmetic lies the question of what limits the overall number of jobs available. Is it simply a matter of insufficient demand for goods? Surely not, except in the very short run. It is, after all, easy to increase demand. The Federal Reserve can print as much money as it likes, and it has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to create an economic boom when it wants to. Why, then, doesn’t the Fed try to keep the economy booming all the time? Because it believes, with good reason, that if it were to do so—if it were to create too many jobs—the result would be unacceptable and accelerating inflation. In other words, the constraint on the number of jobs in the United States is not the U.S. economy’s ability to generate demand, from exports or any other source, but the level of unemployment that the Fed thinks the economy needs in order to keep inflation under control.

>That is not an abstract point. During 1994, the Fed raised interest rates seven times and made no secret of the fact that it was doing so to cool off an economic boom that it feared would create too many jobs, overheat the economy, and lead to inflation. Consider what that implies for the effect of trade on employment. Suppose that the U.S. economy were to experience an export surge. Suppose, for example, that the United States agreed to drop its objections to slave labor if China agreed to buy $200 billion worth of U.S. goods. What would the Fed do? It would offset the expansionary effect of the exports by raising interest rates; thus any increase in export-related jobs would be more or less matched by a loss of jobs in interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as construction. Conversely, the Fed would surely respond to an import surge by lowering interest rates, so the direct loss of jobs to import competition would be roughly matched by an increased number of jobs elsewhere.

>Even if we ignore the point that free trade always increases world imports by exactly as much as it increases world exports, there is still no reason to expect free trade to increase U.S. employment, nor should we expect any other trade policy, such as export promotion, to increase the total number of jobs in our economy. When the U.S. secretary of commerce returns from a trip abroad with billions of dollars in new orders for U.S. companies, he may or may not be instrumental in creating thousands of export-related jobs. If he is, he is also instrumental in destroying a roughly equal number of jobs elsewhere in the economy. The ability of the U.S. economy to increase exports or roll back imports has essentially nothing to do with its success in creating jobs.

>Needless to say, this argument does not sit well with business audiences. (When I argued on one business panel that the North American Free Trade Agreement would have no effect, positive or negative, on the total number of jobs in the United States, one of my fellow panelists—a NAFTA supporter—reacted with rage: **“It’s comments like that that explain why people hate economists!”**) The job gains from increased exports or losses from import competition are tangible: You can actually see the people making the goods that foreigners buy, the workers whose factories were closed in the face of import competition. The other effects that economists talk about seem abstract. And yet if you accept the idea that the Fed has both a jobs target and the means to achieve it, you must conclude that changes in exports and imports have little effect on overall employment.",3,0,1443107103,1444724724

cvcliub,1,t3_3m5z70,Baratheon_Economist,"Note: I'm British, but follow US politics rather closely. 

I consider myself ideologically a liberal, although in the last general election I voted for the Conservative Party. When it comes to people I know, there's about a 50/50 split on whether or not they consider me a liberal or a conservative; personally, I just call myself a liberal with a conservative attitude. 

I should probably name a couple of things I actually agree with Sanders on, just for the sake of balance and intellectual honesty:

- Tax on carbon emissions. 

- Support of Israel. 

- I like his stuff on getting big money out of politics, although I'm not nearly as knowledgeable in that arena as I should be. 

However, there's a lot to disagree with when it comes to Sanders' other proposals: 

- **$1tn investment in infrastructure**

This is essentially just the ideological reverse of Ron Paul promising to cut $1tn from the federal budget. Best estimates I've seen for recommended infrastructure spending is a further [$165bn](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/americas/us_game_changers). 

- **American jobs are killed by free trade**

This is [egregiously incorrect](https://hbr.org/1996/01/a-country-is-not-a-company). 

- **Wealth and income inequality**

[Income inequality](http://www.nber.org/papers/w15351.pdf) in the US has been substantially exaggerated. Indeed, when people think of inequality they tend to think of a cross-sectional 'snapshot' of inequality, which doesn't capture lifetime effects; people don't remain poor forever. Labour's share of national income has remained remarkably stable over the past several decades, while the transitory increase in [capital's share](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Spring-2015/2015a_rognlie.pdf?la=en) from ~01 onwards is probably due to the housing boom. 

Sanders also likes to talk about how middle-income Americans have been stagnant for the past three decades, despite the fact that middle America has experienced a [30pc real gain](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/the-region/has-middle-america-stagnated) in total compensation between 1975 and 2005. 

While inequality is certainly an issue, it can be frustrating to see people talk about CEOs and the decline of unions. The most recent evidence I've seen (I'll try and find the NBER paper) suggests CEO pay is not primarily the result of rent-seeking, and while collective bargaining is important I don't think it's a seminal factor in the low-income decile doing poorly. Inequality is caused--mainly--by a process known as [skill-biased technical change](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_0IAlhdDH2FoRDrm), wherein technology increases the productivity of some workers more than other's. The solution to this is more investment in human capital (basically, education) not bringing the rich down with nasty rhetoric. 

- **$15/hr minimum wage**

Nope. Not a good idea; the highest federal minimum wage that the literature supports is $10/hr--see: [Dube](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2014/06/19_hamilton_policies_addressing_poverty/state_local_minimum_wage_policy_dube.pdf). A lot of people seem to think this is Sanders' starting position, and he's going to use it to negotiate downwards, but I don't buy it. 

- **Taking on Wall Street**

It probably is the case that banks are too big; the literature I've seen doesn't suggest any economies of scale above moderately sized banks. However, the solution is definitely not to break them up; small, undiversified banks are acutely at risk when it comes to financial shocks, and this has indeed been an idiosyncratic risk of the US financial system for most of its history. The key is to restructure the regulation of the financial system--especially when it comes to TBTF institutions--not break it up.

I agree with a lot of your points, but I have to disagree with you here.  Admittedly, I'm biased, as Bernie's stance on ""free"" (special-interest managed) trade is the only economic position I agree with him on.

The benefits are very clear and the costs, while they certainly exist for certain groups in any society that embraces a liberal trading regime, are negligible. Protectionism on the other hand has been shown to be harmful to economic growth and general prosperity.

Economically I am center right, I do not support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

This is where stupidly high costs for asprin in hospitals comes from. ACA does not fix this at all.On the other hand, while socialized medicine works in Europe, we must ask how much of the R&D burden does the US bear by not paying sub market prices for drugs? How much of this will be hurt by socialized medicine above and beyond when Europe did it?

The reason I say I am center right, and not right on economics is that I understand that if we just got the government severely out of  the economy that it would fuck things over a lot. We have built a system that helps the middle class and rich, and has left a lot of the poor behind. Simply letting the economy be more of itself freer from government intrusion will simply exacerbate this downward cycle of poverty. Which yes, is partially centered around race.

I'll vote for him in the primary because I don't support Hillary's center-right foreign policy and I think the democratic party is in desperate need of a shake-up, but I don't really want him to be president. ",0,0,1443117072,1444724728

He has shown that he can't or won't compromise. If he can't do anything in congress why would he suddenly be able to as president?

He also makes winning the general election for the democrats far far far far far far far more difficult. He can't accomplish his no compromise far left agenda anyway so to gamble so much on a guy who can't win anyway is foolish.

I don't think Sanders is a socialist and I don't think he will be able to help the workers, and that his policies are biased towards whites.  At the very least I want someone who can get stuff done, and try to actually solve for racial inequality.  That's Hillary.  Bonus points because women get representation.

Hillary is an imperialist warmongerer though. But the USA is a capitalist imperialist hegemony anyway, and there is no way to stop imperialism. Even Obama couldn't. So it isn't a factor for me anymore.",-3,0,1443097840,1444724728
