3l3207,"Is there a good, conservative way to do healthcare reform without outlawing insurance/non-upfront pricing?",76,slam7211,"A lot of conservatives talk a lot about free market healthcare, and how it will help our healthcare situation. However, the reality is that, consumers can only really act like rational consumers if they know the price of things up front, and those prices are actually connected directly to the services they are about to receive. In reality the modern healthcare consumer sees mostly either costs up to their deductible and copays, or the ""real"" cost of care when a service is not covered. This price is artificially inflated by care givers because they know that they need to negotiate the price with insurance companies so they have to have a price way above cost so that when they negotiate down they still at least break even.

This system in effect prevents consumers from self regulating the market because they never see real costs. The only fix I see for this is basically the outlawing of insurance in healthcare, which is politically never going to happen. Given that is there any real way to do a market based system?

Note: Liberals please do not just start going off how markets and healthcare do not work. I understand, and somewhat agree with that position, but that is not the point of this post.
