3k9zfn,"George Takei responded to the Kim Davis story by posting on social media "" If she had denied marriage certificates to an interracial couple, would people cheer her? Is this a legitimate comparison to it?",241,Mattie_Smith,"I would like to avoid Kim Davis as being the subject of this discussion and place the focus instead on how far religious freedom goes and what factors may determine the outcome of a story such as this. That being said, she is the best example to use, so I will mention her a lot.

I am not sure if someone would be able to refuse an interracial couple a marriage license due to religious beliefs, assuming the same set of reasons given by Kim Davis (mainly having her name on the license as the major problem). I would argue that George Takei's comparison poses a legitimate argument. I think such a decision would be ruled against the said license distributor, and rather aggressively. Obviously this is because this could be attributed to racism, and America has more or less officially declared it to be ""wrong"".

**Are decisions like these based purely on the context of the cultural times?** The example being that many still don't want same-sex marriage in america, and the attempt to accommodate Kim Davis shows sympathy, but a different outcome would be expected if the same happened in fifty+ years  (assuming that  America, christians included, would have a better outlook on same-sex marriage as it now does with interracial marriage).
**What other factors would affect such a decision as a collective, rather than the individual events?**",71,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3k9zfn/george_takei_responded_to_the_kim_davis_story_by/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441823344,1444731098
