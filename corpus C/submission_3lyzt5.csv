3lyzt5,Are welfare programs and collectivism compatible with increased immigration and multiculturalism?,39,passwordgoeshere,"Some points-

1) If the US takes in lots of new low-wage immigrants working potentially dangerous jobs, is this a major contributor to expensive health care costs for everyone?  

2) If most immigrants are people from more socially restrictive cultures, doesn’t that make it harder to drive social progress for women and lgbt people? 

3) If everyone’s culture is kept distinct as a faster immigration process allows, won’t people feel less connected to other groups, making it harder to share public spaces and harder to make agreements on public policies?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lyzt5/are_welfare_programs_and_collectivism_compatible/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442949095,1444725233
