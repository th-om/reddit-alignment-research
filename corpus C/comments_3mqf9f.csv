*Prison Reform for non-violent offenses (minor drug charges and such).  

*De-escalate our involvement overseas because he is willing to admit that America causes more problems than it solves.

*Tax Reform.  Our current system is terrible and favors the rich who can afford to take advantage of the loopholes.

*Get government out of marriage -- yes please.

*Get government out of surveillance -- yes please.

*Make congress approve acts of war -- yes please.

I know for a fact that he is debriefed at least daily on all military movements and operations. There is no way a military operation happens without presidential approval. It's what makes GWbush complicit in the mess that was military conflicts from '01-'09.

But it sounds like you're looking at the candidates based on where they stand on the issues, so I would check out [On The Issues](http://www.ontheissues.org/default.htm) - the site breaks down each candidate and where they stand on a variety of issues based on previous quotes, voting history, and scoring from different third party groups.",5,0,1443471993,1444722731
cvh8ja3,1,t3_3mqf9f,Grundelwald,"Obviously this will depend on who you ask, but as a non-republican,  Rand Paul makes the most sense to me. He actually talks about our aggressive foreign policy as a problem, which is something any other republican will deny. He was the only one at the last debate who was not foaming at the mouth to start another war. 

On domestic issues he is certainly conservative, but he is pretty reasonable and makes a lot of sense. For example, idk if I agree with a flat tax, but simplifying the tax code? Yes please. I think neutral contracts for marriage makes a lot of sense too. 

He is perhaps the best candidate (in either party) for rolling back the drug war. He's also seemingly the only candidate who cares about our privacy rights and would do something about the NSA's surveillance. ",4,0,1443469502,1444722731
cvhhp9n,1,t3_3mqf9f,KabIoski,"Not considering voting for a republican, but now that I think about it, probably Chris Christie. Hear me out...

He's one of maybe two candidates that I think could come out of a debate with Hillary or Bernie and not look like a puppet for the 1%. If the Republican debates they've already held were limited to four people and Christie was one, I think he would have come out the winner, instead of being buried in an avalanche of TrumpMania. Unlike just about every other candidate he has both experience and a proven track record of being able to work in a bipartisan fashion. The RNC is currently driving toward an ideological cliff with a brick on the accelerator, and Christie's centrist leanings could keep them from going over.  

He's had a few notable scandals, but so has Jeb. The only thing that makes BridgeGate a bigger deal than Jeb's ties with say, InnoVida or the St. John's River waste dumping scandal, is the fact that it's so obvious. With BridgeGate, the motive was clearly retributive, and it's something people can wrap their heads around. 

I don't think he has a chance at this point, because he's relegated to about 4 minutes of airtime per debate, and only if he wants to yell at someone, but there's a reason why MSNBC started going hard after Christie before the primary battle even began.",3,0,1443484004,1444722731
cvhkzui,1,t3_3mqf9f,4mg1n3,"IMHO Donald Trump is looking like an increasingly better option every time he makes a move. From a rational perspective, he is experienced in working with politicians, studied economics in college, is a successful leader, an author, and appears honest. Not to mention, he is a change of pace from the regular career politicians. Some of his policy proposals are disagreeable, but nobody is perfect. Overall, I think he is the most qualified to actually LEAD the nation.

From an ideological perspective, I would have to say that Rand Paul would be the best option. He is probably the most intelligent GOP candidate. However, he isn't very popular in his caucus, and he would not likely be a very effective of leader given America's  current circumstances.

I would say that John Kasich and Ben Carson are the X factors. Possibly good options, but less likely to land the nomination. John Kasich is too normal of a human being, and Ben Carson lacks a commanding presence.",1,0,1443489415,1444722731
