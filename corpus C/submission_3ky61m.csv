3ky61m,"Marijuana, and users of other illegal substances, does the fact that people are dying because of your lifestyle give you pause?",59,littlebitsoffluff,"Got a lot of drugs coming in from South America, Mexico, and so forth. The drugs are illegal. Law enforcement officials on either side of the border, and not to mention families and innocents caught in the middle of the drug wars fought by gangs and cartels (see http://iz1a.com/html/warning_to_americans_per_forei.html; warning, graphic murders) are being killed as a result of the demand in place for drugs in the United States. 

Marijuana, to pick one example, may be a perfectly safe drug to use in terms of health, but as it currently stands, violence occurs as a result of its importation. 

Obviously one solution is to legalize drugs, but until that happens, your partaking of illegal drugs helps fuel violence/homicides that are a result of illegal smuggling and fights over turf.

Does that give you pause? Do you feel complicit as a result?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ky61m/marijuana_and_users_of_other_illegal_substances/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442259320,1444728856
