And if they were nominally Christian but lived a more secular life, then I'd be most likely to vote for them.

Similarly, I wouldn't vote for an imam unless they had serious political chops that countered that. And I would vote for a guy who just happened to be Muslim but not that observant. But in each case, the Christian would have a lower threshold for me than the Muslim. Because even though I belong to neither religion, I like and respect Christianity more than Islam.

In fact, he took it a step further and said, effectively, that he wouldn't support any Muslim for the presidency, with the subtext being that all Muslims are not qualified for the office.

There's different ways the word can be used. Obviously Muslims are not constitutionally disqualified. On a personal level, Carson thinks they are because he thinks that he is most qualified and, since he's not a Muslim, he's not advocating for one to be elected. So I don't see a problem.

> I literally know one person only who thinks gays deserve to be punished

A very large number of Christians actively attempt to ostracize gays from society by seeking legislation to limit their acceptance and participation in societal structures. How is that not a form of punishment?

You assume that because I criticize the actions of Christians, I must not be Christian. That's a bit presumptuous, isn't it?

Incorrect. The problem with Carson's comment is that he states that a Muslim shouldn't be president simply because he/she is a Muslim. Substitute Muslim with any other faith (or non-faith), and the statement is equally bigoted. 

I wouldn't vote for the hypotetical Muslim, pro-life, anti-gay rights candidate. I wouldn't vote for him because he/she is pro-life and anti-gay rights. I wouldn't care about the fact that he/she is Muslim. In my mind, this hypothetical candidate is not substantially different from Mike Huckabee. Change Muslim to Protestant, and boom: Huckabee. 

> It is a secular position.

No it's not. A secular position would be deciding whether to support someone based upon their policy positions, not basing your decision on whether you agree or disagree with the religion they choose to follow.
