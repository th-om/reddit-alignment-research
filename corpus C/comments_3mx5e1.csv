In general? Yes, of course.

That perform abortion procedures? I'm not sure of any, but I would guess there are some.

Essentially the argument is simply that the restrictions currently in place aren't an effective way of preventing abortion procedures. 

Frankly, I think this is the sort of argument that is lukewarm to a fault. I really believe ending abortion, and this measure comes off as a bit half-hearted to me. Either ban abortions or don't, but don't use the federal budget as a means to express moral judgement.

>They want you to believe that this is about abortion, but the problem is that the money in question goes to the wide array of preventive services that Planned Parenthood offersâ€”from contraception to cancer screeningsâ€”that are not abortion. Since contraception funding remains popular in the U.S., Republicans have been pushing the ""money is fungible"" line, most recently used by Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner in an antiâ€“Planned Parenthood congressional hearing. It implies that while Planned Parenthood is supposed to be getting money for contraception, it's actually going to subsidize abortion.

>**The problem is that it doesn't work that way.** To understand why, it's useful to take a look at how Planned Parenthood operates and where its money comes from.

>The most important thing to remember is that Planned Parenthood clinics operate like any other medical clinic. A patient comes in, gets some services, and is billed according to what services she got. Some patients are eligible for federal money to offset the costs of some services. This works in a couple of different ways.

>For patients who are on Medicaid, the process is the same as with any insurance program. The patient's bill is sent to her insurer, in this case Medicaid. They pay for any services that are covered and she is on the hook for the rest. Since Medicaid does not cover abortion, any Medicaid patients who get an abortion have to pay the price in full, in cash.

>Many conservatives have argued that Medicaid patients should simply go elsewhere for care. The problem is that many private doctors will refuse to take them on, because Medicaid reimbursements are so low. Planned Parenthood, being a non-profit, is more open to helping Medicaid patients.
