3nf2vi,Economists: What do you hate less?,31,PerfectSociety,"I'm honestly just curious. Economists: I know most of you dislike both Tariffs and Corporate taxes. However, If you had the option to replace the Corporate Tax completely with a Uniform Tariff (same rate for all products) on all imports (with exemptions for raw materials and natural resources), would you do it? Assume that the revenue from the Uniform Tariff would be equivalent to what the Federal Government now gets from the Corporate Tax. Ignore the WTO restrictions and political feasibility for the sake of this question.
