Hillary's server was set up to use in place of her hillary.clinton@whitehouse.gov address **which was only supposed to be used for unclassified communication**.

This was the most objectionably concrete thing the Republicans found in the Benghazi investigation they could attack Secretary Clinton over.

2) Secretary Clinton's explanation was that she didn't want to have to carry multiple devices while traveling. That sounds like bullshit, especially considering she frequently carried multiple devices and bragged about it. Still *plausible,* but unlikely.

3) The more likely explanation? She didn't want her emails subject to FOIA requests, which is scummy and unethical but not technically illegal.

Well certainly it's partisan in the sense that I saw Obama make an ultimatum, follow through on it, and then get called out for not following through on it, so I'm left with the conclusion that the Republicans simply wanted him to do more, and the only thing more he could have done would have been direct military action for regime change.

I'm not sure what date you're setting for the initial use, but the Ghouta attacks in August 2013 were the first major confirmed usage and the widely acknowledged point at which the ""Red line"" was crossed.

That's an odd thing to say. Even if you think Obama doesn't care about conservative attacks on him, it doesn't somehow make the pressure disappear or remove it from the public discussion, which is what you seem to be trying to do. 

Yes he is under pressure from regional allies to attack as well.

Obama is under pressure to intervene in Syria from regional allies.  He is also under domestic pressure from the US population to not get involved.  Pressure is pressure, it's not all one sided.  I don't want him to engage in the Syrian conflict either, but he set a red line and appeared weak because of it.  There's grounds for criticism in that.

I do not think Obama should invade ISIS either, he doesn't have the fortitude to see a campaign out and it would be a disaster.
