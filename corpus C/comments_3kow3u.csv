Now, the guys over at Ford know their cars suck. If we let the Japanese come over and sell their cars, the American people will start buying them and leave Ford in the dust. But since America has protectionist policies, the tariff is too high for the Japanese to be profitable, and Ford gets to continue making crappy cars and cackling at their captive market instead of actually making decent cars that can compete with the Japanese. The same is true in Japan with their terrible clothing designers, who don't have to fear American fashion. This extremely small subset of the population is making life worse for everyone just so they don't have to innovate or put effort into their products.

It is almost never the case that all American-made products in a particular industry are crap while all foreign-made products are good. Both foreign- and domestic-made products are good in some ways and bad in others. Sometimes, yes the foreign product is better and it's nice to have that affordable. The real problem, however, is competition in price, not quality. Foreign countries often pay lower wages, so a product that's made in America might be roughly equal quality as a product made in China, but the labor needed to make it in China is 1/3 the cost. So obviously people would buy the cheap foreign product, those American companies will go out of business, and we'll lose those jobs. The textile industry is a perfect example of this. The solution is to put tariffs on imports to balance out that difference in labor costs. Now the difference in labor costs is offset, so the domestic-made product is competing with the foreign-made product only on quality. The American workers don't get to slack off and make a completely crappy product, but they now have a chance to compete because their price isn't being undercut by cheap foreign labor.

cuzchoa,0,t1_cuz81v0,spoofdaddy,"This is a very good hypothetical of how free market economics can benefit consumers, but I think I will try to tackle the opposing case.

Free trade is important for consumer satisfaction, however it has a variety of negative effects. One large issue is that it tends to favor those with wealth over those without. Like /u/minorsaint said, China can produce products far more cheaply than the US, and this can drive prices (and quality, as mentioned) down to make other products competitive. The ""race to the bottom"" effect not only hampers the quality of products, but also the growth of the small companies that operate with very limited profit margin. That is why tariffs exist, in order to protect growing companies from, say, a state-owned Chinese enterprise or even a [new and developing country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1789) from cheaper labor and products from abroad. A modern example could be drawn from the Hollywood movie industry bidding special effects to a huge number of suppliers and choosing the cheapest one. These small (usually Asiatic) companies are then driven very hard to produce the SFX, sometimes to the point of bankruptcy, no matter the success of the [movie](http://www.totalbankruptcy.com/bankruptcy-news/bankruptcy-information/special-effects-company-800835990.aspx).

Another issue is with deregulation of markets, which is closely associated with free trade. Deregulation of markets and market entities like banks typically creates very low borrowing rates. This can be good for the growth of economies, but it is especially good for the growth of the financial sector of any economy. Cheap borrowing means cheap lending, and what can end up happening (as it did in 2008) is a decoupling of financial assets from real assets. In essence, the growth of the financial sector far outstrips the real-world growth, which then creates huge bubbles that have no real-world value. Think of all of this growth as a building, where the base is the real assets such as factories and homes and the like, and the financial assets are the stories above. If you add too many stories to the building without widening the base, the whole thing could fall over. Free market economics likes the idea of deregulation, and the ""invisible hand of the market"" is commonly referred to as some sort of controlling factor. The reality is that with very few rules controlling a market, a large amount of instability can be introduced very easily. ",8,0,1442091688,1444729757

You're also ignoring how tax incentives are the biggest reason for why VFX companies are constantly relocated, or outsourced. The Life of Pi people have spoken a lot about this.

Low borrowing rates are produced by the government, not deregulation. In 2008 banks increasingly had the incentive to make long-term amortizing loans secured by long-term assets because the threat of bank runs has been taken away by increases in FDIC deposit insurance. The Securities and Exchange Commission decided in four years earlier, in 2004 to allow banks to triple their leverage ratios (the ratio measuring the amount of risk to capital), which appeared benign at the time.

If you cant survive out in the market because someone else is doing what you're trying to do more efficiently, you should not kick out those that are more efficient. You should redirect your resources into something you can do more efficiently. Have you ever heard of David Ricardo? Of comparative advantage? 

Also, driving costs up and limiting competition does not increase skill. The person making the guitars for WalMart is also likely someone named Chang, not Smith. If we assume that there's a dude, sitting at walmart, making shitty guitars, that still doesn't give him the right skill, or equipment. It's much harder to make a really good guitar, and they're sold to a different audience. The demand for shitty guitars has very little to do with the demand for expensive guitars. Flood the market with shitty guitars, and the top of the line Ibanez guitars won't be affected, which kind of fucks up your argument completely.

Mr. Walmart employee is an idiot for trying to emulate the bigger guys. That's not how you succeeded in the market. I'm not sure why you so want people to be able to waste resources like that either. You also missed my point. When it comes to high-end merchandise, it doesn't really matter where they are made. PRS, Gibson, and Custom Shop Fenders are all made in US. Ibanez guitars are made in Japan. It's generally low quality shit that gets made in China or similar places. Products that are standardized and mass produced.

German politicians were too busy bickering with who has what power to regulate what and what not. The U.S. Laws were a way for corporations to create minimum standards for themselves and squeeze out competition. Japan, a neo-corporatist state whose politicians don't even bother hiding the fact that they'd corporate whores protected industry as much as possible. They just got out of ww2 and needed economic growth. That's understandable. They passed purely symbolic environmental laws that industry usually was as to skirt. The individual citizens were so fed up that industry had to negotiate with the local government just so they could open up shop. The Japanese environmental movement was 100% grassroots, yet it was the most effective for both industry and people.


Industry liked it because it was faster to deal with local government than national government and the people always got a deal that was good enough for them to accept, otherwise the towns wouldn't let them open a factory.

It is perhaps not literally *all* the data, but as a first approximation it's quite close. In contrast there's no amount of conditioning that can produce the conclusion that ""the evidence is entirely one-sided"" in the other direction.

I haven't read that article nor this critique (nor anything from either Chang or Easterly), but thanks for the pointer. I read a bit, until this:

> This is what Mlodinow calls ""confirmation bias."" When the evidence is mixed, we tend to select the parts of the evidence that confirm what we already believe. Pro-traders such as Anne Krueger, the chief economist of the World Bank in the 1980s, noted that Korea's spectacular growth was based on heavy participation in global trade, and especially on the great success of Korean *exports*. Chang and other protectionists, in contrast, attribute Korea's performance to significant tariffs or quotas on *imports*.

..at which point I figured I must misunderstand the author completely, because this seems just outlandish. ""Wonderful free-trade exports on the one hand, and on the other hand significant tariffs on imports, so who's to say which policy is really better I wonder?"" I mean, maybe North Korea has imposed tariffs on exports at some point, and I suppose there exists restrictions on cultural/historical artifacts etc. in some countries, but this critique of ""confirmation bias"" makes zero sense.

Furthermore Easterly seems to repeatedly make the argument that there are examples of protectionist states that haven't developed well, which just betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the argument (or elementary logic).",-1,0,1442099103,1444729765

The same goes for your comparison to scientific medicine, to pretend that free trade economics (or even the field of economics in general, beyond what is simply mathematics), is somehow even in the same realm is just not true.

Right. Like I have been saying, there are almost no instances of industrialization under a free trade regime.

In the sense that after industrialization and building competitive industry, you'll want exports and ""free trade"" and you'll certainly see higher growth rates.

* goods become cheaper and better over time.

* from economic freedom is a requisite for political freedom, so places with free markets usually end up expanding individual liberties (more on this in cons). 

* free trade creates peace and influences culture more than any government official could ever dream of. From a politician's point of view, why wage an expensive war for resource x, which eventually turns your peoe against you and endangers your power, when you can trade for resource x?)

* individuals in a free market have the power to lead their own lives and improve (or not) them as they please. 

Cons:

* if someone else can do a better job than you, you are out of a job. ""better"" usually means cheaper at a good enough or equal quality.

* Capitalism is only an economic system. It is not a moral system. Free markets are a necessary for individual freedom, but it is not, in and of itself, all that is needed. Look at the right-wing dictatorships of South America. A healthy market depends on an educated population. 

* The last people that want free trade are means-owning capitalists, so they influence government to create laws and garrote that protect their industries ""in the name of the common worker"".
