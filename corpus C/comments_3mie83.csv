cvgc212,0,t1_cvf8vwx,Awesometom100,Those four butt heads all the time. Rush hated Bush for a long time in office so I doubt he would support the same kind of candidate as Gleen Beck who seems to be riding towards the Trump Stump.,2,0,1443397227,1444723366

They didn't lose because they lacked their own Bill Clinton in those cycles and they won't lose for that reason in 2016.

I'd be afraid of the electorate if *that* reason sways votes.",6,0,1443304035,1444723366
cvg2smq,0,t1_cvf6r7p,rikross22,"I will say bill Clinton did matter a lot in 2016, he went on full assault with the media and really helped motivate the party to get out to vote for Obama. His convention speech was great. ",1,0,1443382100,1444723366
cvfy0uh,0,t1_cvf6r7p,__Archipelago,"The electorate gets swayed by very poor reasons.  Obama and Bill are excellent orators, Bill and Biden are very likeable especially with Bill being out of the political scene for a while and Biden being viewed as an Uncle figure who makes a lot of gaffs.  This is really helpful because Clinton is viewed as a cold, unfeeling shark of a politician.",1,0,1443375004,1444723366

cvg0wgd,0,t1_cvf6spm,ScoobiusMaximus,Honestly Romney lost because he wasn't a great speaker and he doesn't connect with people. He won't be a huge asset to the republican candidate in swaying voters who weren't already republican. ,1,0,1443379332,1444723370
