Um, no, they didn't.  Are you just not paying attention, or what? 

The Senate and the House passed two different versions of the budget.  When that happens, the two chambers are required to enter conference committee to produce a reconciled bill, which is then voted on and passed in both houses - no bills can go to signature from the Prez until the same bill has been passed on both sides.  This is very standard stuff.

However, in this instance, the House refused to enter the reconciliation process.  They did so because the Senate version contained funding for PP and they knew their own caucus wouldn't ever approve a compromise that included that, and they didn't want to get into a high-stakes fight between the House and Senate during an election year.  So, they passed a CR until December 11th instead, which Obama did sign.  That's not a new budget, though.  So, no, the GOP has NOT passed a budget.  They skipped the hard part because it was inconvenient for them politically.

Please attempt to engage in civil discussion.  Backhanded insults are not appreciated and show you are unable to engage in rational discussion.

When we hit the debt ceiling we can't issue new debt and have to operate within the tax revenue as it comes in.

This is precisely wrong, there is no distinction between mandatory and discretionary payments in a default. The executive branch doesn't have the legal authority to prioritize payments, and the Treasury payment systems can't even do it.

No, that isn't true.  Just because its not codified that they have to prioritize does not mean that they can't prioritize payments.

This article has some congressmen on the record saying that we should hit the debt ceiling because it would be a ""great experiment"".  Many of these congressmen seem either unwilling to admit or don't understand that doing so would cause us to default on our debt.  

This is because our country functions on debt.  We issue bonds at a certain interest rate in order to receive new debt.  Basically as an example if you buy a $100 bond from the US government now they will pay you $101 in 5 years.  Obviously that is a little simplified. 

When we are having a surplus we can simply pay back these bonds when they come due, but when we are running a deficit we must issue more bonds in order to pay for the old ones that are now due.  by not raising the debt ceiling, you are telling the government they are limited to issuing a certain amount of debt, and hence a certain amount of bonds.  When you hit this cap on bonds aka the debt ceiling, you can no longer issue new bonds to pay for your old ones that are coming due and when this happens you can not fulfill your obligation to pay back the bonds on the date you said you would.  When you are unable to pay back the bonds you said you would on the date you said you would, you have effectively defaulted on your debt.


As for whether Obama is acting differently.

Raising the debt ceiling has never been a question in the past because congressmen understood that it was not something you goofed around with.  Debt is how a country functions and if you scare investors by defaulting on your debt for a few days, the interest rate on your debt will go up, making it much harder to borrow money.  We are talking about huge amounts of money here, and even a small change in interest rate can have huge repercussions on the size of your debt and deficit.  

Back in 2011 the Republicans got the idea that instead of just passing this very important piece of legislation like normal they would use it as a bargaining chip.  The ultimate bargaining chip.  They are saying do what we want or we will cause the country to default on its debt and ruin our economy.

Obama is calling their bluff and saying this has never been a bargaining chip, and we are not going to make it one now.  It is too important.  Pass the debt ceiling bill and raise the debt ceiling, and then we will talk about the budget.  They are two separate issues. 

Which they are the debt ceiling is about debt you have already incurred and whether you will pay it, while the budget is about how you will take on new debt in the coming year.  if you want to reduce the deficit and reduce the amount of debt you are taking on, the budget is the place to do that not the debt ceiling.

As far as I have seen Obama's procedure with the budget has been pretty normal.  He has proposed a budget and sent it to congress and then congress works from there.  The difference is republicans in congress have been unwilling to pass a budget unless it is exactly what they want, even shutting down the government over it.  When you are dealing with a hard negotiator like Republicans in congress, you have to show that you are equally unwilling to give ground.  It is like any negotiation.  In fact Obama offered multiple deals to Republicans where both parties would get some of what they wanted, but instead Republicans stuck to their guns and refused any compromise.  In the end after the Republicans did compromise, they ended up getting a worse deal than if they had just taken they original deal Obama had proposed.",3,0,1443810354,1444720674

>This article has some congressmen on the record saying that we should hit the debt ceiling because it would be a ""great experiment"". Many of these congressmen seem either unwilling to admit or don't understand that doing so would cause us to default on our debt.

First, its Huffington Post so you know its crap journalism.

Second, that's not what he said and you had to have not read it on purpose to state that. He specifically says that we wouldn't default on debt as we would pay it.

Please don't make up things to conceal the fact you made something up.  Just stop making false statements in the future.

cvm3i59,0,t1_cvly9vm,pjabrony,"> When we are having a surplus we can simply pay back these bonds when they come due, but when we are running a deficit we must issue more bonds in order to pay for the old ones that are now due. by not raising the debt ceiling, you are telling the government they are limited to issuing a certain amount of debt, and hence a certain amount of bonds. When you hit this cap on bonds aka the debt ceiling, you can no longer issue new bonds to pay for your old ones that are coming due and when this happens you can not fulfill your obligation to pay back the bonds on the date you said you would. When you are unable to pay back the bonds you said you would on the date you said you would, you have effectively defaulted on your debt.

Well, what if we, you know, actually paid for them? With money? Fire a bunch of government workers, cancel some contracts, etc., and used that money instead to pay the bonds?

You're acting like spending is set in stone, but the debt ceiling is just a paper formality. Both carry equal weight, the force of federal law. You just want spending to count for more because you like it.

When the economy depends on government spending, it's already fucked up. We need to wean it off of the government teat so that even if the budget doesn't pass, things in the private sector go smoothly.

Or we could just raise the debt ceiling and not make major changes to our economy that will almost undoubtedly have disastrous effects?!?!!??!??!???

Pardon me for geeking out like this, but, it's the same way RAID 1 is better than RAID 0. Less space, but increased speed and safety.
