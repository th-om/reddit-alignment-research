Her favorability numbers have actually gone *up* in the most recent polls.

It's not ""simple math"" you would have to analyze his name recognition and support over time so your 39% number was pulled figuratively out of your ass.

Yes, and I'm referring to your ""logic"" that Bernie's national polling numbers among democrats is bad even though it's out of a field of 7. By that logic, the Republicans are all doing terrible. You're ignoring how many people support is split between. It's completely ignorant.

>pulled figuratively out of your ass

No, my number was based on what percentage of those who showed familiarity with him in the latest polls supported him in the latest polls. It is coming directly out of the data.

>Her favorability numbers have actually gone up in the most recent polls.

Perhaps she has seen a temporary bump, but the trend is downward, and more importantly, her primary support numbers are down from over 60% previously. Meaning that the current 41-39 lead over Sanders with voters who are familiar with both of them could and probably will change. Because her numbers didn't go down do to people forgetting who she was.

Actually, I'm the only one between us who has talked about trends, lol. 

Clinton's trend in support is that she's gone from 60+ down to 40, while at the same time Sanders has gone from 1% to 26% in a very steady rise. 

Another trend is that Sanders was very unknown and is now more known but still unfamiliar and becoming more familiar. This trend can be seen in the data from polls that ask (1) about name recognition, (2) about favorability, and (3) ask voters to describe the candidate.

>the most recent poll in Iowa has Hillary up 21 points over Sanders with Biden in the race.

You're talking about the PPP poll, apparently. I was referencing the CBS news poll taken days before that one which had Sanders up 10 points. Neither of those are the most recent polls in Iowa, apparently. The most recent NBC/WSJ poll looks like this: 

Clinton: 33

Sanders: 28

Biden: 22

Plus or Minus 5.5%, by the way. 

RCP puts the average this month at Hillary up 6 points with about a 5.5% plus or minus. And the polling TREND is very clearly in Bernie's favor. So if you really want to get into a talk about the trend, we can do that. ",1,0,1443973368,1444719517
