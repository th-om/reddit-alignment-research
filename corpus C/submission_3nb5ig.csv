3nb5ig,"Can Boehner, McCarthy and the GOP Establishment avert a shutdown by December?",14,Kross_B,"With two months to go, plus the debt ceiling issue, both the GOP and Dems are waiting to see who blinks first regarding the latest budget impasse. Obama does not want another short-term CR and the Dems are pushing for a budget that meets some of their demands for higher spending on domestic services and such, which they know will be a difficult pill for the GOP to swallow.

From my perspective, the Dems are approaching this thinking no matter what happens, they walk out the winners. Either the GOP concedes to some of the Dems spending demands to avert a shutdown, which will elicit protest from the Tea Party faction thinking the Establishment has gotten emasculated by the President and the minority party in Congress. Or a shutdown occurs, the Dems wait until the blowback becomes too much for the GOP to stomach like last time and caves in, which results in a similar situation to the first, and the Dems strengthen their chances at retaining the White House thanks to the goldmine of attack ads that would ensue.

The Establishment knows this, and Boehner has a month to get something going for McCarthy to work on negotiating a deal. Boehner has the advantage in that as the outgoing Speaker, he can negotiate terms with the Dems without worrying about a Tea Party revolt. But he has only a month to do so and with the October recess and the debt ceiling issue coming forth, plus continued resistance from hardcore conservatives, he will need to make the most of this time.

IMO, the possibility of a shutdown is going to be one of, if not the deciding factor for the election. Can the GOP Establishment avert this to save the party from the inevitable backlash, or are their efforts futile to the point they should just write 2016 off and get a headstart on how to beat Hillary in four years?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nb5ig/can_boehner_mccarthy_and_the_gop_establishment/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443845425,1444719989
