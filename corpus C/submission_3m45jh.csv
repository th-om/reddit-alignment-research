3m45jh,Why don't conservatives get quizzed about Reagan more often?,12,nogare318,"I was watching Stephen Colbert's interview with Ted Cruz, and was struck by how tripped up Cruz seemed by questions regarding Reagan. Most conservatives talk a lot about Reagan, lifting him up as a near perfect political figure, despite the fact that he was not as far right as many of the candidates are and, in fact, acted in ways that were contradictory to current conservative doctrine.

What I don't understand is why this isn't brought up more often? Why are candidates not at least asked about why they love Reagan so much, why they believe he made the country so great, and why their personal views differ from those they extol?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3m45jh/why_dont_conservatives_get_quizzed_about_reagan/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443041902,1444724860
