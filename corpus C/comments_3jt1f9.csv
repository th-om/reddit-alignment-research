Talks about how he didn't want to work hard labor like his dad, and talks about little life strategies like letting someone show you their ideas despite you having little to no actual interest in it. The section ""Trump Cards"" are funny mottos behind his thinking, reminded me of The 48 Laws of Power. Even if you despise the man, it's a good book illustrating how to be more economical with your time and energy (book starts out with a timeline of his Monday-Friday).",9,0,1441519298,1444732276

I've seen a lot of people online say he's only doing it to make more money. Which is idiotic. There's no way he's making money outta this. He doesn't have a new book out, he's not promoting anything, the guy isn't even accepting campaign contributions! From *anyone*! He's funding this entire thing himself. Out of his own pocket. And it's not cheap. 

I think he really wants to win, and I think he really thinks he can win. And he might be right.

cutbzcg,0,t1_cus4pjk,Frostiken,"No he didn't. He didn't 'lose' any of the non-white vote.

There's only two major non-white ethnic groups in America - black and hispanic.

Blacks vote for Democrats by *over 90% margins*. Democrats could burn the south side of Chicago to the ground and still win the black vote. Trump never had them to begin with. Republicans will never get the black vote no matter what they do, and Democrats will never lose the black vote no matter what they do. That whole demographic is fucked politically, so they don't matter.

As for the Hispanic vote, again, the majority of those populations vote Democrat anyway, or they live in states where the electoral college system renders their opinions moot.

Trump didn't 'lose' anything because he wouldn't have had a significant number of those votes anyway. ",0,0,1441621771,1444732280
cusfqhf,0,t1_cus4pjk,nogodsorkings1,"Thanks to the electoral college system, the non-white vote basically doesn't matter in the presidential election, as it is too diffuse to overcome the more conservative white vote in which it is located. All of the swing states in the past few elections, with the exception of Florida, have non-white percentages in the single digits.

For a presidential candidate, losing 50% of blacks to gain 5% of whites, while a loss in absolute numbers, is a net win on the margin in the electoral college.",1,0,1441546089,1444732280
cusbtdi,0,t1_cus4pjk,TheInternetHivemind,"According to [census.gov](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html) ~78% of the US is white.

Historically, roughly 60% of white people vote republican (according to the [roper center](http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/polls/)). 

That's 46.8% of the vote there. So solving for X (.228 * x = .033) he only needs 14% of the non white vote to win the popular vote. 

So, he really can lose quite a bit of the non-white vote. 

But we don't really use the popular vote, so it's kinda moot. You gotta play the demographics of the swing states, and Florida kills Trump (while two of the other republican candidates do well there). 

But considering that this is the first election since the 60s that the voting rights act isn't in full effect, it might not matter as much as it has recently.

cusixgw,1,t3_3jt1f9,corduroy_Joy,"It's not exactly what you're asking, but I think it's important to note: Becoming president could very well be the most lucrative achievement of Trump's life. That's because members of the executive are able to apply for what's called a [certificate of investiture](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1043) IRC ยง1043), which enables them to sell those assets that could cause a conflict of interest without paying taxes on them. 

This feature of the tax code was mentioned once during Romney's campaign (see the last section of this [CNN Money article](http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/01/news/economy/romney_fortune/)), but for some reason no one is talking about in regards to Trump, though the tax-savings would be astronomical for him, perhaps billions.
