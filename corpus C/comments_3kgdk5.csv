I think even if a lot of people would agree with you about the debates as currently set up having problems, there also is a decent amount of party loyalty in the system.  Look at Trump having to eventually sign the pledge not to run as a third party as an example - shows that even his supporters were uncomfortable with him bucking party norms and unity.

Also worth considering that most of these people know their chances are low, even if this political move payed out perfectly, and that Hill is probably getting the nom no matter what they do. And pulling a stunt like this would hurt the democrats' collective chances pretty substantially.

Again Trump is a good example, though not a great parallel.  I would argue he is damaging party prospects by disrupting the field.  On top of that, I think it's pretty likely that the dems are hoping to flaunt how comparatively civil their processes are--look at us,  we're the adults in the room.  Thus for neither Sanders nor Clinton has said anything negative directly about the other. I have to imagine that at least clinton would if she thought it was in her favor - she didn't seem bothered going negative against Obama on moral grounds, and I think its more likely that her political calculus has changed than her moral inhibitions.

cuxfw0a,1,t3_3kgdk5,ben_chowd,"I think it's a great idea, seems like a no brainer to me.  The news networks have seen that the debates generate big ratings (at least a lot more than their normal awful programming).  They want more debates as well.  If the DNC has to cancel all their debates due to no candidates, networks will air alternative debates, and Hillary would look bad if she skipped those.   
   
This reminds me of when Florida and Michigan moved up their primary against DNC rules in 2008 and Obama took his name off the ballot. Hillary ""won"" 54% of the vote while ""Uncommited"" won 40%.",1,0,1441935264,1444730408
