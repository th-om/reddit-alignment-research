From the first moment, George Bush said that if Saddam stepped down on his own and the Iraqi people cooperated peacefully, we would not invade... that may be the closest to a factual representation of what you are saying...

But in every single speech he talked about the ""Long road ahead"" helping rebuild Iraq and helping them become a democracy.

Have you ever actually listened to or read his ""Mission Accomplished""  - another meme I'm sure you know...

>Admiral Kelly, Captain Card, officers and sailors of the USS Abraham Lincoln, my fellow Americans: Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the Battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. **And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country.**

See how that opens?

>We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We are bringing order to parts of that country that remain dangerous. We are pursuing and finding leaders of the old regime, who will be held to account for their crimes. We have begun the search for hidden chemical and biological weapons, and already know of hundreds of sites that will be investigated. We are helping to rebuild Iraq, where the dictator built palaces for himself, instead of hospitals and schools. And we will stand with the new leaders of Iraq as they establish a government of, by, and for the Iraqi people. The transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time, but it is worth every effort. Our coalition will stay until our work is done. And then we will leave — and we will leave behind a free Iraq.

Over and over the mantra from the Bush administration was ""We will not give a timeline for withdrawl. We will stand down when the Iraqi's are ready to stand up"".

If you agree with the Iraq War you agree that the U.S. Should successively invade and nation build a cross the globe. 

The only REAL defense for the Iraq War would be that it was essential for US national security. The job of the military is to protect the US and keep it safe, not turn middle eastern dictatorships into Utopias. 

The rhetoric went from ""we need to invade Iraq to keep America safe"" to ""we are doing great things in Iraq and charitably helping the people there"" very quickly. The first is a reason to go to war, the second is not. Doesn't it seem strange that leading up to war, the White House talked so much about weapons of mass destruction and Saddam supporting Islamic terrorists? Bush realized that he needed to make an argument about national security, not ""we just want to free the people!""

I admit that the whole ""we aren't nation building, we are helping Iraq build their own nation"" is empty political rhetoric made to distinguish themselves from Clinton or whoever else. 

Here is a later link that, while not really relevant, is still interesting.

cv976yd,0,t1_cv70b7a,Gnome_Sane,"> The idea of singling out Saddam as the only terrible dictator in the world whose people we should liberate with an army is not guided by sobriety. If you agree with the Iraq War you agree that the U.S. Should successively invade and nation build a cross the globe.

I think every nation should act against tyrants, that is correct. Just like I think that if you and I were on the highway and I sideswiped you in my car and gave you the finger and drove off - you should be able to pick up a phone and call the cops on me. This idea that we have to stand and watch and there is nothing we can do is a meme.

>Please drop your trope about memes.

Awww. It's cute that you want to try to use my rhetoric.

>The only REAL defense for the Iraq War would be that it was essential for US national security. The job of the military is to protect the US and keep it safe, not turn middle eastern dictatorships into Utopias.

Yes. I said they should be Utopias. You are very astute.",0,0,1442856092,1444727101

So you would have us invade most of Africa, Myanmar, Honduras, Thailand, etc.? 

We should *especially* invade our own ally, Saudi Arabia, right? Instead of selling weapons to their dictatorship while they sentence dissidents to death? 

Your ideology is completely removed from realpolitik or anything resembling what the US military is, a force for maintaining American hegemony. You'd have us invade our allies just because they're cruel dictatorships... 

Then your candidate should *definitely* remind current constituents he doesn't agree with Bush, who did of course prop up our allies who know nothing of democracy. Because even George Bush could understand that a dictatorship that likes you is better than a democracy that hates you. 

I mean, you are aware that the USA opposes democratically elected terrorist groups like Hamas, right? And that the USA would rather see Palestine under the command of a dictatorship than let the Palestinians elect our enemies into power... 

The only people who support the Iraq War are people like you, people who think the USA should invade every dictatorship on earth, even those allied with it. You've pretty much proven my point that the Iraq War is indefensible without taking an absurd position. 

>This idea that we have to stand and watch and there is nothing we can do is a meme.

Good thing that's not what I said. What I said is, looking at Saudi Arabia for example, it is in our best interest to stand and watch and not do anything. Because they're not a threat to US hegemony, and neither was Saddam Hussein after the Gulf War. ",1,0,1442856673,1444727101

Your idea that any of those places look like ISIS controlled territories, Syria, Iraq and the Libya we did invade and destroy without rebuilding back in 2011... is farcical. Not every country should be treated the way ISIS should be treated, no.

Your inability to admit that you like the police or see the reason to have stability and order in the world is your issue, not mine.

If it makes you feel better to pretend everyplace on earth looks like ISIS controlled territory and should be treated the same - then enjoy.

I have no idea how ISIS even entered the discussion, they didn't exist in the time period we are talking about.

You have no idea how ISIS entered a discussion on foreign policy and the state of the middle east... this probably explains why you don't understand much about what I am saying.
