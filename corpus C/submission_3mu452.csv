The Millennial generation (ages 18-35, give or take) is largely ignored by the older generations.  The importance of this election cannot be overstated, as it *could* decide an entire generations allegiance.  

Currently, Millennials mostly identify as [Independent](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/), but tend to vote Democrat.  I believe this is because the democrat/social issues are *cooler* and more exciting to support.  In other words, saving the planet and legalization of marijuana is more exciting than lower taxes and deregulation.  

Older Millennials grew up with 8 years of Bush -- and plenty of war to go around.  Younger Millennials only know Obama -- and still hear about constant problems in the middle east.  Millennials agree on one thing: we do not want America to be the world's police.

Millennials also grew up with a terrible economy, high cost of living, inflated student loan debt, and a pitiful job market.  And with all that, Millennials are still optimistic and have an entrepreneurial spirit.  As soon as Millennials experience the unrelenting force that is government regulation, they realize that barriers to entry aren't helping the younger generations at all.  Want to start a [food truck](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233386)?  Better get licensed.  Want to be a [dental hygienist](https://www.adha.org/resources-docs/7512_CE_Requirements_by_State.pdf)?  Better pay the government for your licensing and classes every year or so.  Want to take an [Uber](http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/07/uber-vs-laws-000172) downtown?  Better hurry before the government shuts it down.  

This election is very important because 8 more years of *terrible* could sway an entire generation in one direction.  A bad Democrat president could produce a generation of Republicans, and vice-versa.  The same could be said for a *good* candidate from either party.  What would happen if we have Bush?  What would happen if we have Clinton?  What would happen if we have [candidate]?

Are the older generations ignoring the Millennial generation?  Do you think we are on the verge of major change to our government as Millennials become a bigger part of society?

I was at an Americans for Prosperity event recently, and I did my own unofficial polling of hundreds of people.  The question:  ""Who is your favorite candidate?"".  The baby boomers and gen-x'ers overwhelmingly supported Trump and Cruz.  The Millennials **all** support Rand Paul.  Feel free to draw your own conclusions.
