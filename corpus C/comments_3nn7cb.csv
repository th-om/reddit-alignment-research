cvq22ab,0,t1_cvq18ki,jazzmoses,"> You are sorely mistaken if you think the healthcare industry is a competitive market.

? Not sure what you're getting at. I was arguing against further reducing freedom and increasing inefficient centralised economic planning in the market in question. That doesn't imply that the American healthcare market is totally competitive, although from my understanding it is one of the more free such markets in the world (not that that's much of an achievement). 

Anyway, assuming you are American, a little education for you. It seems a lot of people in your country are angry because you believe that healthcare is unaffordable and only accessible to the rich. You think that somehow that problem is greedy hospitals or something. Well the problem is your government raising costs and making the market less efficient, so that there is an economic ""dead zone"" at the lower end of the market where it becomes extremely difficult for firms to compete in offering low-cost products, resulting in poor supply to that market segment.

Basically, the degree to which healthcare in your country (assuming you are American) is not a competitive market is the degree to which your government damages the free market by both passively and actively inhibiting competition. Passive in that a large and punitive legal apparatus teamed with complex, unnecessary and inefficient coercive legislation increases costs for businesses (both through cost of compliance and risk of prosecution), favouring economies of scale and thus punishing small firms and firms attempting to enter the market. Active in that the state apparatus may be leveraged by firms to win noncompetitive advantages, and here economies of scale again favour larger firms, because they are able to achieve a greater impact with a given proportion of corporate resources through manipulation of government agents.

In both cases the answer to win greater efficiencies is to reduce and remove all government control over the market. Then the healthcare market will be subject to the same forces which promote efficiency and consumer satisfaction in many many other less-restricted markets in society.

These markets seem to be so dysfunctional exactly because the government intervenes so much in them. It's not raining because the street is wet, the streets are wet because it's raining.

Competition is a spectrum that goes from a true monopoly to perfect competition. So when I say the American healthcare industry is noncompetitive, that means that it is comprised largely of local monopolies and oligopolies, with the only exceptions being large urban centers.

Again, this is econ 101, so I'm not sure why I have to hold your hand through this if you've actually received an economics education - it should have been apparent from literally my first comment.

It's completely analogous to utilities, telecom, airlines, and even financial institutions. You have an industry with high barriers to entry (not including the barriers presented by government regulation). This creates a non-competitive market, which necessitates government regulation. This further increases the barriers to entry, but is necessary because there is no competitive pressure to innovate, cut costs, increase efficiency, etc.
