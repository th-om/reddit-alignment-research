3l6db6,[Serious] Which candidate will best support my view on segregationism?,78,okthrowitawayz67843,This is a serious question. I am a segregationist. I am not a racist however. I grew up in a very southern baptist area with a conservative father so I was just born into it. I do not hate minorities.. I just dont think we should intermingle or socialize. I wish we could just give them their plot of land and never have to deal with them. Why cant they keep themselves up from there bootstraps? Anyways... I just want to know which candidate would fit my best interest. This is a big issue to me.,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l6db6/serious_which_candidate_will_best_support_my_view/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442414481,1444727893
