Once again hyperbolic bullshit, if you have actual evidence of bribery bring it forth to the justice department and people will go jail. I have yet to see any evidence that money in politics is an actual problem.

The problem is we don't know the victim's story behind it. He's dead. We only know the officer's. Asking a public official who carries a gun to wear a body camera isn't asking that much.

Not to mention, you don't need to look far to find evidence of racial profiling in police departments for who they decide to pull over.

That's the problem. It's legal bribery. Basically, the political opinions of anyone who can't donate 1+ million are regarded as second-class citizens. Climate Change is a great example.
