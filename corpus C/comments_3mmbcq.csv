cvg94wq,1,t3_3mmbcq,Revere12,"I think Hilary Clinton is running a dreadful campaign. 

She seems so guarded, so packaged, so cautious. She just seems very inauthentic. I say this as someone who is likely to vote for her in the general election. 

Honestly, I think that Jeb is doing a good job. He's not lighting the world on fire but he does come off as the 'adult in the room' in the debates. I'll never vote for him but I believe that he's running a good campaign. 

Fiorina is getting a lot of attention and she's been great at the debates but she's stated a lot of things as 'facts' that aren't actually facts. A narrative is going to form around her and her loose relationship with the truth. She's going to tank pretty quickly. ",8,0,1443391934,1444723175
cvga1me,0,t1_cvg94wq,wbmccl,"I agree with most of these. I think Clinton running in a real race with serious and qualified contenders would be struggling for air. But give her team credit, they did a great job keeping the air of inevitably up for as long as they have. She might just be able to get through the primary because she crowded out the oxygen of anyone that wanted to get name recognition and traction in the last year.

I also agree that Jeb is doing better than he gets credit for. Presidential elections are all about the long game. An insurgent candidate can try to go all in on early states or dominate small groups within the electorate to get poll numbers and name recognition, but it's ultimately all about broad appeal, sustained support and careful, steady execution of a strategy. Bush has been so-so in his debates, but otherwise he's doing all of that well. So too are other candidates, from current contenders like Rubio to bubble candidates like Kasich. All three of those guys could still take it.

Fiorina looked strong in both debates, but she's a weak campaigner. She does well with short, semi-scripted talking pointsâ€”she's got that great sense of corporate PR. But she flounders in more back-and-forth and unpredictable discussions, like at the NH Forum. Same with Carson. All the non-politicians can ride the anti-establishment coattails as long as they want, but a good debater and a more focused media can really expose their inexperience in public policy. It's just a matter of time.

I think someone like O'Malley needs to get into a debate. He might fail just as hard as he is now, but if there's a national Democratic debate with Clinton, Sanders, O'Malley, Webb and Chafee, I think O'Malley's got the most to gain. He's got more than a mountain to climb, but I think discounting him is wrong. Put him in front of a national audience and then we'll see.

But all of that is just about campaigning and election odds, not the actual merits of any candidate.",2,0,1443393535,1444723175

cvg9yid,1,t3_3mmbcq,AMatterofTrust,"Best(G.O.P) - Marco Rubio

I support Jeb Bush over him, but Marco Rubio appeals to all aspects of the republican party, has experience, is a fit for the GOP, and can compromise without giving up all his ideals. He is also very knowledgeable. 

Worst(G.O.P)- Donald Trump, obvious reasons

Best(Democrats)- Jim Webb

He is willing to work with republicans, is a moderate, gives his reasoning for things, and knows what he is talking about. 

See I can judge the opposite parties candidates by how much they give in to the other party to!

You can't simultaneously say John Kasich is good because he will compromise but on the other side Sanders is best because he won't and pretend this question is not actually about who is good for the country but who is willing to cave into what you want. 

Ok for real, who would make the most effective leader on the democrats side?

Hilary Clinton, without a doubt. 

Who is the worst democrats?

Bernie Sanders. Honestly, he does not know what he is talking about when it comes to the economy, he has no major legislative accomplishments. All ""senior member"" means is that he has been there for a long time. He did not actually do anything besides try to pass bills he knew he could not pass to get political points. 

And he wants to audit the fed. Honestly, that probably kills his entire platform. The actual policies at best he wants to implement will take months to implement (probably a lot longer) but being anti-fed is terrible. Monetary policy matters **far more than anything that can reliably pass congress** and as president he has control over the federal reserve. He already tried allying himself with libertarian republicans to destroy its semi-independence.
