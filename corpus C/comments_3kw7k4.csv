cv13t2r,1,t3_3kw7k4,ISBUchild,"While in principle I would prefer the state have nothing to do with defining marriage, in practice it is very difficult for the government to not define some template for what marriage is.

Marriage is one of the most weighty arrangements people can enter into that will affect their legal affairs. If someone dies without a will, presumably they want their spouse to inherit their assets. If someone is unconscious, their spouse will be presumed to have been delegated some medical decision making power. If government employees get health insurance that covers their families, marriages are the clearest record of who that family is. If a couple starts taking on assets and obligations together, a marriage makes a clear statement that they are contracting as a single unit for purposes of liability and control.

Since marriage interacts with so many civil law functions of modern life, it is inevitable that people would want to register this legal relationship with government offices to serve as a definitive record, since the government needs to recognize that marriage several times per year anyway to record titles and so forth. However, this also puts government in the awkward position of having to define that which it is regulating, to prevent abuse in edge cases and keep the regulatory conception of marriage near to the social definition of marriage it is trying to parallel. Sometimes this leads to the state restricting the scope of marriage (a century ago) and sometimes the equal protection expected of treatment by law expands the scope of marriage (today).

Conflict is inevitable when religious/cultural traditions start being formalized by lawyers, because everyone must agree to more or less the same template, and that tends to produce feedback into the traditions changing and being compromised. I don't really know many opponents of gay marriage who actually care about whether the government extends spousal benefits to gay partners, or otherwise permit them to act in civil law more or less in the same way as straight people do. More are now saying that they want to see the state get out defining marriage again, as it threatens their interpretation of the word and institution. I sympathize and agree with the principle, but it's *really hard* to have the government execute civil law functions while not assigning special treatment to a legal-religious arrangement that the majority of citizens engage in.",9,0,1442237547,1444729205

Hey, I agree! As long as the two people involved are legally competent to enter into a contract and aren't involved in any other contracts that would cause this contract to be invalid, the government has no business saying whether or not people should be allowed to enter into a marriage contract.

No, totally false. Marriage was traditionally ordained by the families who chose to marry their offspring together. On a tribal level, that constitutes government.
