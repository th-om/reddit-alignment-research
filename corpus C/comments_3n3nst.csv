It's because since the last time a big drought came through the state there have been no efforts to increase long term water storage nor improve infrastructure. On top of that, our population increased dramatically so we're working with less available water for the demand anyway.

Before the drought got bad, or even close to the point it is now, environmentalist groups kept farmers from receiving access to surface water on account of the whole ""delta smelt"" situation. Farmers needed their water, so they began to utilize their wells. Meanwhile cities like San Francisco and LA kept getting water out of the reservoirs and rapidly expanding through development. Queue a large drought and so the surface runoff that normally went to farms dries up, no longer replenishing the reservoirs either. Cities start draining them quickly because environmentalist groups from big cities only care about what other people do to the environment. As this continues, farmers now get no surface water and are pretty much forced to empty out the aquifers that were never meant to sustain this much use in the first place.

cvktmv9,1,t3_3n3nst,tomanonimos,">What do you personally feel is the best long-term solution to this problem?

First let me say that we can cross out private use and environmental use of the water. Personal usage of water, especially with the better efficiency of the usage, makes their percentage negligible in the sense that no matter how much they cut their water usage it changes nothing. Of course we still need to go at people needlessly wasting water.

Environmental usage of water for the most part is crucial. If we remove water for environmental usage, there will be a devastating domino effect on the environment and on the people. 

The long-term solution to this problem is to make an infrastructure that captures enough water to sustain California for 10 years and find ways to recharge our groundwater. The aquifers in the Central Valley will disappear soon and that is really bad since most farmers get their water from groundwater. The growing consensus is that California will no longer have a snow pack to rely on for continuous water so we need to capture more rain runoff to compensate. I will start thinking of building desalination plants once they get more efficient, in terms of power usage and product. Until then desalination plants are not the solution and are a waste of money.

Don't take this the wrong way, but the issue is that you are wanting to fix the problem your ideas and are not being open to other's ideas.  If the the united states replaced every coal and natural gas power plant with a nuclear power plant, how would that effect CO2 emissions?

Something else to think about: there are 2 million more white tail deer in the united states now than when Columbus landed.  We talk a lot about emissions from cows (methane is a potent greenhouse gas), but you guys always seem to ignore those 2 million additional white tail deer.  

Building literally a hundred new nuclear power plants, and killing off literally millions of white tail deer, however are not politically correct, so we can't consider or talk about these ideas.

If you are sincerely concerned about global climate change (like I am) then you need to start making some hard choices, instead of just sticking with the easy ones.

Again, I meant no offense.  Also, I would love to hear your rebuttal/thoughts.
