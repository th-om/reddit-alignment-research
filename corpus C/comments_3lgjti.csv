We aren't currently engaged in any sort of negotiation or formal direct talks and I don't think she meant withdrawing our diplomatic presence from Russia, which would make no sense from any perspective. 

> Russia would obviously not take kindly and it would lead to the brink of war. 

Brink of war? Saber rattling and increasing military spending are the norm. 

Fiorina's argument seems to rely on the common Republican misconception that the Obama administration hasn't used the military in an aggressive enough fashion, basically assuming that nothing is really being done now so that when they get into office they'll ""do something"".

cv63i3j,1,t3_3lgjti,lollersauce914,"Unless we actually intervened in non-NATO countries (e.g. Belarus or Ukraine) this would not lead to war. Putin certainly wouldn't declare war just because we put troops in the Baltics. I don't think he's feeling particularly suicidal.

What it could do is piss off France and some other EU states and could contribute to a breaking down in unity over EU sanctions on Russia. Then again, tacit non-discussion with Putin has already been the policy, so I'd think it would most likely preserve the status quo.

Also, in the event of a war between Russia and NATO, China would probably (happily) sit that one out.",8,0,1442599021,1444727026

cv6gfj9,1,t3_3lgjti,CUDawg30,"First off this is far from a new idea on handling aggressive nations. Ronald Reagan did this to deal with the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton did a version of this with the People's Republic of China in like 1996. Also its interesting to note that the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics did this very thing to each other throughout the Cold War era. India and China have done this kind of thing to each other through their history as well. Its used to get the attention of the opposing nation to show that enough is enough. Usually it affects the allies of the nation more than the actual nation. Like if the US did this its more likely that China would urge Russia to chill out than the Russian government itself. When China did this to India it caused the United States to step in to hold up India from attaching Pakistan. 

As for NATO and the other US allies reactions well most will just go along with it. NATO will most likely be involved in any military training in the Baltic. Most would urge communications though but few would actively oppose war gaming that every nation does from time to time. 

As for this leading to war its extremely unlikely for a number of reasons. First China wasn't exactly over joyed when Russia invaded Georgia and the Ukraine in the first place due mainly to the concern over Russian expansion into Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan which is the main oil supplier to the People's Republic of China. Secondly China is a nation that doesn't concern itself in conflicts that have no impact on its sphere of influence in Asia. Its very doubtful that the People's Republic of China will go to war for Russian ambitions of reestablishing a new version of the Soviet Union. A nation that the People's Republic of China had a rivalry with over power and influence in Asia during the Cold War. Would they defend Russia if attacked sure would they declare war just because of a military exercise in an area China could care less about is very unlikely. This is especially true if you look at what China would have to face in the Pacific and Asia if they did. They would certainly be facing the combined might of the United States, Taiwan, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, and South Korea. India could come into play here as well. Not that India would absolutely support the US but they would most likely side with the allies just because of the hostilities between China and India and they would have an opportunity to move into areas of dispute with China with the support of most of Europe and the Pacific Allies. China would be looking at a possibility of a three front war just because Russia had a hissy over a war game that the Russians themselves have caused in their aggression along the boarder. If China has no interest in fighting a very disruptive war for Russian ambitions then Russia would stand completely alone against the military might of Europe, North America, and the Pacific allies.

cv6rwt6,1,t3_3lgjti,DevonWeeks,"It's actually a very traditional and effective tactic, and it is puzzling it isn't utilized by Obama more often.  Ask yourself when the last war broke out because a nation carried out exercises and didn't talk to other nations.  The answer?  Never.  It hasn't happened.  I understand why people feel like it would lead to war.  I do.  It's follows quite logically that would be the case.  But, it's one of those counterintuitive things that just doesn't work the way we think it would.  It doesn't cause war and hasn't.  It demonstrates your readiness to respond to aggression and is a very effective deterrent to bad behavior.  If we had five thousand troops in Georgia doing exercises with the Georgian military near the Russian border, do you think Russia would have invaded them?  Think about it.  Would the result have been more or less war?  Russia only took that action because it was unlikely to lose anything of significance.  If we were there doing exercises, invading means dealing with us, not just the Georgians.  That means Russia stands to lose a hell of a lot.  So, the approach Mrs. Fiorina advocates is not proven to lead to war.  It has demonstrably deterred war many times.",1,0,1442652742,1444727026

Think about it, the Iran Deal focuses on Russia, China, EU, and USA lifting sanctions on Iran under the condition Iran allows much more stringent inspections.  

Fiorina does not support the deal.  What happens without the deal?  We have no Additional Protocol on Iran and we have to bank on Russia, China, and the EU keeping up sanctions.  Hm, what's the issue now?  

Well Fiorina is trying to heavily pressure Russia and refuses to speak with them.  Yet she wants sanctions multilaterally put on Iran, including Russia's compliance with keeping sanctions on Iran.  But why would they do that if Fiorina is trying to pressure them so hard?  Putin would never agree to looking that weak.

So now Iran has much less limitation on its nuclear program, their sanctions are eased, and they are getting to do more trade with Russia and China thanks to Fiorina's pressure on the two countries.",0,0,1442631744,1444727030
