3ktqzh,"Are there any legitimate, scientifically accepted theories on the pros and cons of Mass Immigration?",13,thewalkingfred,"This is quickly becoming one of those heated issues with missinformation being thrown left and right. I hear people talk about the collapse of the Roman Empire and proof that their country will be destroyed by immigrants. I've heard people basically say ""Well it worked well for America, it'll work for the EU.""

None of these seem like well researched statements but when I googled mass immigration, the only results were from political news websites spewing the same partisan lines. I guess that explains where people are getting the arguments from but it doesnt help me understand the issue any better.

Are there any widely accepted theories on the effects of Mass Immigration?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ktqzh/are_there_any_legitimate_scientifically_accepted/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442177014,1444729336
