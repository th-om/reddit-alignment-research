cvimy3r,1,t3_3mvm81,Information_Landmine,"I don't understand what the ""genetic diseases"" exclusion from preexisting conditions does. How is a ""genetic disease"" defined? Lots of illnesses are due to a combination of both genetic and environmental factors.

Anyway, I would hate to go back to letting insurance companies have preexisting condition exclusions. I had an ear infection when I was 2 years old, and contracted another when I was 12 (swimmer's ear), and the insurance company tried to deny coverage because I apparently had a 10 year long ear infection. It was just a tactic they use to find any reason to initially deny a claim, and it's abhorrent.

I think it's among the most atrocious pieces of legislation passed in my lifetime and among the most reckless and destructive political maneuvers in American history.  But, even I admit there are some reforms that needed to happen anyway and that don't need to be repealed, pre-existing conditions being one of them.  Also, while some of the 10 essential health benefit requirements are unnecessary and need to go, not all of them do.  It looks too much like you took every single issue as an all or nothing proposition.",1,0,1443596409,1444722092
cvjgylq,1,t3_3mvm81,mrhymer,">Nationalize emergency rooms and place them under the National Emergency Services. 

Emergency room personnel would fly in from D.C. three days after your heart attack. The national guard would have to sweep the hospital and declare it a safe zone before the federal employees could enter the building. Look at history for why your idea is a bad one.

>Disallow states from creating barriers to health insurance companies from other states.

Agreed

>Reword the ACA so that insurance companies are allowed to refuse coverage for pre-existing conditions WITH THE EXCEPTION OF genetic diseases.

Because of fat people and drug addicts I assume. Another idea - make everyone pay for their own care.

>If a patient gets sick, goes to the hospital, and if for any reason their insurance policy changes from the time that they contracted the disease, to the time that they were treated, allow the patient to claim coverage from their old insurance policy to pay for treatment.

How about eliminating third party payers all together?

>Eliminate requirements for states to build healthcare exchanges, and instead let the federal government take control of all existing exchanges along with building new ones in states that have not yet built an exchange.

So you just poked your head from your bunker. This did not go well. Is still not going well.

>Eliminate Medicare, Medicaid, and VA care and replace all of them with a unified, single public payer option that has negotiating power over healthcare contracts, and allow low-income, elderly, and veterans to qualify.

Eliminate government as a third party payer. Make it so doctors deal with all patients directly.

>Eliminate the 10 essential health benefits requirement from Obamacare.

Eliminate all third party requirements for care. Pay doctors and hospitals the money we give third parties in exchange for all of our care.

>Fix Healthcare.gov to eliminate its glitches and add a better layer of cyber security. What do you think? Any suggestions?

You would have to eliminate government to do this.",1,0,1443632667,1444722092
