Hillary being a woman does not change the fact that she was involved in shady incidents in the past that would prevent people from liking her, especially people that already disagree with her politics.

All-together, this is a pretty racist discussion (if every race is going to use the race-card, then you can be damn sure I'm going to use it as well ). If black men did not like Hillary then there would be no discussions on ""does sexism play a role in the unfavorable ratings towards Hillary among black-men?"" 

Lastly; I am aware the statistic concerns men, and I admit to not knowing the female unfavorability rating towards Hillary, however- I can say that many of the women I know (who are generally right-leaning) have extremely negative opinions about Hillary. Would it be sexist then for them to dislike her? Furthermore this distinction serves as a reminder to keep the 'scale' in mind- this statistic measures ""unfavorability,"" it does not say that ""74% of men said that Hillary should go back into the kitchen."" Unfavorable is a completely different rating than ""hatred""

cvenmta,1,t3_3mf9tt,norahceh,"Yes, and I think even more so classism.

Class is often unexamined in American society. It does not mean that people do not react and recognise symbols of it. The Democrats have often used a tone that is considered pandering by the lower classes.

Bubba (as the random working class voter, not bubba as Bill) then gets pissed about being talked down to. He has to deal with that shit at work and at church. No damn way he is voting for it. Even though it is against his best interest financially, it is his only choice emotionally.

For women it is harder to avoid the symbols that people associate with classism. 

A guy in a suit is a guy in a suit. Unless he is some bro flashing around a 20k watch guys in suits are equal. If you want you can even wear jeans with the sport coat and come off as less of an ass to the lower class, while still wearing the trapping that are necessary for the liberal elite to consider you for the position (and the liberal elite fund the campaigns).

There is not the equivalent trappings that a woman can wear to bridge the class issue. In addition women wear their social status, through jewelry. Clinton has a collection of necklaces and jewelry (dozens, look at the various photos of her online) that scream out - I can wear a useless piece of junk to show my class that costs more than you make in a year.

These are just some ideas I've been thinking about. They are not backed up by research (that I know of), and even if correct there are probably huge gaps in how primates behave that are left out. 

I have ordered 4 books in the last week dealing with class in American society, and am looking for more that deal with the interaction of gender and class. I think it is a fascinating question that I look forward to learning more about.",4,0,1443258483,1444723500
