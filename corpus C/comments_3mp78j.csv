To me, this story of reactionary elements on the far right in Germany highlights the need for more international cooperation to take the pressure off of any single country. In the 50's and 60's Hungarian refugees were overwhelming Austria, where there were similar reactionary positions being taken against them. Then, nearly every country agreed through the UN to take some of the refugees who have, since then, proven to add value well in excess of the comparatively meager costs of resettling them.

There are real concerns about Syrian refugees, such as economic migrants posing as refugees and the likelihood that these people may not return to Syria in the long term (over half of residential housing in Syria has been destroyed and there is little chance of domestic stability in the near and medium turn).

If Germans don't like what their leaders have done then Germans should elect politicians who refute the UNHCR and the treaty (that Germany signed) that obligates them to offer asylum to refugees. 

> The political and social landscape of Europe is about to be seriously affected by the sheer numbers of people that are coming.

Population of EU: 503 million (4% or about 20 million are Muslim currently)

Syrian refugees (total): about 4 million with the vast majority in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan.

Even if *every single one* of these people moved to the EU, the statistics would look like this:

Population of the EU: 507 million (5% or about 24 million are Muslim)
