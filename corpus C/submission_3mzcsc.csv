3mzcsc,Opinion: Russia propping up Assad might be a blessing in disguise.,25,pleasure2kill,"Just a thought: Assad is a bad guy, and a terrible leader. However, as with many Middle Eastern countries in the past, dictators have generally kept their populations in line, and prevented the spread of terrorism. 

If the Russians help Assad regain control over Syria, it would help end the civil war and push out ISIS, and probably end the refugee crisis. The US obviously can't openly condone this, but it would be useful in the end for the region. 

I'm not saying that I particularly like Assad, but I think a strong dictator would keep that country safe from becoming a breeding ground for future terrorist groups. A US-funded rebellion would only create a power vacuum like Iraq and more chaos.
