Say what you will about the corporate media in the US ( which deserves criticism ) , but Russia is a different beast altogether. 6 journalists from [Novaya Gazeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novaya_Gazeta) have been murdered in the last decade because of their investigations. It's also ranked the 2nd most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist ( after Mexico ) . When the founder of the Russian facebook refused to remove an opposition page from the website his home was surrounded by a [swat team](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/technology/once-celebrated-in-russia-programmer-pavel-durov-chooses-exile.html), and he has chosen to go into exile saying that Russia is not an environment where freedom of information can thrive. His company his since been divided up to [Putin's friends](http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/31/5363990/how-putins-cronies-seized-control-over-russias-facebook-pavel-durov-vk). They just took it.  So yes, American media sucks, but hey, we can always turn on Russia Today from the comfort of our living room basically anywhere in the US. And some say that's the problem, that anyone with money can make a station. Including Putin.  But in Russia, the media is tightly controlled by the state. They can sway public opinion with no problem. ",21,0,1442345041,1444728134

The state firmly controls the media narrative to drive just that response (scapegoating NATO). Like people of all nations Russians are prone to blaming other people but themselves for their country's problems (that's just kind of a human thing). However, the state plays a very, very obvious, deliberate role in promoting that narrative and quashing all others.",14,0,1442347127,1444728134
cv2xkmc,1,t3_3l2m1l,askinnydude,"Certainly a lot of it is deliberate. Like with any other autocratic regime, stirring up anger against an out-group, particularly a historic foe like the United States, is a convenient method to maintain power.

However, I do think the Russian position is a little more complex than we sometimes make it out to be. [Very interesting interview here with Vladimir Lukin](http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/number/Vladimir-Lukin-I-Am-a-Bit-Wary-of-a-Popular-Foreign-Policy-17363). Basically, from his perspective, the Russians had to deal with massive societal change, and they didn't get a whole lot of help. To be quite honest, the United States and its allies pretty much acted as if Russia was irrelevant, rather than being a regional power and prospective partner.

Now, it is true that the US owed Russia absolutely nothing, but historical cases like the Versailles treaty and the Marshal plan are clear evidence (to me) that the opportunity was there to bring Russia into the fold. Instead, the moves we made on the chessboard made the Russians feel like we kicked them while they were down.

You also had several instances where the United States (under NATO auspices or on its own) either intervened without authorization of the UN Security Council - Kosovo, Iraq - or twisted a UNSC resolution into something it wasn't intended to do, like in Libya. The US is a superpower; Russia is not. It's possible that the Putin regime genuinely fears the US has an ulterior motive to overthrow and/or destroy the Russian state, however ridiculous that may seem to us, and we can't be counted on to play by the rules, so to speak.

(Quick edit - don't agree with the Kremlin on anything really, just thought I'd add what I think might be their perspective).",4,0,1442360235,1444728134
cv30gkz,0,t1_cv2xkmc,Precursor2552,"I think you should move Iraq into the second category with Libya. They twisted the 'Material Breach' clause to mean removing the cease fire rather than getting a follow-on resolution. 

Kosovo they pretty much just shrugged and said 'Eh we won't do it again.' While Tony Blair winked and crossed his fingers. ",1,0,1442365262,1444728134

This is my exact perspective on Russia too.  Our foreign policy after 1992 has been absolutely abysmal when dealing with the world's second most significant power.",2,0,1442364583,1444728134
