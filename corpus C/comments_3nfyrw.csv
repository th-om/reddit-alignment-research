cvnot31,1,t3_3nfyrw,ClockOfTheLongNow,"> Really how much of the Government is under his control, and was it really Obama that went back on his promises or Congress that actually shut his bills down?

For what it's worth, Obama ran on a net spending cut and never even tried.  While he does need Congress to play ball to a point, he had plenty of time to achieve a lot of goals with a couple months of a filibuster-proof majority and opted to use his political capital on a health care bill instead.

So it's not so much that Obama went back on his promises, but more that he's an amazing campaigner and terrible politician/political tactition.  Even now, he wants to start talking about gun control as election season is ramping up?  ",18,0,1443960650,1444719443

I think the difference was that many of Obama's supporters were either young, or maybe just politically naive, and actually had the expectation that he was being serious. The took at face value that anything that Obama promised would actually come to pass, and as a result they may be more disillusioned than the typical voter. 

Perhaps they will learn from that experience come the next election, and be a bit more skeptical. ",4,0,1443961944,1444719451

In a word, no.  The Bush administration negotiated a status of forces agreement, sofa, that like all such agreements, was time limited.  It was expected to be renewed and extended.  The Obama administration chose not to do that, then bragged about ending the war Iraq.  The narrative about the Bush timeline only emerged after Iraq went to hell.",0,0,1444003043,1444719455

cvodtqm,1,t3_3nfyrw,cassander,"He's not very good at the job. This is not my evaluation of his politics, it's a given we don't agree on those.  The guy is objectively just terrible at pushing an agenda.  He had continually alienated everyone in dc, republican or democrat.  His only legislative accomplishment, the ACA, it's so unpopular he's illegally refusing to implement large parts of it.  He had so few friends he couldn't even stop the democrats from humiliating him on trade. Granted, I don't mind this so much, because I don't agree with his goals, but the same can't be said on foreign policy.

  Unfortunately, he's been even worse there.  that's been nothing but a parade of failures from day one.  With the possible exception of India, there's no where he's been where things are better than when he came into office.  Literally hundreds of thousands are dead because of policies he's pursued, to no gain.  He's a catastrophe.",1,0,1444003955,1444719455
cvofmap,1,t3_3nfyrw,lametown_poopypants,"To the extent that he's gone back on promises, there's an element of him not publicly really doing that much about the issues.  Like when he was campaigning it was all ""I'm gonna shut down Gitmo"" and so on.  But in office he's been pretty mum on the topic.  Other items he's been held up by Congress on things like immigration where it seems he wants to act, but needs Congress to do the work.  

I also think he's failed to negotiate across the aisle well since he seems to enjoy publicly bashing Republicans as opposed to trying to work with them, although that could be my bias. ",1,0,1444007253,1444719455
cvol0qk,1,t3_3nfyrw,nekurashinen,"Not sure if anyone legitimately has an unbiased view but... my opinion:

I've liked Obama's presidency. He came in with a nation on the verge of some serious financial problems - a banking industry collapsing and an economy in free-fall.  Both last minute efforts by Bush and Obama's early efforts not only avoided the catastrophe but setup for a rising economy. Since then, politics between his administration and the GOP helped to dramatically slow the economic rise but not kill it. 

I was not a fan of his weakness when it came to the ACA. I think he should have pushed for more and ended up getting a very compromised program that nobody really seems completely thrilled with.    He is doing the same with the TPP.  I do not really see the same with the Iran Nuclear deal, though many people do. 

What I absolutely hate about his administration:  his handling of Snowden and all whistleblowers. Related, his hands off or rather collusion with the NSA. Unlike many other agencies where politics and separation of powers prevent him from doing much, the NSA is DoD and thus well under his Commander in Chief role.   Like the NSA shit, his collusion with Big Banking, appointing many of the same ol-same ol characters that have long been a part of the problem just paint him as ""part of the establishment"" and thus, in my opinion, part of the problem.

Most of the things he said during his campaign were how many people felt about the Bush administration, which is what won him the election. People were tired of pointless wars in the Middle East, irresponsible economic activity, and invasive spying.  
Instead, we got the exact same with Obama as we did with Bush. While I don't think we should have ever gone into Iraq, we never should have left. (Although as another redditor has mentioned, that was Bush's doing.)  
In the end, we had to go back into the Middle East to deal first with Libya, then the Syrian civil war, and now ISIS. 
As for spying, who could forget Obama's staunch support for the PATRIOT act?
