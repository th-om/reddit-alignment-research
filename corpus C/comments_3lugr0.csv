At the time, the ways and means chairman was almost more influential than the speaker of the house, so old Wilbur was a really important man. He also happened to be an alcoholic and was having an affair with a stripper affectionately known as the 'argentine firecracker' (in reality she was from New York). Mills was stopped near the washington monument while driving drunk through the capital with said stripper who tried to escape by fleeing through the tidal basin. While this initial incident was covered up due to Mills being a very powerful man and it being the 1970's, it all came to light a couple weeks later after Mills got on stage with the same stripper at a burlesque show and then held a press conference from her dressing room while completely shithoused. That one was a wee bit harder to cover up. ",34,0,1442866569,1444725690

He was a habitual bribe-taker, which only became a PR problem for him when his state lost its ability to keep him popular with public spending when Louisiana had a budget crisis in the 80s. When he was indicted by a federal a US attorney he rode to the courthouse on a mule, saying it represented the expediency of the federal government. He gambled a lot of money away in Vegas from briefcases of unknown origin. By 1987 he was so dominant in Louisiana that Buddy Roemer beat him in the election by promising to ""slay the dragon"" Edwards had created in office.

His best moments came from his reelection campaign in 1991. During the primaries newspapers said that Edwards could only be elected if he ran against Hitler. He ended up running against prominent neo-Nazi David Duke. During the election he stated he was concerned for Duke's health from being near so many burning crosses, and claimed that ""The only thing we have in common is weâ€™re both wizards under the sheets."" In the late 90s he was sent to prison for his crimes during his last term as governor. ",28,0,1442871546,1444725694
