cv53gfr,1,t3_3lcd5c,WhiteyDude,"I love his idea.
The problem with raising the minimum wage is there's always a little bit of pain with it. Make no mistake, I'm for minimum wage, but when it is raised, it might be the difference that forces employers to let someone go, or not hire more. It balances out eventually, but the pain gets worse the longer you go between raises, because you'll inevitably have bigger jumps in pay. If raising the minimum wage was on a regular schedule, it be somewhat predictable and the negative effects would go away almost entirely.",5,0,1442521897,1444727338

If a person isn't worth promoting, but is suddenly going to cost you more, then you have no reason to keep them over a cheaper, younger person.

I also think it ignores older inexperienced people.  Some people don't start working until they are older, for whatever reason.  These people would be ignored by such a law as they need entry level work, but would be beaten out by younger people who are, again, cheaper.",2,0,1442526793,1444727338

If we made the minimum wage indexed to inflation from the start, the wage would be somewhere around $4.25 or so.  I think that's a good starting point if we want to find some middle ground on the minimum wage, not going ever-higher on the federal level and ignoring local needs.",0,0,1442526549,1444727338

This is one of multiple answers I've gotten over the years regarding ""what does the minimum wage accomplish.""  I don't think there's any consistency in the reasoning, nor is wage policy a good way to keep people out of poverty.

Productivity is extremely high when compared to other places in the world.  But you think the cost of labor should be lower.  I seriously want to know what you base the value of labor on.  Other countries?  Are you one of the people who support lower wages because people will work for less in another country?  It's a different environment and cost of living in every country.  That is the true measure of what a wage should be.  Wages should match cost of living, and in the united states our wages fail to match the cost of living.

Depends on the work, the job, the employer, the employee, and so on.  It's not an objective measure.

> Wages should match cost of living

This is the opposite.  If anything, cost of living should reflect the wages that people make in a given area, and wage policies distort that.
