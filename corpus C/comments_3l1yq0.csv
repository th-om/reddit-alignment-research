I don't hate Hillary, but I my strong dislike for her is neither vague nor easily manipulated.  The crystallizing moment for me was back in '08 when she ""misspoke"" about the time she and Chelsea had to duck sniper fire while running across the tarmac to safety while in Bosnia.  She very simply and obviously made up a story intended to strengthen her image when her lack of foreign policy experience was being questioned.  When trapped by the facts (the television cameras she apparently forgot were there), she chose to not own up and instead blame her false memory (which she repeated twice more over several weeks) on sleep deprivation.  The icing on the cake is that even if the story had been perfectly true, being shot at doesn't really qualify as foreign policy experience.
