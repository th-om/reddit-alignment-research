3llav4,Can anyone say without a doubt that curing or permanently rehabilitating criminals cannot happen in the future?,22,i_have_severe,"Particular in terms of the ""justice"" system.

Can we be for certain this will not happen in the future?  Should the possibility of a ""cure"" happening in the future put into question peoples stances on capital punishment?

And if we can effectively cure someone from being violent or whatever a ""criminal"" may be in the future, would it be moral or ethical to end their life?  Or even in put someone in prison or detention at all if they're effectively ""cured?""",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3llav4/can_anyone_say_without_a_doubt_that_curing_or/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442690434,1444726500
