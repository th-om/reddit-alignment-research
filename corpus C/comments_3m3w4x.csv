cvbt9cf,1,t3_3m3w4x,hitbyacar1,Can you explain the FDA's restrictions on imported drugs and how those affect the market?,8,0,1443042009,1444724868
cvbwqnd,0,t1_cvbt9cf,HealthcareEconomist3,"FDA don't restrict imports, that's CBP. The FDA stipulate that drugs imported must meet US packaging, information and manufacturing standards only. Other statutes also exist restricting the use of imports (EG Medicare restricts their use).

Absent other restrictions a drug imported from another country would meet FDA standards if it was already licensed in the US, used the same production line as the drug already available in the US, was repackaged to meet US standards and included a US drug information sheet.

Obviously it increases the cost of the drugs we buy but the solution is not as clean as simply allowing consumers & wholesalers to import drugs.

TRIPS also established a schedule of how pharma patents apply to countries based on their level of development. Low-income countries are permitted to completely ignore pharma patents, an amendment also allows them to have third part countries manufacture drugs on their behalf. Middle-income countries (such as India) are required to use a licensing system such that the drugs are produced similarly to if they were generics, the pay <1% the cost of high-income countries. High-income countries do not receive special accommodations under TRIPS other then for essential medicines and public health emergencies.

Between high-income countries most pay fairly equitably based on how wealthy they are, drug purchasers generally operate monopsonies but recognize the need not to abuse their market power as it simply shifts cost elsewhere in the world. The UK and Canada (but significantly more so the UK) are the low outliers for per-unit costs, everyone else effectively subsidizes their consumption.

The true ideal is, of course, everyone pays equitably with their wealth but its a very difficult issue to resolve. Allowing people to import drugs will go one of three ways;

1. Countries which currently underpay will bring up their payment rates such that they are equitable with their wealth.
2. Countries which currently underpay don't bring up their payment rates, as US consumers fund about half total worldwide development activity IND's drop spectacularly and we don't get new drugs.
3. Advanced economies write a treaty to finally deal with this issue, magically even though the EU haven't been able to deal with this problem in three decades the US becoming involved results in progress.

3 would be the best result, having an environment where countries can simply force others to pay more by reducing the value they place on efficacy is not a particularly good position to be in. #1 is basically not going to happen.

The danger with the US allowing consumers & wholesalers to import from elsewhere is that #2 happens, having new drug development occur is desirable even if we pay a larger share of those development costs then we should. A similar situation exists with vaccine research, its almost entirely publicly funded and the US is responsible for 87% of the worldwide total.

TL;DR: Its complicated.

 Here's a great example: http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/business/big-price-increase-for-tb-drug-is-rescinded.html?referrer=&_r=0

The article talks about two drugs. One is the one everybody is up in arms about and the other is Cycloserine. Cycloserine covers a disease the sees 90 new cases a year. 90 cases is nothing.  I am more than willing to bet that unless the government created a monopoly for that drug, it would not exist as there is simple no way a company could guarantee it could cover it's costs

I know a lot of people don't like it, but guaranteeing that a company can at least cover the costs that go in to making a drug is important. It takes nearly 2bn to bring a new drug to the market.

cvc4u57,0,t1_cvc3c07,SapCPark,"At least according to the British Journal of Medicine, yes.  The pharmaceutical industry has a lot of ""me too"" drug development.  These drugs are very similar to other drugs in the market but are slightly different, allowing them to be marketed as a new drug.  These drugs are cheap to make since most of the research is already done and the slight modifications aren't expensive to make.  They serve as the profit source for the industry through the downtime of the blockbuster drugs (Lipitor, Prilosec, etc.).  A lot of early research gets done not at the private sector but at the university level.  Once the drug development has started and moved along to an advanced stage (close to clinical trials), professors and universities will sell the patents to pharmaceutical companies b/c they can do mass development and can fund the clinical trials.  In return, the university and professor get a cut of the royalties from any sales that are made.  ",3,0,1443061466,1444724868
cvc4e40,0,t1_cvc3c07,HealthcareEconomist3,"No. ""Marketing"" is not a line item but rather its lumped in with sales, general and administrative expenses which includes everything from their IT staff, legal fees, office leases through to advertising.

The figures also ignore that most of the big pharma's produce far more then just pharma. J&J spend about double on SG&A what they do on R&D but pharma only accounts for 38% of their revenue, we just don't have enough information to know how much genuinely each company is spending on pharma marketing vs R&D.

From the industry level we know that at least on the average they are not because they are required to report their spending to the FDA who release it as an aggregate figure, for 2014 this was $4.53b vs industry R&D spend of $51.2b for US pharma (marketing figure includes all pharma, including foreign firms).

Edit: Worth mentioning that the $4.53b figure is DTC only, there is another ~$28b which includes physician marketing, corporate sponsorships, endowments, free samples etc.

The US and NZ are the only markets they can advertise in so it would be fairly difficult to advertise enough to push these costs beyond R&D in any case.

cvbxl9w,0,t1_cvbus3n,HealthcareEconomist3,"It contains a number of incorrect points;

> In the US our socialized medicine programs basically pay whatever the pharm companies tell them to since it is illegal for the programs to negotiate. It goes without saying they pay a lot. The rest of the world sort of takes advantage of this and they negotiate prices knowing full well the US basically already covered the pharm firms fixed costs and since the marginal cost of most drugs is next to nothing they know any sales made in their country is basically bonus profit for the pharm firm. Other countries of course get things cheaper.

Medicare part B pays the average sales price for drugs +6% to account for variance. Part D is mostly handled by private RX (so rides on their negotiated rates, this accounts for almost the entirety of part D), for the two plans which are run by CMS they pay the average adjusted wholesale price +5%.

Medicaid varies by state but is composed of 23.1% of ASP federal pharma rebate, ingredient cost paid by the state and a dispensing fee paid by the state. Medicaid underpays significantly, Medicare pays about the same as private plans.

> For drugs with relatively small patient populations like Daraprim the cost of entering the market isn't always worth it so there may only be one firm licensed to sell the drug in the US. Normally they aren't run by subhuman filth and happily supply the drug at a reasonable rate since they have little licensing costs (already are licensed) and the marginal cost of production is so low.

The drug has orphan status and thus exclusivity, no one else can enter the market.

> Because it takes so long and is expensive to get licensed to sell a generic the market can't respond quickly when a firm ups the price 40x for no reason.

Addressed this in my post;

> For this drug the process would take around 6 months. Newer generics take up to 15 months.
> Older drugs like this are inexpensive to manufacture and can use existing filings rather then having to complete their own clinical work so there is not a particularly high cost of entry in this case. The cost to file with the FDA in this case would be $38,020, assuming an existing pharma takes it on additional entry costs are only for things like designing packaging, drug information sheets etc.
