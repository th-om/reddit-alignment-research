That's not necessarily going to be good for the rest of the US.

Bernie is also against student vouchers because of the teacher's union, even though that's a transfer to poor people.

Mr. Stewart is the attorney representing the Federal Election Commission. 

The difficulty here is that almost every book, article, and many online videos are produced, distributed or hosted by corporations. Youtube, Facebook, The New York Times, National Geographic, Time Magazine, CNN, MSNBC, FOX News, hell even Wal Mart are all corporations. The interpretation that the official Government lawyer put forth is that the Government has the authority to regulate or prohibit the distribution of speech if it deals with politics. 

 I have never been more disappointed in John Stewart than how he misrepresented Citizens United, where 5 out of 9 members of the Supreme Court ruled that ""[Congress shall make no law...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text)"" actually means that Congress shall make no law. He argued against the very ruling that protected his show from potential governmental censorship. 

""Why should non-citizens have a political voice in our system?""

Do you only regard ideas if they came from America? Should we ignore praise or criticism based on nationalism? 

The only reason to pass campaign finance reform is to shore up incumbents. Take Senator McCain for example, if I wanted to run against him for his Senate seat, I would need substantially more money to get my name out there than he would. He's been in Congress since 1983, and as far as Arizona is concerned I don't exist. So the McCain Fiengold act of 2002 passed because enough people on both sides of the isle wanted to protect themselves from people trying to take their seats.

I disagree.  Money just equals stuff and time which is the root of everything including corruption.  For corruption, you need force which can sometimes come from ownership, but *always* comes from government.  Government is the forceful allocation of resources which is impossible to do in a pure manner.  And Bernie Sanders want to greatly increase the size of government.

So, yes, corporations can influence governments to do horrible things, but what specifically is the thing being done to you or people you know?  I am of the opinion that the world continuously gets better via the free market and the *only thing* that can screw it up is the government under the guise of protecting people and providing ""free"" services.  Government can and should help, but it should only ever be about 20% of the whole picture.  If we want to grow government services, we should do it slowly and preferably on a state level.
