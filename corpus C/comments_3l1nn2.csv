I'm *really* struggling to see how this was relevant to the comparison. 

In 2006: Private companies were issuing student loans. They were truly risk free for the lenders (banks like Nelnet) because they were guaranteed by the US government. If the student defaulted, the bank did not lose money; ED paid the lender the value of the loan and took the defaulted loan directly. Even so, the lenders were charging 8% interest on a risk free loan.  

In 2015, the ED is issuing student loans directly.  They are no longer risk free to the lender (now ED), because if the student defaults, ED loses money directly. They loans aren't discharged in bankruptcy, but that doesn't mean they get paid.  In spite of this, ED has already cut costs to the borrower drastically, *and* they're turning a surplus.

The correlation between money printing and inflation is pretty poor actually. I'm not saying it can't produce inflation. I'm saying that it happens when full productive capacity is reached.

Tom-a-to, to-ma-to. Money is always ""printed"" when spent.

>I don't even know what the last sentence is supposed to mean.

I think this is the confusion. When money is spent, whether or not its inflationary depends on whether there exists the production capacity to make it. If there isn't, there is scarcity in that moment and prices will probably rise. But if there exists the production capacity to create it, then there will likely be no inflation. Think about it. I own a widget factory. If I'm going to sell out of widgets, I make more widgets. If I can't, *then I raise prices.*

>The question is how you are going to pay for those services.

No it isn't. The question is how are we going to provide those services. The government can buy anything for sale in dollars. Can we provision the goods to be sold is the question.

It does.  If you print one extra dollar that effects the value of all other dollars, just by an amount so small it's hard to notice.  

>Tom-a-to, to-ma-to. Money is always ""printed"" when spent.

 Are you familiar with ""debt"" and ""borrowing?""  We spend money without printing it all the time.  

>Think about it. I own a widget factory. If I'm going to sell out of widgets, I make more widgets. If I can't, then I raise prices.

Right.  However, the more widgets you make the less you can charge per widget because they become increasingly available (assuming no price fixing).  That is the same effect as inflation.  

>No it isn't. The question is how are we going to provide those services. The government can buy anything for sale in dollars.

This is incorrect.  Money in itself is only a symbol, a store of value, a 'promise' note.  When those notes become too common they buy less stuff.  The real value of goods does not fluctuate in accordance with the value of currency.  An increase in the number of dollars does not mean increased buying power or anything like that because *it does not effect the actual value of goods and services*.  

**Edit**: Another way to say that is let's say a government prints 100 dollars and can buy 100 dollars worth of stuff.  If that government decides to print another 900 dollars, giving it 1000 dollars total, it can still only buy the *same* amount of stuff as it did when it printed 100 dollars.  The dollars just represent small fractions of the economy.  

Greenspan is saying exactly this.  He says the danger of SS is that the government could just print the money and pay people off but that the 'real assets' wouldn't be returned to trustees.

Raising prices due to demand of money without production capacity to meet it *is inflation.* Also, you don't understand how a business operates. You don't just start raising prices because there is demand if you can increase production to meet that demand. Price points are very carefully chosen. If you don't increase production and simply raise prices instead then your competitor won't and will steal your market share. You can see this for pretty much every industry.

Fine.  It always devalues the existing dollars.  It does not cause textbook inflation if the supply keeps up with the increase in currency.

I was under the impression that the analogy was meant to be representative of a government, which has a monopoly on legal tender (i.e. a monopoly on widgets).

>What he's saying is that the concern regarding retirees isn't whether or not there will be money, since the government can simply write a check to anyone for anything for sale in dollars. 

That's not true though.  The government can print money, but if that involves printing a large amount of money it would drive up the dollar cost of the good proportionally.  Conversely, if the government owes you 'x' dollars, it can pay you 'x' dollars no matter what.  However, the real value of 'x' before and after printing the money will not be identical.  To your point though, the moment the government prints money to pay for something, the dollar price of that thing increases because the currency has been devalued.      

>The question is always the productive capacity to meet the demand provided by those dollars. He's saying exactly what I'm saying and think isn't right somehow.

*Inflation is a general rise in prices and the measure of dollar devaluation.* You cannot have one without the other. If it was simply spending, we wouldn't have a CPI and all the effort that goes into measuring inflation. We'd simply just point to increases/decreases in dollars and be done with it. In fact, there isn't much relationship between increases in dollars and inflation, except for very large increases or nosedives in productive capacity.

>If you could explain this in a little more detail I'd gladly listen.

When the government deficit spends, the create money from thin air by sending a check to a vender. They also sell bonds. People like to act like a bond has made money disappear, but this ignores how bonds actually operate. When you have a bond, its like having a dollar in your savings account instead of your checking account. Its right there, earning interest, waiting until you decide to move it over to checking and spend it. Likewise, having a bond *is having money*, its just interest bearing money. So the notion that selling bonds while deficit spending somehow reduces economic activity relative to the counterfactual of simply printing makes no sense.

>The government can print money, but if that involves printing a large amount of money it would drive up the dollar cost of the good proportionally.

This is a very old and debunked view of inflation going back to David Hume. We've learned a lot since Hume. What we now know is that inflation is caused by dollars (in the case of the US) exceeding the economy's ability to turn those dollars into products. 

>Where does his talk of 'real assets' mesh with your idea that the government can buy anything by printing more money? He seems to be saying the opposite.

The context of that remark is that Ryan has suggested to Greenspan that having a savings account for seniors will make sure that there is enough money available to buy the assets they need. Greenspan disagrees with this notion and says that there is nothing stopping the government from spending whatever money it needs on seniors. So the issue isn't about money. It is about provisioning the *real assets* necessary for seniors. That's not money, that's stuff.

The takeaway for you:

* Inflation isn't simply increasing the money supply. 
* Inflation isn't caused by just increasing the money supply.
* Bonds are good as cash in economic effects.
* Having enough money isn't a concern, having assets is.",2,0,1442504725,1444728426

You probably should actually read Medpac reports rather then relying on partisan policy organizations to get your information. When an Advantage member consumes healthcare at a facility the facility bills the insurer who forwards the Medicare covered portion to the regional CMS center which refunds it directly to the facility. The facility then may kickback a portion of that to the insurer depending on their contract with the insurer, Medpac have indeed identified the FFS vs SNF differentials as something CMS could look at but only if they have real pricing authority rather then the insane SGR/MACRA process.

The result of their pricing is simply higher drug prices elsewhere in the world (primarily US, Japan & Germany), development costs are recovered worldwide and a country paying less then market value does not represent a good deal but rather a transfer from another country.

If you want to bring down US primary drug prices without correcting the inefficiencies inherent in our approvals system the best way to do so is to make the payment model more equitable between advanced economies rather then a few paying far less then they should at the expense of others.

Generics are actually almost always different compositions, Pfizer may have transferred the IP to their subsidiary (but almost certainly not, it has significant IPT costs) and as generics require efficacy or bioequivalence licensing directly without being able to use original submissions they would have simply derived their own composition using the same active compound.

They spend less on health care.  This does not mean the systems cost less, or that they're spending what the health care actually costs.  The United States covers a lot of the excess from European price controls on medicine, for example.

> If one blood test costs, just for example, $50 what would be the price of 20 million blood tests in a year?

Yes it would, and I have no problem putting private healthcare like that out of business if they don't want to be way more tightly regulated. Most other countries still have private healthcare in some form that you can buy in addition to your government provided care so they wouldn't have to go out of business entirely.

And what happens when every hospital in the country is run like public housing?

The ACA wasn't about the cost it was about accessibility, however the rise in healthcare premiums year to year before the ACA was passed was higher than it is now, meaning the ACA has caused prices to come down. You might be an outlier, of course there are going to be some, I'm talking about overall. My premium went up about 17% but now includes vision and some cheaper options for urgent care center compared to Hospitals.

I agree completely that the VA is a clusterfuck, but that is another story completely. If I had my way the VA would be funded 100% before we sent a single troop anywhere. That doesn't mean it's impossible to run, it just needs to be better. A public option should be a great compromise. If it runs as bad as the VA it's not going to beat out private insurers is it? 

> change your insurance. Fewer choices than before ACA, but far more than you want us to have.

You have **more** choices after the ACA, but they aren't much different. You get a slightly different number, with a different logo and different customer service. At the end of the day you still are dealing with a company that takes money from you, gives some of it to the hospital or doctor, some of it for operating expenses like paying their employees e.t.c, and then takes another part of it and pockets it for their shareholders. You really don't have a lot of choice in the United States for healthcare. Most of the time you take whatever your employee decides it will give you. The ACA at least made it affordable for the millions of Americans who employers didn't provide health insurance to either provide it, or give them the option to find a plan that's best for them. 

> car, clothes, food, computer ends up in the pocket of an investor?...

No, and I used to agree with you but no longer do. Health care doesn't really operate in the free market anyway. If you are for the most part locked to an employer and therefore employment to have it, you can't shop around like you would with a Honda or Toyota for a better deal. Every other item you listed can exist in a free market where we can decide where to buy it and from whom. The ACA somewhat brings that to the table, but many of us won't switch because we'd loose our employer's share of the premium. I've said it several times before but I'm for a public option that can compete with private insurance companies. If the government can't run a competent system, it'll fail and no harm done trying. If it succeeds it'll be cheaper for everyone and the private companies will have to change like the rest of the world where they offer supplemental insurance.

I read the NY times, Huffpo, I listen to NPR and I watch CNN.  

> it just needs to be better.

Every president since FDR has promised to cut waste and corruption, and they have all failed.  You'd know that if you ever ventured beyond news sources with a liberal bias.  

I think it is impossible to remove waste and corruption.  I've worked in federal and state contracting, and they're wasteful, period.  Normal people don't spend every nickel of their remaining money on Dec 31st, but federal bureaucrats do.  They call me and want to sign literally any statement of work, not even knowing what they're buying.  They want to get rid of the money.  I make my annual bonus on this behavior, but I'm also paying for it.  We shouldn't reward this behavior by giving them more money to waste.

> If it runs as bad as the VA it's not going to beat out private insurers is it? 

They can price their premiums way under the market.  Look at how airlines sell tickets based only on price.  You don't consider how shitty the product is, you want to save money.  And once the private sector is gone, its gone forever.  

>You have more choices after the ACA, but they aren't much different

I don't have the one choice I want, which is low cost, high deductible insurance purchased on the open market.

>If you are for the most part locked to an employer and therefore employment to have it, you can't shop around like you would with a Honda or Toyota for a better deal.

My alternative would not be more wasteful government bureaucrats, it would be more freedom.  Decouple insurance from employment.

> I've said it several times before but I'm for a public option that can compete with private insurance companies. 

And as I've stated, my concern is it would run the private insurers out.  Either via underpricing them, or just burying them with regulation.

> And again every other civilized country in the world has something like this but us. 

The largest country with something like this is Germany.  We are nearly four times the size of Germany.  Our government is much more wasteful and bureaucratic than Germany.

In short:

* 12% of private health insurance costs go towards administration. Management, advertising, enrolment, collecting premiums, paying claims, etc... A medicare-for-all system would greatly improve our medical loss ratio.

* Medicare is not allowed to negotiate drug prices. Allowing negotiation would greatly reduce the cost of medicare.

* Fragmenting our current nationalized healthcare system between medicare and medicaid incurs and additional administrative cost, especially with the intricacies of the current medicaid enrolement system. Replacing medicaid and medicare with a single medicare-for-all system will reduce administrative costs.

* ""The health care improvements and transition costs of a single-
payer system ($394 billion, Table 2), including expanding 
coverage to 44 million uninsured Americans and upgrading 
coverage for everyone else, would be funded under HR 676 
by $592 billion in savings on administrative costs and reduced 
pharmaceutical prices. As a result of implementation of HR 
676, health spending in the first year would fall by $198 billion 
to $2,964 billion (Table 6).""",1,0,1442444519,1444728493

But greatly increase the losses from waste and fraud.  Private sector companies don't spend every nickel of their remaining money on the last day of the fiscal year.  Every federal state and local agency does this, because money grows on trees for them.  They have no incentive not to spend it on garbage just to empty their bank account.  

>Allowing negotiation would greatly reduce the cost of medicare.

There's a reason why this is always shot down when it hits the floor of congress.

This would also drive down the profits of drug makers, and cut off the supply new drugs.  If you've got a billion dollars to spend on R&D, you are going to spend it on something that will make a return, and hopefully a big one.  Not something that has a statutory limit on price.

It will also throw the pricing of drugs into the hands of politicians who write these laws.  Every drug company is going to be pouring money into elections, trying to get favors.  The possibilities for corruption are huge, and nobody in congress knows shit about drugs or research, yet they'll get to decide.  Horrible idea.

>Replacing medicaid and medicare with a single medicare-for-all system will reduce administrative costs.

There's no reason to think this is true.  The government cannot even build a VA hospital on time and without billion dollar overruns.

>The health care improvements and transition costs of a single- payer system

I don't buy it.  This is the same congress that saddled us with the TSA, and now we're permanently stuck with it.  We cannot reform it, and we cannot end it. 

The TSA cost $1.3 billion its first year, which was twice what the private sector spent.  Since then, the cost has ballooned to $8 billion a year, with no end in sight.  And we all hate the TSA, and we cannot even make modest reforms.

No, I'm trusting of an analysis by an economist, which I've read and don't see flaws in. I've provided an argument that pulls in actual data to make a point, and you've responded with vague truisms. I can and will respond to them to the best of my ability, but until you provide an actual counter-analysis, or point to where you  think the numbers don't add up and what you think they should add up to, this discussion can't really go anywhere.

> But greatly increase the losses from waste and fraud.

What makes you say this? The analysis I provided simply compares the current administrative costs of medicare to private insurance. In order for medicare to have more overhead, it would have to have administrative costs that are 759% the administrative cost of current medicare, per client. Why would expanding medicare make it more wasteful, and if it did make it more wasteful, why would it be nearly 8 times as wasteful as it is right now?

> This would also drive down the profits of drug makers, and cut off the supply new drugs. If you've got a billion dollars to spend on R&D, you are going to spend it on something that will make a return, and hopefully a big one. Not something that has a statutory limit on price.

It would drive down pharmaceutical profits. Right now, the United States subsidizes global drug profits by allowing drug companies to charge medicare whatever they want. Medicare has no negotiating power whatsoever and must accept the price provided by drug producers. So if a producer wants to charge 30x what a drug would fetch at market, they can. Allowing medicare to negotiate prices wouldn't remove drug producers' right to also negotiate prices, it would simply prevent drug companies from funnelling tax payer money into their shareholders' pockets.

This wont cut off the supply of new drugs, because medicare would still be required to insure its clients, but it would allow medicare to place bids comparable to private insurers.


Drug companies could decide to cut back on R&D in order to try to make up for the hit to profit... but you can expect any company that tries this to have their CEO swiftly replaced, as thats more or less one of the biggest and most obvious mistakes you can make in corporate finance. Drug companies are already operating as profitably as possible. They invest in R&D because R&D generates capital. That means that cutting R&D would induce an even *larger* hit to profits.

> Every drug company is going to be pouring money into elections, trying to get favors. The possibilities for corruption are huge, and nobody in congress knows shit about drugs or research, yet they'll get to decide. Horrible idea.

Right now medicare drug pricing is 100% corrupt. Drug companies can request any bid they want, and medicare is forced to accept it. You're worried that dismantling a 100% corrupt system might introduce some level of corruption?

> There's no reason to think this is true. The government cannot even build a VA hospital on time and without billion dollar overruns.

There is a reason, and if you glanced at the analysis I provided, that reason would be apparent. (discussed above)

> The government has never made anything more efficient.

The irony is that medicare is *already* more efficient than private health insurance.

> I don't want my doctor's office to be the equivalent to a DMV visit.

Nationalizing health *insurance* has nothing to do with nationalizing healthcare. Not that that would necessarily be a bad thing. There are plenty of countries with nationalized healthcare which have both cheaper and higher quality healthcare than the US.

Medicare's rates are low for the same reason Comcast's rates are high: their customers have literally *no choice*. Medicare decides what they want to pay, and hospitals are required to accept Medicare patients, so they have to take it. Unfortunately, this means that Medicare [does not actually cover the full costs of the care that its patients receive](http://www.aha.org/content/00-10/05fragilehosps.pdf). Note that this is *before* accounting for salaries and administrative overhead; we're talking just about the marginal cost of each patient.

Given the absurd out and out lies, and misinformation promulgated about the F-35 in order to discredit it, that's a good thing.

The are F-16 variants(the Japanese F-2) that cost more than it.  It's apropos that your link says ""costs more than Australia"".  From what we know of the F/A-18E sale to Australia, the per unit F-35 cost is less than Super Hornets.  European competitors like the Rafale and the Typhoon are only very modestly cheaper from a flyaway standpoint, and are more expensive for the capabilities they offer.

Your link is also pretty misleading, it's citing a cost and ignoring that it's capital and operations costs spread out over 50 years(don't laugh, that's how long the F-15 and F-16 will be flying before they are finally decommissioned).  It claims that the US will have ""15 times as many modern fighters as China"".  Because, I guess, 2400 odd F-35s plus 150 odd F-22s is 15 times the total number of 4+ gen fighters in the PLAAF inventory(500 odd Su-27 variants and 300 odd J-10s).

For the most part, yes.  Your rates are set based on how many subscribers your insurance company has in your given area.  The more subscribers, the better your rates.  If you have ever had shitty insurance you know you have few provider options and it's expensive.  

So if insurance company A has 20,000 subscribers in your city, and insurance company B has 1,000, subscribers to company A will see different prices for their healthcare.  

A single payer system basically changes the game so for the providers, there is only one customer.  The single insurance company effectively sets the price, because the provider has no other option if they want to provide service.  ",4,0,1442335167,1444728509

In fact, people actually do -- people will take a taxi, call their friends or drive themselves if they think it will be cheaper than an ambulance.

The only reason that our wait times were better in the past, is because so many people didn't HAVE health insurance at all.  THAT is rationing.  It's just a less humane form of rationing based on income instead of need.

Do the people who can't secure a spot because there are too many people get fucked and have to go to private schools where they get reduced financial aid?

The core of sanders ""free tuition"" program is to cut pell grants, subsidized loans and pump the money to reduce tuition to $0 at public schools.

The cost for just doing that is astronomical. Unfortunately while doing that, he just sentenced at least a million college kids who can't attend public universities strictly because they're full. 

California's for instance, is basically completely full right now. I know lots of smart kids who got waitlisted from the UC system because there were not enough spots for everyone and had to attend either private university or public universities outside of their state, which, newsflash, cost just as much as private universities 99% of the time.

His plan is pants on head retarded just in that way. That's beyond looking at how poorly managed most public and private schools are, and the fact that by opening the floodgates for possibly even more students in certain areas like the midwest or inter-city that couldn't afford public school and where they have room, you have people who are totally unsuitable to get degrees being enrolled in colleges to get sweet, sweet tax dollars for those studenst tuitions, all the while even if those people complete their degrees, devalues the bachelors for the next set.

Many people can't even get more then basic entry level positions with a bachelors, and many higher level positions require a masters or even PH.d. Continually forcing people through the university system devalues the degree.

The focus should be on stratifying and classifying kids into vocational professions and non-university technical schools to avoid degree glut and harming those who have a degree who are actually qualified.

An excellent question and I would like to hear more from Sanders on the specifics of this.  However, I suspect that the number of people who are both qualified and willing to attend any given school is not going to suddenly double or triple; for the most part, this is about spreading the costs for those who qualify but would have gone into debt, and giving those who qualified but just couldn't afford it a chance.

Tell me which is better, paying $8,000/year for private insurance or paying an additional $6,000/year in taxes for a single payer system that replaces private insurance? 

Discussing the cost of single payer without mentioning its benefits is an exercise in futility at best, propaganda at worst. And considering WSJ is Rupert Murdoch owned, it's very likely the latter. The US spends 18% of our GDP on healthcare and we still don't cover everyone. The next most costly healthcare on earth is France who has one of the best systems in the world at the cost of 12% of GDP, and they have a smaller per capita GDP than the US does. Literally every nation that's adopted single payer has seen massive benefits to both cost and patient care. So the fact that a $16.8 trillion dollar economy would spend $1.5 trillion/year on healthcare is actually a *massive* savings. 

If you want to deal in large numbers, get context. Because 1.5 trillion/year is not a lot of money to cover the nation's medical costs. ",1,0,1442373078,1444728573

Not true; the NHS is really rather poor, as well as the systems of Hungary and Ireland.
