There is nothing good about New Jersey politics.

Corruption.

The good: Generations of Democratic governors (Ray, Gardner, Lowry, Locke, Gregoire, Inslee) and the unique demographics of Washington (75% white), have made it a liberal state without the racial tensions of, for instance, California or New York. The best of both worlds. There is a socially libertarian slant and pro-environment slant (license plates for national parks, endangered wildlife, etc.); unlike Oklahoma or Pennsylvania, the private sector can't just rape the land for profit willy-nilly, ag-gag laws don't fly here, factory farms are frowned upon, marijuana is generally accepted on either side of the Cascades. Jay Inslee wants to tackle climate change, and supports LGBTQ rights. The state is a progressive darling and is attracting lots of tech companies. Abortion laws remain progressive, legal, redistricting for Congress and legislature districts is done by an impartial body; and police reforms are being embraced by lawmakers, the governor, and to some extent by the police unions (although the kicking and screaming by the Seattle Police Officers' Guild torpedoed a rollout of body cameras, and the supposedly impartial civilian oversight body, the OPA, isn't actually very impartial)

The bad: All that money coming in from tech companies and yet the state still struggles to fund education, healthcare and public transportation infrastructure. UW tuition has been increasing at a double digit pace for god knows how long. The Puget Sound's rapid transit system is laughable compared to Vancouver's; they chose density and transit in the 70s while we chose cars and freeways; look where that's got us. The state is always screwing over public school teachers but seems to have no issue giving Boeing billions in tax breaks and slashing worker protections for their unionized machinists.  No state income tax means sky-high liquor, property and car tab taxes, and yet bizarrely gas taxes remain relatively low. Too much direct democracy; some of Washington's ballot initiatives have been as disastrous as California's Prop 19 (Like Referendum 51 Roads and Transit from 2007 and Prop 1 from 2014) Inslee's governance can be reactionary and not based on evidence, like when he vetoed the drone bill and cracked down on electronic cigarettes. Jim McDermott is a clown, Dave Reichert is batshit crazy, and Ed Murray (whose mayoral campaign was bankrolled by Comcast no less) threw out Mike McGinn's gigabit broadband plan for the city.",2,0,1442008405,1444729982

The state legislature will be R for a really long time. Race relations remain terrible since the riots of the late 60's. White flight from Detroit + Gerrymandering + general redneckery has created lots of safe R seats. 

The Overton Window has shifted so far to the right that someone like Gov. Rick Snyder, who hasn't done much other than cut business taxes, shift those taxes onto middle and low income individual taxpayers, and sign a right to work bill, is considered a moderate because of his demeanor and the fact that the legislature is so far to the right. 

And there is those two tea party state house reps who just got expelled or resigned for trying to cover up a sex scandal by using their staff to spread other false, sexy rumors.",1,0,1442064586,1444729986

I think the best thing about this state's political landscape is its political diversity. It's as purple as a state could be and that makes things very politically interesting. Downsides to that is the insane amount of political ads that will start popping up in the very near future.

The best part about Kansas politics is that Jeff Longwell is a half-decent mayor for Wichita.
