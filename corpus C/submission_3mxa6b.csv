3mxa6b,The GOP's pattern of exploiting terrorist attacks.,35,Aumah,"Disclaimer: I don't want this to become a piling on or a mud-slinging contest. These are incredibly controversial and emotionally charged issues. Just try to be respectful of one another. This is politics after all – you're supposed be nice outwardly, while privately praying your enemies meet a fiery demise, of course.

More than most I respect the dirty side of politics, partly because I admire the skill of a well-executed dirty play, and partly just because I'm plain attracted to seedier subjects (I'm a boxing fan too). *But* even I find it much less than cool that the GOP keeps exploiting terrorist attacks on Americans in order to advance unrelated political agendas, e.g., using 9/11 to invade Iraq, using Benghazi to get at Hillary. The Iraq War, I hope most would agree, was truly unforgivable – way across any line. However I do have a measure of respect for the exploitation of Benghazi. Ghoulishness notwithstanding, no one has died from that particular gambit, nor entire regions been destabilized (zing!), and they did finally do some real damage to Hillary with the email mini-scandal. Politics being politics, that's not altogether out of bounds... and hey, they worked for it so I feel they earned it. But that does still leaves the ghoulishness part. Yeah...

So what I'm wondering is: where does this come from? Is it mostly due to the scorched earth nature of modern partisan politics? Is there a greater degree of fanaticism in the GOP? Maybe I'm wrong but I don't see Democrats/liberals crossing lines like these. The only thing I can think of that would be worse would be actually killing Americans intentionally and then exploiting it.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mxa6b/the_gops_pattern_of_exploiting_terrorist_attacks/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443585577,1444721838
