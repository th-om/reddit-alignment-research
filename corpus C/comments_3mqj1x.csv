Do they really agree that it's an ""awful distortionary tax?"" The US corporate taxation system certainly has problems, primarily that it taxes income on all revenue regardless of its country of origin for multinational corporations, but the idea that the corporate tax rate itself is too high seems... overblown.

Not because we should expect to raise significant amounts of money via the corporate tax rate. That's not what it's for. It's an incentive scheme to discourage companies from sitting on giant war chests instead of expanding or paying dividends out to shareholders. That's why pretty much any remotely-justifiable business expense is tax-deductibleâ€”the point has never been about revenue-generation, but about keeping the money flowing.

Dividends are taxed at the corporate tax rate and again at the personal income level.

The corporation has $100. The government is going to take $25.

The corporation wants to spend $15 of that? Go right ahead! Now they have $85 and the government is only going to take $21.25.

Do they want to spend $75 of that? That's fine too! Now they have $25 left and the government is only going to take $6.25

If they want to spend all $100 of it? Fantastic! The government takes $0.

That's how it works. ***Expenses lower the taxation basis.*** You can't point to money taxed as money the corporation couldn't spend because ***the corporation could have always spent it.***

> That is $15 less in spending in the economy. It goes and sits in the government war chest.

Yes, it goes and sits in the government war chest, never to be put back into the economy again. Wait, don't we have a $426 billion dollar federal budget deficit? Silly me, it must be because we're printing $400 billion in cash and setting it on fire just to watch it burn, right, it's not being spent on anything.

The idea is that if you get rid of the tax, that money goes somewhere, and shareholders will press for more dividends (since it isn't taxed twice). Buybacks are proving to be oddly distortionary.  This then sees more people get money paid out, and those people can reinvest it.

But why make that assumption? Part of the problem with the recent recession was that companies making record profits were not spending. 

A high corporate tax creates an incentive for companies to spend, pay wages, reinvest in growth rather than hoard. When you hear ""use it or lose it"" you use it. 

>My least favorite thing about US taxes in general is that you get taxed on stuff you earn overseas. My general philosophy is that you pay taxes where you earn the money.

Let's assume a married couple filling jointly makes $100k.

Under Trump's plan, the first $50k is at 0%, the 2nd 50k is at 10%, so $5000 in taxes before deductions.
