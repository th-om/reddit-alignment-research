I guess you're not a history teacher then.  Look at U.S. politics in the latter half of the 19th century, for example.  Also, look at the rest of the world's Democracies.  The Cold War made us all rally around the flag, but now that it's over we're back to ""normal"".

This may sound harsh, but teachers like you are what is wrong with the United States and you will be our downfall.  If you teach the children of any nation that they are 1) bad (while ignoring the actions and histories of the rest of the world) and 2) are in decline, then they will eventually make it happen.  Tell a child they will succeed enough times and they will.  Tell a child that they are bad and failing and they will become bad failures.

Please stop doing this.  Why not have them write about what good the United States is doing around the world today? (e.g. taking in refugees when other wealthy nations refuse them (e.g. Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Qatar)) ",7,0,1441726895,1444731580

Say what?   [Inflation is low and controlled, and has been for more than 30 years. ](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NQAuKUEl4Y0/T3EjXaTS-2I/AAAAAAAABUQ/k21b2SrBnZQ/s320/U.S.+Yearly+Inflation+Since+1900.jpg)

cuv2e1c,0,t1_cuuknvy,Hes_Spartacus,"Why is inflation good? I won't argue that inflation isn't controlled but I tend to see it more as a negative rather than a positive. Especially for middle class wage laborer's since only in an ideal world would wages track inflation exactly. Inflation is a rate, so like velocity if it is constantly in one direction eventually you are going to end up some place else. Take for example someone earning a fixed wage. If inflation is a constant 3%, every year that wage earner will take home less and less. So even though inflation is low and controlled after 10 years of earning a constant wage they would in reality only have 74.6% of their original buying power.

I cannot see how one can explain the income inequality gap we have today without considering the effect of inflation.",1,0,1441759385,1444731580
cuvir0r,0,t1_cuv2e1c,yankeesyes,"Modest inflation is good as it reflects steady (and increasing) demand for goods and services.  It also means that the demand for money in the form of loans is healthy.  Modest inflation is good for regular people because most of their ""assets"" are debt-based.  For example, they can pay back yesterday's purchases (credit cards, homes, cars) with today's devalued money.

70's and early 80's inflation of 10+% is not healthy, but under 5% generally is considered to be healthy by economists because it indicates healthy demand.",1,0,1441803023,1444731580
cuw7qcs,0,t1_cuvir0r,Hes_Spartacus,"I think what you're saying is exactly why I'm opposed to modest inflation. I agree it creates a supply/demand for things (why not open a factory if I can pay back my investment in inflated dollars or alternatively why not buy stocks if my money will just devalue itself in the bank), but I would argue that that is precisely bad for the middle class. 

Having debt is by definition different than having an asset, but I agree with your statement that regular people often have more debt than assets. However, I don't think it works net in their favor. For example if I were to take out a home loan, and if the bank acts rationally, the interest rate I would pay would be inflation + whatever the bank desires/can afford to profit from. So in the end the person with the loan is ultimately paying for inflation plus the banks profits from that loan. I think this is evident in a lot of the economic data. Who buys more yachts? Why is the wealth gap between the 1 and 99% widening and not shrinking? If what you say is true that having debt in an environment of modest inflation is a benefit why isn't the middle class growing, or the poorest class being raised from poverty?

Also what are the benefits of a deflationary or 0% inflation economy? Instead of a debt fueled demand based economy, it begins to make sense to save money rather than spend it. Saving is the simplest way to advance your economic status (all it requires is not spending as opposed to making wise investments). Also what about people who rent? If you can't afford or don't have the credit to take out a home loan you are forced to pay rent. If the property values keep inflating, even at a modest 5%, it becomes very difficult to keep up. 

Anyway that's my 2 cents. TLDR: I still believe even modest inflation (constant, always in one direction) can explain many of our current economic crises that we face and in general is not always beneficial.",1,0,1441843637,1444731580
