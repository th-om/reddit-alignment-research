3l308m,I see something great in the fact that Trump and Sanders are the current frontrunners...,32,okkoto,"I sat at a breakfast counter a couple of weeks ago and listened to some dude go on about how much he loved Trump. He said, ""The thing I like about him the most is that he doesn't take corporate donations like other politicians."" I thought, well, if that's what you like, you should try Bernie. Same thing, but without all the racism. 

It then dawned on me though that both Trump and Sanders represent some kind of push towards a more populist kind of candidate. I think people finally are understanding that we, the electorate, need to use whatever power we have to squash the nepotism, cronyism, and rampant self-serving corruption that has become the fuel our entire system runs on. 

Either way you slice it, the political establishment must be shitting themselves right now. The whole Republican strategy has been to pull back on the anti-immigrant rhetoric in order to maintain the Latino vote. Although I find Trump to be crass, ignorant, and just plain stupid, I think he genuinely believes himself, and I wonder if that comes through most of all. I know of no elected offical more genuine than Sanders, and maybe Americans are just tired of focus-group tested, hand-crafted bullshit. 

I think it would be fantastic to see a Trump/Sanders debate. If we believe in the power of reason and the deep innate common sense that lies in the heart of human beings, Sanders might be able to sway a lot of Trump voters",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l308m/i_see_something_great_in_the_fact_that_trump_and/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442347487,1444728126
