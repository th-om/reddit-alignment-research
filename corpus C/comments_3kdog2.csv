I think that cops ignoring the law is a real problem. I think that when you strap on a gun and take the authority of society you have a large burden and  restriction on your actions. A cop in that world has options other than refusing to enforce.

And how would that refusal work? If no one objected, fine. If someone objects they are going to get another cop to enforce.

There's a difference between ""being a citizen"" and ""being an employee"".  (And for ""employee"", I include elected officials.)

""Being a citizen"" can include civil disobedience as a means of expression and effecting change in our society.  It can be Very Effective, as the Civil Rights movement showed.  (Not that the Civil Rights movement got **everything** accomplished that they wanted to, but it sure got a **lot** accomplished.)  As a citizen, you are one of ""We the People"", and the system (specifically the government) is **supposed** to be something you can influence.  And you influence it by voting, volunteering at election time, talking with candidates, being a candidate yourself, signing petitions, and so on ... and, for a big enough and ""righteous"" (for lack of a better word) issue, civil disobedience.

""Being an employee"", though, is different.  Here, you are agreeing to perform a certain function on behalf of a certain entity for a certain amount of compensation.  And being an elected official is the same thing, in this regard; when you run for office, you are saying ""I want to perform the function of this office on behalf of the government (which is also on behalf of the constituents).""

If you apply for and get a job, but then say ""Hey, I don't want to do this part of my job description,"" well, then, you risk being fired.  If you're lucky, you'll be able to amend your job description, or move to a different position, but you can't count on that.

If you run for office and then win, but then say ""Hey, I can't do this part of my office's functions,"" then you should damn well quit.

I get that when Kim Davis ran for county clerk, she probably didn't anticipate having to issue licences for same-sex marriages.  But she **did** swear an oath to uphold the Constitution.  The Constitution says (essentially, when you add some early relevant case law) that the Supreme Court is the bunch who decides what is and isn't constitutional.  For Kim Davis to truly uphold the Constitution, she should shrug her shoulders and just bloody well issue marriage licences for same-sex couples.  And if she can't handle that ""amendment"" to her ""job description"", then she should resign and let someone else who **will** to that job take over for her.",6,0,1441904931,1444730734

They're treating all groups equally, so any discrimination charge has minimal chance of success (because being a douche is not a basis for a discrimination conviction). 

I'm also really not sure what recourse the court has to force elected officials to do a job. I'm also not sure if a county has a legal duty to actually issue marriage licenses, so this might be completely legal depending on the jurisdiction (barring court orders like we saw with Davis).

Ah well, at least there's no legal requirement for people to get a marriage license from their county of residence, so this isn't gonna stop any gay people that actually want to get married from getting married.

There would have to be private marriage license issuers (that received public money and would only give licenses to straight people).

>Virginia law, as here applied, unquestionably treats the school children of Prince Edward differently from the way it treats the school children of all other Virginia counties. Prince Edward children must go to a private school or none at all; all other Virginia children can go to public schools. **Closing Prince Edward's schools bears more heavily on Negro children in Prince Edward County since white children there have accredited private schools which they can attend, while colored children until very recently have had no available private schools**, and even the school they now attend is a temporary expedient. **Apart from this expedient, the result is that Prince Edward County school children, if they go to school in their own county, must go to racially segregated schools which, although designated as private, are beneficiaries of county and state support.**

You see, this is the problem with the conversation.  The language automatically presumes that the reasoning behind the decision not to issue the license is because the couple applying is gay.  It's not.  Framing it that way is inherently unfair to the objector.  They are refusing to be a part of something they believe to be sinful, an improper use of what is and has been for many centuries considered a religious sacrament.  When you phrase it the way you did, it's no different then the clerk saying, ""Should you be allowed to ram your gayness down my throat?""  That automatically assigns a degree of bigotry to the gay couple and dismisses their genuine motivation to be a married couple.  When you say, ""Could you refuse to serve someone **because they are gay?**"" you do the exact same thing.  You automatically assign a degree of intolerance and bigotry to the clerk when in fact they just want to be what they believe to be a proper (insert whatever religion the clerk is, I'm not sure).  

We have to stop framing the conversation in those terms because it only causes more division and prevents us from finding equitable solutions.  The question is this.

You are phrasing it in such a way to where anything but complete conformity to your expectations results in someone being a bigot, and it's just not a good stance to take.  

>Do you extend this belief to those who want to refuse service to Muslims as well? ( The gun shop owner for instance)

Well, the gun store is a private company and not the government.  But, yes, I extend that to him, too.  Now, in his case I actually think he's being a bigot (at least the example I saw last year).  His reasonings were based wholly on the practice of racially profiling, and he applied that profile to people it shouldn't apply to strictly because they were Muslim.  For example, he made no distinction between Muslims from near the border of India whose practices are historically peaceful given the influence of Buddhism on them.  He simply lumped every Muslim in with al-Queda, and I think that's bigotry.  He's discriminating based on religion alone, admittedly so.  But, I still believe in the freedom of association, and I say that as a racial minority.  

In the case of the clerk, though, I don't see this as bigotry.  I'm not the same religion as her, but I believe I understand the basics of her doctrine assuming she's any mainstream Protestant religion.  She feels a genuine mandate to uphold a number of sacraments, and marriage is one of them.  Assuming she follows the Bible, she no doubt knows the versus about not lying with a man as one lies with a woman.  People are focusing very narrowly on that concept, but her religion also teaches to love thy neighbor, right?  I argue the people condemning her as a bigot are too emotional immature to understand that you can disagree with someone's lifestyle without hating them or being intolerant of them.

Everyone is dancing around the issue, and Davis certainly most likely had some legal council who advised her to deny everyone licenses because she didn't want to give gay people licenses. But the reality is that at some point, someone, in these offices will have to start giving out licenses to gay couples. If there are people like Davis who refuse to be a part of gay marriages, then that means somebody else will have to be. This sets up a situation where we ( the public ) are paying for an official to only serve a certain part of society. And obviously, that's never going to fly. 

> The simple answer is yes, and the way we do it is to swear in more deputy clerks from other departments and empower them to issue the licenses. 

That's not simple though is it? It creates a situation even more legally questionable than now. As there would be officials designated for gay couples, and other officials who would refuse to serve them. After all, if someone walks into the office in Davis' county and asks for a license, and she sees that it's two men, then she will have to say ( perhaps in the nicest way possible ) to go talk to somebody else. Perhaps somebody else in a different building since the vast majority of clerks in her office are on her side and also say they won't issue the licenses. 

>a practice that is already commonplace on the criminal justice side of the courts and is clearly permissible even outside the criminal court system 

But is it commonplace to swear somebody else in because a public official does not wat t work with somebody based upon their sexual orientation? I really don't understand what you're missing here. Yes, you think the language is divisive, but I'm simply pointing out the reality that there will be real people, asking other real people for a piece of paper.

I wish 'we' in america could have actual discussions on a national scale using facts instead of hate messaging (on both sides) and actual compromises.

Funny thing, Once I was arguing with someone on gun rights (I am a big gun advocate as I collect, shoot and like to take apart to understand how they work. Oh and the being able to defend yourself part is nice as well), they said ""why does the right not compromise on firearms"" to wich I turned the same thing around on them. Their response was ""We are compromising, by letting you still have some guns"" to wich I replied that is not a compromise as they are not giving anything back to us. The left is the side who is actually unwilling to compromise yet they have engrained in their followers a rhetoric that it is the right who is unwilling while they call for no gun laws to be repealed, not even the ones that are pointless such as having suppressors and SBRs in the NFA while trying to take even more every time.

Nope, we need real discourse, with facts and non strawman arguments. Sadly that is not what sells news, acting like 3 year olds does... and that is also how someone gets elected... and now I think in the next 2 to 3 elections, people are figuring out how to promise free stuff for votes (Cough burne sandars cough) more so than in the past and thus our current governmental system as it is, is doomed and will need a change to correct this problem.

Yes, we are.  We're talking about civil disobedience, ignoring the law or one's legal obligations to make a political statement.  The air traffic controllers were contractually bound to not go on strike.  They agreed to the terms.  Congress had actually passed a law that if the air traffic controllers did go on strike they could serve a year in jail!  That law was upheld in 1971 by the Supreme Court.  They ignored their legal obligations and refused to provide their service to the public.  The left supported them.

This is **exactly the same thing that is happening now**, only now it is one person whose refusal to perform their duties isn't risking anyone's life and doesn't have a law establishing a one year incarceration for dereliction of duty.  I argue that you are are the ignoring the comparison here.  The outrage in the case of this clerk is highly selective and opportunistic because a comparable situation involving much wider impact on the public was outwardly praised by the American left and the Democratic Party.  

This is an apples to apples to comparison.  Both involve government employees with a sworn duty to perform for the public, and both are required to perform that duty and not discriminate.  The only distinction between them is one is hired while the other is elected.  That's all.  But, what you do you think the response would have been if Reagan had arrested all of the transportation workers and they had all been jailed for a year?  You can't see my point?   

You're acting like I'm supposed to accept her being elected as being the key factor that derails my argument.  Yet, you've got people supporting your side of this making comparisons to law enforcement... **my profession**.  Last I checked, I'm not elected.  Yet, the comparison is adequate as long as it's them using it against me?  Let's try and shoot for at least a little consistency here.  The relevant factors are whether or not someone has a sworn duty to perform and whether or not failure to perform that duty carries with it a penalty of jail time.  In comparing the clerk to the air traffic controllers, all of those factors are there in both sides.  Yet, one was widely supported by the left while the other is universally condemned.  Now, I could try and extrapolate the motivations behind that, but I'll refrain because there's nothing I could derive from it that wouldn't essentially impugn the character of the American left on a wide scale.

No it wasn't.  I said that white people feel uneasy/uncertain right now.

It's just not that hard to comprehend and I'm not sure why you just can't seem to grasp it.  

My second point was about the cause of the unease itself, which is obviously multifaceted.  One cause is fewer economic opportunities.  We can't buy a house at 22 on a single income anymore. I suppose you could crudely call it ""due to us no longer making all the money"" if you like - but that doesn't invalidate these people's feelings.

>But somehow Kim Davis not wanting to grant marriage licenses ties into all of this?

Yes, let's try this again and see if you can catch the point this time.  Huckabee and other evangelicals are capitalizing on white feelings of ""loss"" by taking a stand.  By saying, we refuse to have our religious views infringed on.  These theatrics lessen feelings of helplessness and loss by providing an organizing principle to rally around.

>I could already tell you were white, most other races aren't as big of dicks to white people like whites tend to be.

The general feeling of uneasiness and uncertainty among white people, I believe exists. I think both the extent to which it exists and the extent to which that can be attributed to the fact that they are white and not other factors is being overestimated.  Huckabee certainly is capitalizing on this in general, although I don't think the Kim Davis situation is an example of this. I think it's far more simple, that there's a sizable group of people who support her views and he's the candidate who sympathizes with them.  Yes, this group is largely white but I don't think their concerns in this particular situation have anything to do with the general unease white people may be feeling.

I will give you that they certainly may be feeling loss, but very specifically due to their beliefs on marriage, and unrelated to their whiteness. I still don't see why whiteness needs to be brought into the discussion. It just feels like you are trying to make a point about the negative attitudes white people share instead of negative attitudes the anti-gay crowd shares.

I think we agree that it exists.  And I think that it's undeniable that the rally held in Davis' honor, which was led by Huckabee (which to me shows that he *is* deeply involved with this particular issue), was undeniably white.  It's not immutably tied to ""whiteness"" but the correlation is strong.

> Yes, this group is largely white but I don't think their concerns in this particular situation have anything to do with the general unease white people may be feeling.

I think it's related because I think that is the brand that conservatives are pushing at the moment.  Are you a disaffected white person?  Blame it on the gays and atheists and Mexicans! That is at least a *part* of the brand these days. 

>I will give you that they certainly may be feeling loss, but very specifically due to their beliefs on marriage, and unrelated to their whiteness. 

See, white people need to get beyond seeing themselves as the default and begin to understand themselves as one of many cultures.  You don't see a bunch of Han Chinese getting upset over gay marriage, and that's not a coincidence.  White people's particular brand of Christianity is what is at issue here.  Sure, it's not exclusively white or not, but that's the crux of things.

>It feels like you are just a little too eager to apply your opinions about white feelings of loss to other situations.

Again, I see it as part of a larger narrative being sold by the right.  Are white people the only group feeling disaffected or dissatisfied?  No.  But other groups can pin their feelings on ""patriarchy"" ""heteronormativity"" ""white supremacy"" etc.  White people are feeling the same negative cultural zeitgeist as the rest of us, and conservatives are the only ones providing a rationale and narrative to contextualize those feelings.  Huckabee and Davis and the evangelicals are a part of it.  Trump and the anti-illegal immigration crowd are a part of it. Romney and his 47% of the country are leeches are a part of it.

The courts don't have that authority. And she is the elected official and told  her employees to not issue the licenses.

There's two lines near the bottom, one for his signature and another one for a court clerk.  Here's the thing, the signature isn't actually from a court clerk.  It's from a dispatcher.

The courts are also capable of empowering another city employee, a preexisting one, not a new one, to perform the duty of issuing marriage certificates.

No, it is right. She is denying gays access. She says so. How she does that does not matter as much. If she locked the door to the building to deny gays access it would not matter that she was also denying everyone access.

Seems fairly apt to me.

In the end, Mrs. Davis insisting on her signature not being a part of the license of her office is an arbitrary line in the sand. She is still profiting off these people's marriage's by receiving a paycheck from doing her job; leading an office that issues those licenses. If it truly bothered her conscience she would leave her position entirely. She wants to keep her job and not be a held morally culpable for her job at the same time. It's sophistry, in my opinion.

So is she really committing an act of civil disobedience or is she trying to have her cake and eat it too?
