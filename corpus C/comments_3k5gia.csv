cuuzqgi,1,t3_3k5gia,CompactedConscience,"There are lots of reasons why we punish people with prison. None of them justify this plan. Are people who commit crimes under the influence likely to weigh the specific sentence they might receive before committing a crime? Are they likely to consider the risks of getting caught at all? If anything, they are probably less likely to do these things than the typical criminal and so this is unlikely to have any deterrential effects. 

Are criminals who commit crimes under the influence better candidates for incapacitation because they are likely to be repeat offenders of victimful crimes? This is the best argument you can make, but we would need to see some evidence that it is true. 

Do people who commit crimes under the influence deserve harsher punishments under any retributive theory? I don't see how drugs make anyone more culpable. 

Would people who commit crimes under the influence benefit from an extended stay in prisonwith the idea that it would help rehabilitate them? The prison system has a pretty abysmal track record of getting people off drugs, so this is dubious. 

I think sentences should be dramatically reduced across the board, but I'm having an especially hard time seeing why they should be increased for drug offenders. In my opinion, the best solution is to make certain drugs that are demonstrably harmless such as marijuana legal. The punishment for more harmful drugs should basically be mandatory empirically grounded medical treatment under the supervision of a judge. ",5,0,1441754764,1444731466

cuv1gp5,0,t1_cuv19v1,TheNaBr,"I disagree with hate crime laws too.  I do agree that they would be in the same vein.  An assault is an assault, it shouldn't matter that it was an inter-racial assault or a if one of the people assaulted was gay.  ",5,0,1441757794,1444731466

cuveudn,1,t3_3k5gia,DevonWeeks,"You're talking about making drugs legal but keeping them as an augmentation.  The problem with that is that you'll have to provide a justification for why they should remain an augmentation, and if they aren't illegal you'll be hard pressed to find a justification that will hold up.  

Obviously, with something DUI the presence of the drug will be a factor, but that's the presence of the drug in your system, not on your person (although I suppose it may be possible to have some kind of similar statute to ""open container"" laws involving drugs, though I don't know what that would look like or how you would enforce it).  But, in commission of other crimes, an augmentation is charged because it, too, is illegal and can have a bearing on the motives of the defendant potentially indicating more malicious intent than is readily apparent.  But, if the drug is legal, what unique malice can be attributed to the possession of it in commission of another crime?",1,0,1441788887,1444731466
cuvjtum,1,t3_3k5gia,worksaf,"Do you realize putting people in jail costs money?  Under what justification should society spend the extra money to jail drug users longer?  Is there a study showing that this would be a successful deterrent for crime?  Any proof at all?

Furthermore, what specific drugs fall under this category and what kind of possession are we talking about?  What is the societal need to punish certain drug users and not others? 

Would this also apply to white collar criminals?

Drug policy and criminal justice reform are complex issues and using ""simple"" solutions will just cause more problems.",1,0,1441805414,1444731466
