3ldkuy,Is Trump's deportation idea really not possible.,102,cipahs,"In the 1950's before the Internet, before PC's, before tech and information integration into government offices 750 immigration officers rounded up and deported over one million illegal immigrants within one year. Many others fled the country fearing arrest. 

Source operation wetback. Google it yourself.

So now in the Information Age, with many times more agents and border security wouldn't it be quite easy to deport a few million within a year?


So how is this idea simply not possible?

(Also it's not racists to want deport illegal immigrants or xenophobic)

Edit 

Btw I'm for modifying the hb1 visa and other skilled work visas, by granting more but also streamlining their immigration process. More or less give them a general visas and then the fact they're skilled worker streamlines the process, so if they lose their job they aren't screwed. This way companies won't treat them as badly since they can take time to get a new job.

Is it racist to not want low skilled immigration? I'm for high skilled workers regardless of skin color.
