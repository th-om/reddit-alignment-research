cuyhclw,0,t1_cuy8nbh,UncleMeat,I actually thought his handling of 9/11 over the next few days was one of the only bright spots of his presidency. Dude went on TV and said in clear terms that we weren't at war with Islam. That was **important**.,2,0,1442014175,1444730030

It's not that hard to get up and leave.

btw, it's minor, and we're only talking about a few minutes.  I have a lot of criticisms for Bush II, and this one doesn't even make the top 10.  But I thought it was strange at the time and OP seemed to be talking specifically about this situation. ",3,0,1442001825,1444730030

cuy9b4q,1,t3_3kkb0r,TheInternetHivemind,"I thought it was a trailer for some movie. The news ticker at the bottom didn't really register. I was 11, 6th grade in my language arts class. Rest of the day is kind of a blur.

If I was president, I'd probably have handled that day doing exactly what Bush did. The days after, probably quite differently, but I think he handled that day about as good as we can expect a human to.

The major way I would have differed would be my handling of the twin towers. I probably wouldn't have had the authority to do this, but I'd probably have leveraged the presidential war powers that allow for action for 90 days. I'd probably get censured for it, but I think it would have been a good way to handle it. But in this little fantasy I have where I had dictatorial powers for just a little while, I'd have mobilized the entire army corps of engineers and rebuilt the towers the exact same way except one story taller as fast as physically possible. 

As to your last point. We can never be safe, that's part of living in a free society. Some asshole's going to get a hold of fertilizer and diesel fuel or whatever and do something stupid. It's still a tragedy, but the alternative is much worse. ",1,0,1442000256,1444730030
cuyb9ka,1,t3_3kkb0r,lametown_poopypants,"1.  I was in school and an hour behind and I wasn't in a class that allowed us to watch it happen until after the second plane hit, but before the towers fell. 

2.  Doesn't seem like much. 

3.  I don't think I would have done much differently in the immediate since I think he handled that okay.  In the longer term, I don't know.  I don't know all that he did and Congress did vote to send troops, so it isn't like he acted unilaterally.  Maybe his info was bad or Cheney was a puppeteer and got the war he wanted.  As an outsider I feel confident saying there's a metric fuck-ton we don't know.

4. Much more safe than on 9/11. People like to preach 'Liberty' and throw out Ben Franklins quote like it means something. However, it's time to realize that terrorists don't play by the same rules. ISIS is using chemical weapons despite it being banned internationally for warfare. Do we really think they're going to say ""Well, looks like America is respecting civil liberties.

cuyhk85,1,t3_3kkb0r,ISBUchild,">2 - What have we learned in the last 14 years, if anything?

Outside threats drive citizen submission, related to the so called ""rally around the flag effect"". Somewhere between the 1996 and 2006 survey years, in direct proportion to their conservatism, [the American public got way more comfortable with obeying the law relative to their own conscience](http://i.imgur.com/us8sG7l.png), and I'm pretty sure that was 9/11's doing.. There's also the [hilariously disconnected-from-reality Bush approval rating](http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/cvfspjk4hesmzts2bc0brg.gif) in the aftermath of the attacks and after declaring war, which was the largest such boost ever recorded.

I was in 4th grade at the time, so didn't really have any emotion for an event that was mostly peripheral to me.",1,0,1442014588,1444730030
cuymfyg,1,t3_3kkb0r,DeHominisDignitate,"1 - I was in my 8th Grade reading class - either second or third period - during which I was reading The Face on the Milk Carton.  Our teachers had told us to put down our books, and, after a brief break, they had set up one of the TV's on movable carts in the library along with some other classes.  They had put on the news, and, honestly, I do not remember whether it was live or recap when the second tower hit.  Given the time frame, I can only imagine that we were watching playbacks.  I grew up in a suburb on the outskirts of Nassau County, and a large majority of the students' parents - usually at least one - worked in the city.  Concern was exacerbated due to congested networks, it was incredibly hard to know what was going on and get in contact.  Overall, a deeply troubling and terrifying time with constant reminders in the form of news and the billowing cloud of brown and black smoke.

2 - I think it is hard to ascribe anything that us as a collective conscience learned from that one moment.  I think it is possible - for better or worse - we learned - or were reminded - that we were not untouchable and that the vast expanses of the Pacific and Atlantic would not keep us safe.  Maybe I was too young to remember or care about partisanship, but, in my memory, it did seem to be unifying across political ideologies, racial barriers, social strata, etc.  Unfortunately, this lesson has not stuck.

3 - I honestly do not know, and, to be truthful, I would be incredulous if anyone claimed they do.  Maybe with hindsight it would be different.  In the immediate moments, I am sure that he was collecting his thoughts as he read to them.  It is also entirely possible the secret service had to make sure it was secure before he could move.  While I am far from having any basis of knowledge in how the secret service or even typical security operate, I cannot fathom that they would not ensure the area was safe.  Yes - it was a school, but it was certainly public knowledge he would be there and would seem like a possibility that the coordinated attack had people on the ground waiting for the president to move in the chaos.

I think overall he handled the immediacy of the attack incredibly well and was an immensely effective leader and figurehead.  I am not speaking in regards to the subsequent Iraq War.  I think it is important to remember that 9/11 was the single greatest threat to both our nation's sovereignty and way of life since Pearl Harbor.  In my memory, he was an immensely tactful and compassionate leader during those times.

4 - I think we are fairly safe, and I think the vast majority of attacks will be prevented before they ever coalesce.  That being said, all it takes is one to get through.  I think the risk of terrorism from domestic sources if of far greater concern - either from converts to the ISIL theology or from extremists at home.",1,0,1442024701,1444730030
cuyvijp,1,t3_3kkb0r,carter1984,"I guess I can answer my own questions...

1 - I had just left my house to go to work when ""breaking news"" come on that a small plane had hit the WTC. I vividly remember the debate over how big the plane was was among those reporting, with the local newscasters speculating on how an accident like that could happen. I felt immediately that this was a terrorist attack and not an accident, even though no one was reporting it as such. I hadn't even made it off out of my neighborhood, so I immediately turned around and when home. I walked in the door, and my elderly father (who live with me and my brother) was already watching CNN. Within a minute the second plane hit, which anyone watching live saw happen. It was absolutely incredible. I was angry. I was honestly ready to enlist to go fight islamic terrorists that day (I couldn't however as I had a torn ACL and was a week away from surgery to repair). It was truly mind numbing, and I remember little else about the day after heading to work. We all sat glued to a TV throughout the day and nothing got done.

2 - Hard to say, but I think the folks who protect us from such attacks learned a lot. As for the average american, I think we learned that we are truly not safe from the scourge of radical Islam in our own country. Prior to that, I truly believe there was a pervasive ""it could never happen here"" attitude regarding terrorism perpetrated by radicals from the middle east, despite their attempt to bomb the WTC in the early 90's. That changed on 9/11 for sure. I think it also brought to light the rule ""war"" that had been going on for so many years prior between radical Islam and the US, but since we never had to deal with it here it never seemed like a war at all, more like a loosely connected series of random attacks at places far from home.

3 - I honestly don't know what I might have done differently in the immediate aftermath of the attacks. I actually though Bush handled that about as best as anyone in that situation could...bringing a calm, reassuring, and sympathetic tone to the country most immediately, and then following up with a military commitment against the radicals, which we had failed to do in any serious manner for the 20 previous years.

4 - I think we are lucky. There have been numerous attempts since then, most all thwarted. My biggest concern is the new ""lone wolf"" terrorist who isn't part of a larger coordinated effort, but instead takes it upon himself to inflict death and destruction where ever they can. The Boston Bombing, the random shootings are examples of the new wave of terrorism that I find more disturbing and frighting since they will so much harder to guard against than any coordinated, well organized, attack.",1,0,1442054929,1444730034
cuy70ba,1,t3_3kkb0r,Fuckdabullshit,"1. I was 12 years old and inside one of the water parks at Disneyworld. My dad had a conference there and the whole family tagged along. I didn't quite understand the magnitude of what was happening and was mostly pissed off that my parents were watching the exact same thing on the TV in the hotel over and over and over again. At the time, we didn't have cable at my house so staying at a hotel was the only time I got my precious ESPN.
