http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34312879

What has caused that to happen? Did government run anti-poverty programs do that? How does a poor society even have such a program? What makes a society 'poor'?

In the US, we've had a ""War on Poverty"" for over 50 years. How do the trends look in the last 50 years compared to the 100 years before the programs? Has the effectiveness of the programs gone up as dollars spent have gone up?

And lastly, how much are you willing to sacrifice future progress to help lives today? Before you call that a heartless question, recognize [that we are constantly doing this, everyday](http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/analysis/the-wealth-health-connection-costly-regulations-take-lives/).

None of this answers your question. But you can't even hope to have a rational conversation until these points are addressed.",8,0,1443476941,1444722789

He and his brother would walk along the railroad tracks and pick up coal that fell out of the passing trains.  That was how they heated their house.  A far cry from what most Americans consider poor.My wife's father grew up in a house with no central heat.  He would heat up rocks in the fireplace and put them in his bed to keep warm.  He has burn scars on his legs from the rocks.  He earned money for school clothes by killing porcupines for the $2 bounty.  He would frequently let them rot before turning them in, hoping the county officials wouldn't want to pick through a bag of decomposing porcupines and would instead just believe him when he lied about how many there were.My point is there's a million miles of difference between relative poverty and abject poverty.",11,0,1443487683,1444722793

cvhc7og,1,t3_3mpxbf,Chemspiration,"So, I was an food stamp recipient (aka EBT) when I was a graduate student. I worked approximately 60 hours per week on average doing full time research, no classes. My stipend for my work was $1181 per month after taxes. This amounts to about $5 per hour. In 2012-2014 dollars. I received $80 per month for buying food only. It literally kept me from starving. I ate bean and cheese burritos for two fucking years. Seriously. I did not do drugs, still dont and I was not allowed an EBT cash option. 

I personally think of all the programs, food stamps is essential if we are to believe that we care about the *very basic needs* of people in situations like mine. There are many people who work full time (an EBT requirement is that the applicant works full time) and still dont make enough to feed themselves much less their family. It is degrading enough to listen to some of the dickhead comments people would make when I was buying 10 cans of beans, a bag of cheese and pack of tortillas, maybe even a gallon of milk. To take that away from me during that time would have ensured serious malnutrition. I ate once a day. 

One thing that pissed me off though was watching a family use the EBT cash they were allowed to buy really crappy food for their kids and use the cash for a carton of cigs and some beer. *That needs to go.*

As for the other programs, I dont have much room to talk as I dont have first hand experience with them. I dont think they are a problem though. I think they need streamlining, like all of our bureaucratic institutions and programs if we want to save money, but the benefits still need to be offered for those in need. Much of the cost of those programs can be attributed to needing four clerical workers and a bureacrat to sign a single form. It is literally the work of a single person spread to five employees.

Why should my university be allowed to pay me a stipend that amounts to less than minimum wage *even at 40 hrs a week?* and that doesnt take into account that I didnt get any medical insurance or medicaid. I am glad that option is there because the 60k in loans I have from undergrad/masters doesnt need to go up. I was essentially being screwed in every way possible for doing what? Wanting to better my situation? I would argue that students like me are probably one of the best investments possible. My research helped start a small company that now pays 15 employees very well. Talk about a return on investment. Its called corporate welfare and the system is set up for it. Many companies *and* state institutions do this. This is because the minimum wage is too low, or too easily circumvented by paying meager ""salaries."" What you should be asking is why you are subsidizing profits for private companies. 

>I bet now you make five times as much money as me.

I currently am in a PhD program that pays fair wages. I make 26k a year and get very basic insurance. I am no longer eligible for benefits and I dont really ever wish to be in a situation that requires that again. I dont regret using that system either. But I think that what you are arguing, and correct me if I am wrong, is that I chose to do this to better myself in the long run. What is wrong with that exactly and why do you think it is bad to invest in people who will eventually offset what they used by paying in much more later on? As for income when I am done, the median salary will put me in place to pay about 40k a year in taxes currently. And I do not mind that at all. Hell, if I make the median Ill pay 50k. The country helped me, and I want to help the country in return. I already have and will continue to do so if my research pays off. 

>And you know, good for you and all, but why did I subsidize that?

Because people voted for politicians who wanted to do that, which is, imho, probably one of the best investments possible. We should be paying for college for our kids.

The economic benefits for the individual and society as a whole are readily apparent by observing the lives of those that have college educations and those that dont. Tell me how many major employers are headed up by someone with a high school diploma. Tell me how many scientific and medical breakthroughs were made by someone without a college degree. Tell me, do you use a hospital? Do you think their ability to keep you alive until you are 90 is because of someone with a high school diploma? How about those airplanes and cars? Did someone with a high school diploma design everything about that car from how it was made and the materials in it to the engine performace and engineering? 

College educations are still the best investment any one person can make and any society that chooses to invest in educating people has benefited by far. You know what holds much of the third world back? No education. There is a reason people risk life and limb to move somewhere where they can be educated. 

And the reason I wouldnt waste time telling someone else all this is because **you are the investor** and we need people like you to see the long term and short term benefits of college educated citizens. People with college degrees commit less crime, they also pay more in taxes. They start businesses and create jobs. They innovate. They do things that have far reaching impact on everything about society. How do you not understand this?

>I think it's bad to force people to do so. And if it really were such a great investment, you wouldn't have to force people to.

Yeah, well if Kim Kardashian is a hotter topic than public education those of us who actually understand the basic underlying foundation of modern first world society kind of have to. 

You said earlier that I probably make 5x what you do. I am going to take that to mean that there is no way in hell you can afford to send your kids to a private school and pay tuition. Now what if I told you that after that, statistically, that hs diploma you payed way too much for is worthless and if your kids are to statistically make something of themselves they now have to also pay, but 15x as much. Now you sit down and do the math and you realize that college is still worth it for them and for society at large because statistically education is strongly correlated with peace and prosperity. You also look at the other option and realize that, statistically, your kid will end up poor and unable to prosper because they didnt go to college. 

If it wasnt a really good investment, the issue of how to take on rising tuition and the trillion dollars in student debt gripping the country wouldnt be an issue because nobody would even think about wasting time and money on college. But they do... and statistically those people, even with all that debt, will still end up prospering. The only question left to ask, imo, is whether you want their prosperity to be hindered by debt or whether you want to pay an extra 0%-5% of your income (sliding scale based on tax bracket) to not have to worry about paying for any of it *and* getting the college education to boot.

There is a jump from entitlements to full autonomy....but that is not because entitlements are too high. They are where they should be. A minimum of what you need to survive.

Universal Basic Income.  Period.  For a bunch of reasons:

* Making it universal means you eliminate any bureaucracies that have grown to decide who's ""eligible"" for benefits and who's ""not eligible"".  Universal would mean ""You're a citizen?  Right, here you go.""

* So many different programs mean so many different bureaucracies.  It's pretty common for a group of 3-4 social welfare programs in the same state to have different requirements.  The more programs you replace with a UBI, the more you save in reduced bureaucracy.

* The mish-mash of different programs leads to perverse disincentives. The classic example is from [this 2012 chart from Pennsylvania;](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2012/11-2/welfare%20cliff.jpg) our hypothetical single mom working for $29,000/yr. would end up **worse** off if she got a promotion or a better job or a raise ... unless her new salary was **$70,000/yr.**  That's insane.  With UBI, if she gets a raise or a promotion or a better job, she keeps almost all of the salary increase (minus whatever her marginal income tax rate is).

* I don't think you can replace Medicare and Medicaid with a UBI.  Better to just switch to a single-payer system like in Canada or many European countries, but that's a subject for another thread or two or ten.

* Programs like Food Stamps are too ""nanny-ish"" and treat recipients like retarded children.  ""No, you can't buy this breakfast cereal, you can only buy *these* breakfast cereals.""  Meanwhile, there's a lot of research out there that whenever there's a choice between giving poor people something like food stamps (money that can only be spent in a limited way) vs. just giving them cash, it ends up being more efficient overall **and** better for the recipients if you just give them cash.

cvhncrs,0,t1_cvhn674,TracyMorganFreeman,"Actually, no we don't. You see, that food was made at a certain margin. Giving too much away will mean the food would be produced at a loss, which would threaten the solvency of that very means of production, which would mean less food in the long run.

It's easy to start the story in the middle without regard to how you got there, but ignoring mechanisms is premature and dangerous.",2,0,1443493151,1444722833
cvho6uo,0,t1_cvhncrs,Zetesofos,"You're not wrong, but you're kind of missing the point that in terms of raw assets and physics - that margin has shrunk significantly and is approaching ZERO. 

That's why UBI is feasible now - the margin of production is closing in on ZERO. ",1,0,1443494490,1444722833
cvhoncz,0,t1_cvho6uo,TracyMorganFreeman,"UBI isn't feasible as long as people can simply vote for an increasing UBI and destabilize it.

You can't vote to spawn more resources or food.",1,0,1443495225,1444722833
cvhovw9,0,t1_cvhoncz,Zetesofos,"Well, then there's your solution. You say ""As long as it stays within X parameter, this program is feasible"".
