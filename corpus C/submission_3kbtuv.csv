3kbtuv,Bernie's true tax rates,90,MustacheBattle,"Bernie says he wants to emulate the social democracies of northern Europe.  That's a legitimate position to hold and he should make the honest arguments in favor of it.  He's being dishonest when he implies that a social democracy with generous benefits can be financed exclusively by slightly higher taxes on the very wealthy.  Scandinavian countries spend around 50% of GDP through government means to finance their welfare systems (the US spends about 35% today at all levels of government).

If we take the [income breakdown in the US today](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/10/30/nyregion/where-the-one-percent-fit-in-the-hierarchy-of-income.html?_r=0) and try to get to 50% of GDP [(59% of income since GDP includes income and depreciation of capital)](http://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipa_primer.pdf) and if we completely saturate the wealthy as much as possible at [70% effective rates](http://econwpa.repec.org/eps/mac/papers/0501/0501023.pdf) we get the following:

* Top 10% earn 50% of income * .70 rate = 35% of all income
* Bottom 90% earn 50% of income * X rate = 24% of all income

X would equal about a 50% effective rate on the bottom 90% which is exactly what happens in a lot of European countries when VATs and other taxes are taken into account.  He's not making that clear when he advocates for his different programs.  He needs to come out and say, ""the average person will be better off giving the government 50% of their earnings than they are today,"" then explain why.",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kbtuv/bernies_true_tax_rates/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441846962,1444730914
