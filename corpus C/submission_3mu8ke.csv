edit: 

Can I ask a serious question: why is this post being downvoted so heavily?  I'd like to have a discussion with Libertarians to explore their beliefs a little further (today, about education policy), but this post is being censored heavily via downvotes.  

What is going on on this sub?  It seems like it has been going downhill over the past few months.  

The censorship of unpopular ideas and unpopular opinions is very dangerous.

What am I doing wrong here, people?

Mods: can the downvote button be removed, like in other subs? (e.g. /r/changemyview)",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mu8ke/question_for_libertarians_do_you_believe_that/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443538332,1444722304
