On some social issues, sure. Big picture? A plurality of Americans identify as conservative.


>Do you think Democrats moving left would increase deadlock instead?

Moving the two parties further apart won't decrease gridlock, ot will increase it.

Your initial premise is based on bad information.

Obamacare only compares well with the 90s Heritage Foundation plan if you use a one-sentence summary.

Cap and trade is opposed because it won't actually do anything. It will maintain current pollution levels, but let companies profit on it.

Republicans oppose Democrat gun proposals because, frankly, they are based in fear-mongering and misinformation (for example, the gun show loophole).

",6,0,1444087967,1444716839
cvpjaj1,0,t1_cvpht8c,Og_The_Barbarian,"Well, a one-sentence summary of the Heritage plan suffices: Much like Obamacare, the 1990's Heritage plan was based on 1) an individual mandate, 2) community rating, 3) standardized benefits, 4) subsidies, and 5) a ban on denying coverage for preexisting conditions. There are definite differences, but the core function of the Heritage plan operates like Obamacare. For better or worse, Republicans won that fight.

You are absolutely right that more Americans identify as conservative than liberal. But on individual issues, even conservatives have shifted to the left. Two of the most stunning examples are same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization:

cvphorh,1,t3_3nmu9v,Grundelwald,"Even if we grant your premises about recent history, I'm not sure how a shift to the left would somehow fix gridlock. If the GOP reacts so viscerally to centrist policies, how would anything get done by the Democrats if they start pushing *actually* socialist policies?

Actually the bigger problem with this thought experiment is that the Democrats would certainly not uniformly shift left, which means you'd have a fragmented democratic minority party in congress, and a fragmented GOP/tea party majority. Best case scenario for the sake of ""ending gridlock"" you would have to expect a coalition between moderates from both parties to unite. Nah.

I actually strongly expect a sort of ""leftist tea party"" to spring up in the wake of Bernie's campaign (much like the Tea Party came from Ron Paul's 08 run), but I think it will simply lead to a more polarized government.",3,0,1444087748,1444716839
cvqbb5a,0,t1_cvphorh,Og_The_Barbarian,"Yeah, I think you've hit on the strongest counter arguments. A far left faction would reduce the current Democratic consensus; and increased room to compromise does not equate to increased WILLINGNESS to compromise.

But I think the effect of more middle ground might outweigh those factors by putting Dems in better negotiating position. For instance: in 2013 Senate Dems proposed universal background checks using existing sellers; Reps blocked it, but Coburn and McCain proposed DIY NICS access. It doesn't look like a compromise, because Dems would be getting what they asked for, universal background checks. Coburn's plan looks liberal. If instead, Dems put up an Australia-style buyback, or even just another assault weapons ban, then Coburn's plan would look conservative, and I bet it would get more conservative support.",1,0,1444153581,1444716843
