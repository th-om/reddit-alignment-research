Sometimes she would just freak the fuck out with a terrible level of anxiety so she would just pick up the phone and she could talk to a doctor in less than a minute.  Plus a professional would come over twice a week or more to check on her and help her cope with whatever was in her head that day.  As if that wasn't enough her mental state made it impossible for her to work so she was put on early retirement, given a meager salary that paid the bills, and she was provided with a one bedroom apt.  She was in her early 20's.

In the USA she would be homeless and on the street.  Her family couldn't deal with her and weren't wealthy enough to get her an apt and pay for everything.  Well her father was but they were distant.  He was no help whatsoever.

So when I refer to mental health care being a problem this is the standard I hold it to.  Even at its most basic level we should be providing free checkups on friends and family who have issues.  Nobody should just be left to their own devices. ",86,0,1443876783,1444719925

Right.  Whether you benefit or not all depends on how much you are making.  Anything over 60,000 US is probably going to be a bust.  If you make under that you'll pay around 31%.  That's a good bit, but if you use a lot of services you still might break even.

You're not understanding this.  You pay in two ways, upfront and through taxes.  If you want to see how much daycare services cost, then you have to include both those costs, not just one.

Whether they are benefiting or not depends on how much they make.  If it's over 62,000 then they are paying 55% in taxes and probably won't be making that up anytime soon.  In fact, we know they aren't.  The reason is that not everyone can come out ahead in a progressive tax system, that's the point.  The poor are afforded benefits and the rich foot the bill.  In Sweden, being rich starts at about 62,000 US dollars.    

>You pay a 1% tax when you buy a home.

I find this pretty much impossible to believe.  And even if you did, the %25 sales tax on virtually everything else lowers your take home pay even more.

2.  Taxes in Sweden are progressive. You don't just end up paying the top tax bracket on your whole income.  The 55% tax rate would only be on any income over around $90,000.  It's 30% up to about $65,000 with a zero percent rate on the first $3000 or so.

Mass shooting is not a normal stress response. A sane, rational person does not see killing many innocent people as the right thing to do. I do not think that mental health reasons are the sole cause, but it's unreasonable to argue that the people committing these crimes are mentally sound.

 When you pair disordered thought patters with other elements such as injustice (perceived or real), discrimination, poor financial resources, relationship problems, or other kinds of stress, it can cause irrational behaviors. For example, if someone has a severe socal anxiety disorder, standing in a line of people at a check out counter can be overwhelming to the point of a panic attack. The disorder itself didn't directly cause the panic attack, standing in a crowded line was the trigger. For most people, this would not be a major issue. If the disorder was treated, standing in line would not be a major issue for this person, but due to the disorder, it became an extremely difficult feat.

You could apply the above example to a mass shooter. Said shooter has an undiagnosed mental condition, then a series of events happen in the shooter's life which he perceives as unfair and not favorable to him. Rage builds and he blames society, then this snowballs into wanting to take action against this perceived injustice society  has burdened him with. While a well adjusted person has healthy coping mechanisms in place, the shooter does not. Think of the movie Taxi Driver, a similar scenario in real life would be plausible, as far as the way Robert DeNiro's character felt.

At the end of the day, there are usually multiple reasons that people commit these crimes. It's important to examine one's mental health in situations where it's likely that said individual is not stable. Also, just because a mental disorder contributed to someone's actions, IT IS IN NO MEANS AN EXCUSE FOR COMMITTING HORRENDOUS ACTS. It is unacceptable to have killing outbursts. Just because soneone is mentally ill does not mean that they can't decipher between right and wrong, nor does it mean they are insane or can plead insanity in court. 

This is an interesting article I found on the subject. It's an interview with a professor from Duke. In a nutshell, he believes that if gun control background checks more thorough screened for mental disorders, it would have an impact on violent crime:

Why is that shortsighted? Mass shootings result from the brew of mental illness, access to guns, and American culture.

And they're not in the top 5 countries with mas shootings. So what makes them different? Culture.

America has a unique gun culture, and the 2nd Amendment, both of which makes it nearly impossible to restrict access to guns. It's incredibly difficult to change an amendment, and even more so to change culture. So of the three factors--mental illness, access to guns, and American culture--which area can we immediately work to improve to make a difference?

2) The per capita rate is still insanely low compared to the US,  we are at nearly 1:1 in America; India would need nearly 33X more guns to approach this level.  

The guns in india also appear to be either exceedingly expensive and the domain of the wealthy, or homegrown pieces of junk.  From [this article](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/20/world/la-fg-india-guns-20120221/2)

> Head-turners include the Russian-made 7.62 Tokarev pistol and its Chinese knockoff selling for as much as $12,000 and the American Colt .45 pistol at $6,000 to $8,000, in addition to Italian-made weapons. Domestic guns are distinctly declasse, seen as low-quality and unreliable, which aficionados say is a legacy of India's protected markets and focus on nonviolence.

The regulations regarding guns are quite a bit different.  From the same article:

>In an attempt to curtail the violence, New Delhi recently started rigidly enforcing its already tough gun licensing rules, which had been easy to bypass through bribes or personal connections. The rules include police checks, strict limits on ammunition and a need to prove that one's life is endangered.

> You seemed to argue that all things being equal (i.e. mental illness affects other populations at the same rate as in the U.S.), gun access is the culprit behind these mass shootings. 

But all things *aren't* equal; guns capable of firing multiple shots cost a thousand dollars, or much, much more.  While there might be a lot of guns from an absolute standpoint, they are not globally available to the all sectors of the Indian population due to cost.  

> So if mental illness affects India and the U.S. the same, and both countries have numerous guns, then it seems this type of violence turns on culture. 

Numerous is an extremely vague term here, they have roughly 30 times *fewer* guns than the US on a per capita basis.  If I make thirty dollars a day, and you are next, at one dollar a day, the fact that everyone else makes ten cents a day doesn't mean you make a lot.

I would wager that even if you had the same number of guns, or more, in these countries, you wouldn't see the same rate of mass shootings. America is culturally different when it comes to guns.

So in the US you have these two overlapping circles, a higher quantity of mentally unstable individuals, and a greater likelihood that those individuals can acquire weapons: Recipe for a quarterly disaster. 

So what do you do about the problem? Restricting gun access might help, but I think the ship has sailed too far for that anymore.

It's funny, but I've thought a lot about the effect that guns, specifically, had on urban youth culture. I lived in a *really* bad neighborhood in the early 70's. There was a lot of violence, but it was physical, close-range violence. It was also before the rise of the current highly-organized gang culture.

I've seen and been in fights between truly mortal enemies. It takes a lot to beat someone to death, and typically those fights were broken up or stopped before any lasting harm was done. Knifings were the big danger, but a knife (surprisingly) requires some skill, and some preparation. It's also possible to escape a guy with a knife. You can run into a store for example, one guy with a knife is not going to attack a store full of people.

I suspect the intimate physical nature of the confrontations also reduced their scope somewhat. Physical prowess isn't evenly distributed, and if Joe-Ogre-Fists is the local terror in your neighborhood, there's incentive for the less-physically gifted to pursue non-violent solutions.
