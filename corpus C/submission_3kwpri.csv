3kwpri,What party will replace the GOP?,22,memefucker420,"I've heard a lot about how the GOP will die out within the next few decades if they don't change their policies to accommodate the changing demographics. If the GOP is replaced, what will it be replaced by? A more centralist party that holds a lot of the same economic views but without the extremist views on minorities, especially Latino immigrants, who will have significant voting power? Or will we see the rise of independent parties and less domination by 2 parities, similar to Canada?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kwpri/what_party_will_replace_the_gop/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442237874,1444729022
