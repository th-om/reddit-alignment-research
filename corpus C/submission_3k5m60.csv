3k5m60,Why does it seem so many republicans are in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy when they themselves would benefit from the opposite?,67,JeepGuy316,"Looking to have a healthy discussion and or reasoning as to why it seems so many republicans favor a tax cut for the wealthy when they themselves could be better off with tax reform for the middle class. Most of this GOP is middle class America so I am curious as to why they are so stuck on giving tax cuts to the wealthy. I understand ""trickle down economics"" but that obviously doesn't work so why back it up so much. If a millionaire saves $30-50K it really doesn't have a big impact on his/her life, if a middle class American saves $3-5K then its a big deal and that money goes back directly into the economy because middle class Americans are almost forced to spend it. Wages aren't going up yet executive pay is going through the roof and yet the common GOP worker seems like they are ok with this. Anyone care to share some insight, ideas, etc?
