cvmpbpv,1,t3_3nanvj,HeyZeusCreaseToast,"I find it interesting how similar the 2016 GOP Primary is to the 2008 Democratic Primary. You have an establishment dynasty candidate (Jeb/Hillary), a statewide elected candidate who represents a state that traditionally votes for the other party and has some negative baggage (Walker/Edwards), a young, racial minority, first term Senator (Rubio/Obama), followed by a mixed bag of candidates. As people consistently point out, Hillary was the favored candidate during the 2008 Democratic Primary, but she didn't really bring a lot of excitement and energy to her campaign and was eventually unseated by the dynamic candidate of Senator Obama.

I think you could also compare the problems and challenges of what a Obama/Clinton ticket would have encountered to what a Rubio/Bush ticket would also encounter. Clinton would have had issues accepting the Veep spot just as Bush would, mainly because of ego, but also because traditionally the Vice-President is a boring job. You also encounter problems if you were to reverse the ticket, and have Bush at the top and Rubio as the Veep, because Rubio has more of the excitement and energy and can sometimes ""topple"" the ticket - you really want the Presidential candidate to have the moment and energy. I do think Rubio would need a Veep that has more experience and age (and implied wisdom) and someone who is white and most likely a male - again, similarly to why Obama picked Biden - and Bush would be an ideal choice, but to spread out the influence on swing states, I could see him choosing Kasich in an attempt to lock down Ohio. I think Bush will most likely look towards a minority candidate, but I think he will look for a woman, and a conservative to lock down the Tea Party voters - New Mexico Governor Susanna Martinez or South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley both fit that description.",2,0,1443878693,1444720046

This is a discussion about how she **as a candidate** compares to Sarah Palin, who was notorious for gaffes and poor public appearances. If anything, Fiorina's problems (namely, her tenure at HP) are on paper. She may very well be the best, most experience public speaker running on either side.
