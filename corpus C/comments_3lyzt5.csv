cvaijeq,1,t3_3lyzt5,WhiteyDude,">  If the US takes in lots of new low-wage immigrants working potentially dangerous jobs, is this a major contributor to expensive health care costs for everyone?

What ""low-wage potentially dangerous"" jobs are you talking about?  Picking fruit, washing dishes and cleaning hotel rooms isn't very dangerous. 

 Also, do the jobs need to get done or not?  Because I don't see why it'd have a different effect if it weren't being done by non-immigrant workers. 

> If most immigrants are people from more socially restrictive cultures, doesn’t that make it harder to drive social progress for women and lgbt people?

Potentially, but not really that much of a consideration.  I don't think we should be deciding immigration policy based on the potential political allegiance of the immigrants. 

> If everyone’s culture is kept distinct as a faster immigration process allows, won’t people feel less connected to other groups, making it harder to share public spaces and harder to make agreements on public policies?

Sharing public places is exactly how people of other cultures become connected to other groups.   ",8,0,1442949770,1444725238

What about my second point?  Because it's not like immigrants are the only ones employed in construction or moving jobs. I don't see how it's any different in regards to healthcare, whether or not the worker is an immigrant.

I read your question, and like I said, the potential political attitudes immigrants have isn't a consideration.

That's your problem, the people you hang around are racists.

Is your premise here that access to low-wage immigrants makes the number of ""dangerous"" low-paying jobs go up? Or that access to low-wage immigrants increases the likelihood of danger in potentially-dangerous jobs that would otherwise result in mitigation measures if they paid better?

> 2) If most immigrants are people from more socially restrictive cultures, doesn’t that make it harder to drive social progress for women and lgbt people?

The people emigrating from more socially-restrictive cultures tend to be coming to escape those social restrictions, and the people emigrating for economic reasons tend to be coming from less socially-restrictive cultures.

The problems happen when you have a sudden massive influx like what's going on in Europe, or when host countries don't prioritize assimilation at a cultural level like, um, Europe. 

>1) If the US takes in lots of new low-wage immigrants working potentially dangerous jobs, is this a major contributor to expensive health care costs for everyone?

The number of jobs is the factor here, not who is doing them. Native-born Americans doing dangerous jobs has the same effect.

cvastx3,0,t1_cvasgqk,thatnameagain,">Wouldn't you say multiculturalism is part of a liberal ideal?

Depends what you mean by multiculturalism. I think most American liberals who say or make the implication that they favor multiculturalism actually mean they favor a 'melting pot' scenario, but they don't want to sound like they're a 5th grader so they don't say ""melting pot"". 

Liberals are not imagining that different cultural groups keep to themselves, have their own neighborhoods, marry only within their own ethnic group, and what not. They're imaging that people are intermingling, living amongst each other, intermingling and intermarrying, and that the cultural values that minority groups have are incorporated and absorbed into the existing mainstream. That is not what multiculturalism actually means, but I believe that's what a lot of liberals think it means. 

>Native born Americans already have the benefits in question. I'm talking about adding a massive amount of new workers and giving them the same benefits.

If ""adding"" means paying taxes then it's not a drain on the system. 

>You're talking about the past, I'm talking about in a presumably ideal progressive US with open borders.

If progressives are advocating open borders, I haven't seen it. Progressives are sympathetic to people who have crossed the border and, facts on the ground being what they are, are already there. Are conservatives more concerned with border security? Yes. But I don't think it's accurate to say that progressives in general advocate open borders. 

To support your point, I think that we are going to see progressives clarifying themselves on this issue in the years ahead, as I've described above, and distancing themselves from extreme-left ideals of open borders. 

Yes I agree with you on 3. 

I don't understand why in all the recent conversation about immigration there hasn't been much talk or discussion about assimilation. People seem to be making blanket assumptions that immigrants simply can't assimilate, and there's no point in encouraging it.

I would be foolish to try and argue that you won't find more open borders advocates on the left than on the right. But open borders is simply not going to be a part of realistic real-world debate in our lifetimes anymore than universal basic income or a constitutional amendment for campaign finance reform is.
