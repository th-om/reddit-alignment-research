3mzhmu,"""The only difference between the Republican & Democratic party are their social policies""",15,Redtube_Guy,"I forgot where I read or heard this, but I'd say this is pretty true.

Thoughts? Or is the statement wrong?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mzhmu/the_only_difference_between_the_republican/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443631341,1444721421
