5. Immigration is a haphhazard mess at the current time. Immigration has been an enormous boon to America in the past and will be again. Federal resources will be retasked in order to allow for the safe induction of as many people who wish to come be Americans as possible.
6. Immigration only works when immigrants want to be Americans though. Henceforth, no government publications will be in any language but English and English shall be the official state language. English language learning shall be provided free of charge to all who desire it.
7. Federal contracting is a disaster that wastes billions of dollars of tax payer money. A commission will be established on day 1 of this administration to analyze the problem and propose a solution to be enacted within the first 180 days.

Immigration: Open the borders and provide a pathway to legal citizenship for illegal immigrants.

Taxes: Impose a land value tax and carbon tax, abolish the corporate, payroll, and income taxes and replace with a progressive consumption tax. 

Climate Change: Deal with climate change by imposing a carbon tax and cutting red tape for nuclear power; especially newer, more advanced reactors.

Free Market: Push for deregulation, free trade, and abolishing subsidies like agricultural subsidies.

Healthcare: Support a two-tier universal healthcare plan where the state covers all basic medical necessities; citizens who can afford it can purchase private health insurance that has higher quality and better service.

Social Security: Raise retirement age and reduce benefits to wealthy individuals to cut down on costs.

Infrastructure: Spend much more on infrastructure. Boost funding of roads, bridges, railroads, pipes, etc. Modernise infrastructure and use more technology.

Job Training: Invest heavily in more job training. Train people to be mechanics, welders, etc. Reduce inequality by training people at the bottom to find jobs to help themselves up.

Welfare: Replace the whole inefficient, welfare trap riddled current system with a single simple and efficient Negative Income Tax.

**Social Issues:**

Drug War: Legalize and regulate all drugs. Making them illegal just creates a black market, costs a lot of money, and keeps us from regulating it. Abolish mandatory minimums.

Abortion: Support abortion rights, keep abortion legal.

Gay Rights: Support gay marriage and ending discrimination with firing workers because they are gay.

Gun Control: Expand background checks but don't impose strict gun bans.

Euthanasia: Legalize it.

**Foreign Policy:**

Iran Nuclear Deal: Support it. It's not perfect, but it makes sure Iran won't get a nuclear bomb. Other Countries will take off sanctions regardless of whether we approve of this deal or not, so if we don't approve it we will most likely just end up with a worse deal later on.

Military Spending: Maintain a strong military and adequate funding, but cut inefficiencies and wasteful spending.

cv66oq3,1,t3_3lgny5,The_seph_i_am,"I'd run on the concept of holding utilities and infrastructure accountable.  

If able, I'd enforce most rules that allow me to remove corporate loopholes for taxes and in return provide tax incentives to corporations who hire at least 70% US citizens (not H1B) and pay all their employees (even sub-contracted) 5% above the national poverty line as set by the U.S. Board of labor and statistics updated annually.

I'd request congress fund the war on ISIL through a formal declaration of War and would recall all forces until they do.  I'd also call on immediate UN intervention to remove and put to trail all IS members under warcrimes against humanity and pursue and provide funding to that end. I would take a policy of going after the financiers of terrorism, be they cooperate, government or otherwise.  and would treat those that funded terrorist  or supported their funding as terrorists.

I'd pursue methods of removing/eliminating the de facto local monopolies cable ISPs flaunt.  And find methods to strengthen net neutrality rules.  I'd also reinforce the anti propaganda laws so that news agencies would be a source of record instead of a source of entertainment.

I'd work to determine a clear path to citizenship that could be completed in a two-three year process without the need to have a contact in politics or have influence.  During that time, I would demand any illegal in the country wishing to remain in this country would have to immediately begin paying taxes and apply for the program.  They would be given temporary amnesty and would receive rights of a U.S. ""person"" provided they pay taxes.  But if, by the three year mark, they were not on the path to citizenship, they would be deported and the border wall completed.  I'd also require an English proficiency and provide a language course paid for by federal funding.

On the federal level for law enforcement (U.S. Marshals. DEA, FBI, secret service, DHS and the like).  I would require the wear and use of body cameras and limit the DEAs and FBI's ability to use civil assets forfeiture.

Would work to tax and legalize most drugs and remove the cycle of imprisonment the war on drugs has created.  I'd also hold community leaders accountable for their neighborhoods and look deeply into where and how they spend money to ""benefit""  the community.  

While we're on the subject, I'd like to find a way to hold charities accountable as well.  Companies that spend more on advertising and salaries than helping their cause should not receive a tax exempt status. 

At this point, I have likely been assassinated, but if not, I'd look at finding ways to make it easier for the consumer to use solar and wind energy at their home.  And provide tax incentives to car companies that provide hybrid and complete electric family vehicles (minivans and cheap sedans) in the $35K range.

Regarding abortion, I feel life begins at the beginning of the heartbeat.  Which allows for both abortion and stem cell research.  However, once the heartbeat is detected I feel, unless in cases of danger to the mother, adoption is a thing.  That said, I would NOT enact any law or attempt to influence the law in any way regarding the matter unless forced to do so.  I also feel people shouldn't get married just because they have a kid and should be in a very stable situation (both economically and environmentally) before even considering having a kid.  To that end, I would increase funding to foster care and family support services.  But limit CPS involvement in cases where families feel that they can't raise their kids the way they'd like to and have them focus more on safety issues.

Foreign policy wise, I would work to build as many bridges and support infrastructures as we can outside the Middle East.  I'm really tired of dealing with [people](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-saudi-ally-20150929-story.html) that don't understand basic human rights to women or to religion.  And find ways for us to build an industrial infrastructure that rivals China and allows us to start producing real exports again.

I'd quadruple maybe even sextuple NASAs budget.  Because when NASA invents new tech, we all benefit. 

I'd ask colleges and universities to explain in full detail why they're paying their staff so much and yet still need the U.S. Government to help ""pay for tuition"".  When that money just gets turned around and put back into a sports programs.  I think the cost of tuition is absurd and clearly the government throwing money at it hasn't worked because it continues to rise.  I also think that for specialized degrees, you shouldn't have to take 60 hours of gen Ed requirements to complete it when most of those aren't even related to your field of study and would like to see that limited to only 15-20 hours.  Because requiring all those hours is nothing short of extorting the students into paying for courses they don't need.

I'd also like to figure out why so many companies are requiring 8 years job experience in tech field that have only existed for about 4 years.  And like to find those abusing the intern system instead of hiring people for the long term.

I'd do what I could to limit property taxes on individuals who make less than 300,000 dollars a year set to rise with the rate of inflation, and instead encourage a sales tax on luxury goods (items not food, or utilities).  the reasoning behind this is the value of your property does not necessarily, reflect your ability to pay.  For instance, when me an my wife bought our first house, we saved up for years and thanks to a small life insurance settlement from her grandmother, we were able to pay cash on a 116,000 dollar home.  Do you think for a second that a E-5, single income home, could afford to pay a property tax of a little less than 4,000 dollars annually?  heck no!  but that is about the amount we had to pay each year we lived there.  If it was this bad for me with a family and a stable income I can only imagine what it was like for people who are just living pay check to paycheck.

Speaking of federal employment, I'd encourage a four month minimum maternity/paternity leave and give military mothers the option to go on partial paid sabbatical for two years after the birth of their child, with guaranteed re-entry into their previous career with no penalties when they return.  This way, they are under and still can use tricare for those two years.  Should they choose not to return, the partial pay received, must be repaid through installments. medical bills however are waived.


At this I'd most assuredly be killed.  But hell! it was a fun ride.

You seem to be very critical of higher ed. It leaves me wondering how knowledgeable you are about some of the assumptions you've made.
  
You are talking about the increase in administrators. Have you been following studies to this effect? Does it even outpace administration at other educational levels? One reasoning I've learned (albeit in a classroom), is that the opening up of mass education since the 1960s has brought higher ed from something only available to the most highly prepared (almost only rich and highly prepared) individuals in the first half of the 20th century, to something available to a much needier group (less rich, less prepared, less cared for). This has required more infrastructure within schools to cope with the additional needs that faculty are untrained or unwilling to deal with.
   
The total spending on Education at the federal level is around 75 billion. That includes K12 and higher ed, as well as some random stuff like grants for teachers and children of soldiers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, Institute of Sciences, etc.. Compared to other budget items you fly over almost completely, you seem to have a lot of hostility towards colleges.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion
The term extortion is often used metaphorically to refer to usury or to price-gouging, though neither is legally considered extortion. It is also often used loosely to refer to everyday situations where one person feels indebted against their will, to another, in order to receive an essential service or avoid legal consequences.

Okay so extortion may have been a little harsh but usury or price gouging does fit.  Also taking advantage of individuals because they simply don't know better or feel they have no option but to go to college apply as well.  It's the feeling of failure or the inability to escape their lot in life that colleges use in use to give up massive amounts of funds.

cvqgpnq,0,t1_cvqauz6,The_seph_i_am,"> You seem to be very critical of higher ed

I'm only really critical of the cost of college tuition and actions universities take on that position.  To be honest, I think higher education should be made available to all but the amount paid to college executive board members is way too high and the cost paid to the teachers or returned to the actual act of learning is far too low.  I am very certain that the increase in administrators is necessary given increase in people attending but I think many ""board-level"" members are very over paid.

Additionally, I have never been a fan of general education requirements, (with some bias admitted because I didn't do well with them;) but also because they distract from the real reason someone is at that university in the first place.  How am I supposed to figure out if this career-field is right for me if I can't actually spend time studying it because I am focusing on 3 other classes that have nothing to do with my major but everything to do with my GPA?  Now, I am rather pragmatic when it comes to this view as I also recognize the need for people to have varied and broad knowledge subjects but feel that some courses require too much broadening.  All this culminates in a feeling of paying way too much for books I will not use, to be lectured instead of taught, and to get a degree that has no baring in real world when compared to actual experience in the field beyond just getting you in the door. 

My opinion on many universities can be summed up in a quote by Eric Hoffer

> ""Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket"" -

A lot of my opinion is shaped by articles like [this](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-08-18-column18_ST1_N.htm) that state 

> The chief reason why costs keep rising is that education has become a minor player in higher education. At public universities, only 28% of spending goes for instruction; private colleges do a bit better at 33%. 

Many colleges receive a lot of aid at the state, local and federal level, but the cost of going to college continues to [rise.](http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/do-the-math-college-tuition-is-rising-faster-than-inflation/Content?oid=2884601).

This [article](http://www.psmag.com/business-economics/pay-for-decent-teachers-not-dr-phil) paints the case pretty well:

>Too often, the problem begins at the level of the executive board, usually run by representatives of consultancies and hedge funds; the rhetoric, the aggressive but narrow ambition of the corporate world, these become the university's guiding principles

To make matters worse colleges and universities continue to promote more and more gen education requirements that have nothing to do with the major (source personal experience).  Honestly, why did I need 4 different years of a English credits when my major was a technical one?

 All of these tuition hikes result in an even more student [debt](http://www.westernherald.com/opinion/article_4d99ee2e-6776-11e5-b654-df1fbdb1b650.html).

but ask any college professor if they see that rise in tuition result in a bigger paycheck for them and they will likely laugh in your face.

>Have you been following studies to this effect?

Now to be fair, I haven't been following this for very long.  It was only after reading [this](http://theweek.com/articles/549431/where-does-yourtuition-money-time-colleges-answer) article that it got me wondering about the subject at all and that was from this year.  When I was in college I didn't once question any of this because I didn't think it was that bad. Now that I am older and see that a lot of what I received was basically useless facts that I could pull out when trying to impress someone I wonder what it was all for and if the expense was worth it.  And that is what I would like to fix.  To make getting a degree worth it and fun.  To make universities a service based industry where if you don't understand the subject it is on the teacher to help you get to that point where you do not because you didn't spend all of your nights studying and listening to incredibly boring lectures.

cvr8wze,0,t1_cvqgpnq,takingitlikeachamp,"I want to start out by saying that I don't want to be combative. There are some legitimate things to be mad about. Certainly the rise in non-tenured positions, part-time faculty, and grad student teachers in higher ed over full-time tenured positions is a bad one for students. That is my opinion but I think it is one we share. It was also done as a cost-cutting move, but it has had the effect of hurting the profession by making academic jobs less secure and attractive.
  
However, I want to challenge a bunch of what you've thrown out there in hopes that you will think about a few things:
   
>>A lot of my opinion is shaped by articles like this that state
   
That article is terribad. It says that education has become ""a minor player in higher education"", and it points only to the CoE reports from NCES. That's a great source, but if you actually visit the CoE reporting system and learn what that 28% represents, you'll realize it is a shitty measure for looking at what portion of higher ed is ""about educating"". That 28% is purely salaries and benefits for professors (which was still the single largest expense of Universities). That's it. How can you say that's all that goes into educating. Do you want a building to teach in? How about a projector? Blackboard? Chalk? Handouts? None of that is accounted for. What about a library? That's over in the dreaded ""support"" column, which takes up another 20%. The article doesn't take any of this into account, and uses that one measure to try and make a point. The article also discusses research, but somehow puts it into a bad light. Research makes up another 13% of school budgets, but it is a major output of Universities. It is part of what makes a great Professor great, that they know intricately and first hand about a subject they work with. It also boosts the prestige of the University and is what makes students want to attend a flag ship school.
  
>>This article paints the case pretty well
   
This article is also disingenuous. It tries to make a point by presenting the chart showing percentage change in faculty and staff from 1975 to 2011. It does this without even a mention of the biggest factor that might affect a rise in staff and faculty. More Students. http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_303.70.asp
   
Full time enrollment at 4 years has doubled, part-time enrollment doubled. The same thing at 2 year institutions. Schools are also simply being asked to do more for students at their school nowadays. Liability has also played a role in the fact that schools are expected to watch and care for students, and are in danger of law suits if they aren't controlling their environment. That's really just the state of the times in our society. It sucks. I'm not even saying the growth in staff is ""right"". However, the articles you've picked out (and the others I've read), have done a shitty job of pointing out how it is wrong.
   
>>but ask any college professor if they see that rise in tuition result in a bigger paycheck for them and they will likely laugh in your face.
   
Certainly if I ask part-time or non-tenured faculty and we were behind closed doors I completely agree. They have gotten fucked. Colleges have decided tenured prestigious faculty should teach less and research more, while we hire contract faculty that basically have to do more teaching while trying to prove themselves good enough on the research side to become tenured. It sucks. This change in the last 40 years has been a lot about the pressures of increased enrollment, and increased research. Schools want both from their faculty now, and this comes along with all the other pressures on schools to provide services they weren't expected to provide before.
  
I do want to throw out there that I've studied aid to colleges a fair amount, and it's a very mixed bag of results with regard to support. States are still nominally increasing support to colleges (in most years), but that amount has not kept up with enrollment over the long term. Higher Education is also a first order state budget item for cuts, since they are viewed as capable of raising their own revenues which other areas such as Medicaid and Corrections have not. So when a recession hits, higher education is cut first. This happens at the same time as enrollment surges, since in a recession people start valuing education and retraining more than work (that might not exist). So institutions raise tuition to compensate for sagging aid, and are then hit over the head by politicians and journalists for doing so.
  
http://www.acenet.edu/the-presidency/columns-and-features/Pages/state-funding-a-race-to-the-bottom.aspx
  
Part of the reason schools need to bring on executives from hedge funds and big companies, is because they need money from those people. Schools aren't sitting on piles of money. A few might be (Harvard and others with 40 billion in endowments), but not your average 4 year public institution.
   
I'm not sure if I see a way to fix the problem through regulation, and I don't think simply defunding schools will fix things. To regulate your way out of it, you would have to dangle larger financial strings, while using experts in the field from ACE and other groups to set targets for full-time tenured faculty per enrollment load. You would have to put hard caps on sports spending (because I agree that ha been an area of largess completely separate from any educative goal). The only other thing you can do is try to make people aware of what schools pay and hire full-time tenured faculty and use them to actually teach. This is similar to the score card idea that I believe many groups have tried to implement (the president might have even spoken to that recently).

But let me ask this... wouldn't removing many of the gen Ed requirements, effectively reducing the amount credits required, actually assist in freeing up both class sizes, student body, and proffesors because of the added free time. With out the need for as many hours we could lower the hours requirement for full time students giving the students more time to study and maybe even work.  Thereby freeing empowering them to be able to offset the cost of tutution themselves with out the need for government aid?

In the context you mention, it does seem as if it an issue Is being painted to make the administrators seem corrupt and inept.  As I mentioned before I would want 

> universities to explain in full detail why they're paying their staff so much and yet still need the U.S. Government to help ""pay for tuition"". When that money just gets turned around and put back into a sports programs. I think the cost of tuition is absurd and clearly the government throwing money at it hasn't worked because it continues to rise.

But let me clarify, this does not nessesaily mean I would cut funding.  What I would want is a detailed accounting all the money a university spends.  I would want to see what the ""real"" reason is for these coast increases.  As you have already pointed out, these studies, analysis and opinions have bias.  Likely due to the fact whoever produced these studies had something to gain and likely ignored whatever data didn't suit them.  But imagine if the U.S. Government demaded the raw data of an accounting of every pay grade, tenured professor, administrator, every ""effeciency experts"" inputs into educational programs, and compared them to what actually went into the actual act of a student learning a how well they taught those student and how prepared those students were for a real job?

Those universities that do things well and produce students who are knowledgable, hirable, and seek to help even struggling students, who put student learning ahead of say athletics or pet projects or contributing to political campaigns?

 These types of action, namely having universities measured on a metric of the avg sum of their students success and the effort the school puts into accomplishing that, have several secondary actions that occur as a result, at least I think they will.  And would be happy to hear what whether or not you think they will as well:

First- it causes the universities to reevaluate their priorities.  As you mentioned conducting research is huge income for universities and it offsets project costs considerably, not to mention draws in several high caliber students and experts. But if it distracts from their primary purpose of educating the masses what purpose does it serve?  Or if a college is so obsessed with grooming the very best but doesn't bother to help pick up the broken who fail out how is that for the greater good? Those struggling will only end up burdened with debt with not even a paper to show for it.  That's a tab the government will end up picking up latter when that drop out riddled with debt declares bankruptcy (study pending).  Or maybe that school has hired less than honest contractors to handle the meals and dorms or security.  That school would be a lot more considerate of student complaints regarding the matter if they felt they might get asked why they hired them in the first place.(not saying it exists just spit balling ideas here).

Second- it allows everyone to see trend items.  Can you imagine the data anaysis that could be gained if every school in the country had to turn in what worked and didn't work for students.  Or How much each proffesors is paid?  Liberal colleges have been demanding equal pay grades for years through the use of published salaries, can you imagine what would happen if they were to get it?  I imagine many proffesors would be wondering why the one bastard in polipsych who teaches one class a year makes twice as much as anyone else.  And that's just the tip.  New Learning techniques, methods of teaching, several new learning theory models would be developed in a very short amount of time.  And as learning methods improve so does the rate we educate, which means colleges are able to handle that increase in students.  Which means the cost of tuition can in fact go down.  Which mean the government can pay for more of your college.  (Doesn't that sound nice?)

Three- it lets us see objectively who uses the money in ways that truely benefit the country.   And if someone could do better compared to a college in the same situation we can help them find ways to improve.

Fourth-  now this reason is likely the one you were concerned with- collecting this data does in fact make it easier to say ""you know what? this place doesn't help us, it has lost its way, and seeks only to harm, and it needs to stop"". 

But this would likely only be a small amount of schools.  Think of the very worst of the stereotypical ""for profit"" schools.

As I mentioned at the beginning of my soapbox rant. I'd run on a platform of accountability.  That doesn't just mean law enforcement or social programs, or energy sector, or communications, lawmakers and tech, it means education, it means prison systems, it means our business partners, this is our future.  And it means everything and everyone that the tax payers pay for should be held accountable.  And whether you're religious or not you will likely agree with this next part, 

> Luke 16:10
> “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.

So allow me to clarify further.  Just because I want accountability does not mean I want heads on a platter.  I just want whatever money that is supposed to help our future actually go towards that and not some investment banker or academic elitist that has no more baring/compassion on the students in his class than than a rock does.  I want to reward those who make a effort to do good and I want to empower

cvsjp2p,0,t1_cvs4i7w,takingitlikeachamp,"> You're right you and I have very similar leanings on these subjects. But let me ask this... wouldn't removing many of the gen Ed requirements, effectively reducing the amount credits required, actually assist in freeing up both class sizes, student body, and proffesors because of the added free time. With out the need for as many hours we could lower the hours requirement for full time students giving the students more time to study and maybe even work. Thereby freeing empowering them to be able to offset the cost of tutution themselves with out the need for government aid?
   
I'm not sure of your political leanings, but you are talking about what colleges should be doing with their own curriculum. That isn't really a decision that should be up to anyone other than the college leadership and faculty. I'm not interested in micro-managing college affairs, which is what you are proposing we do. I've already put forward to you that the actual federal funding provided to higher education is 75 billion between what is provided by the Department of Education, and what is provided through research grants.
  
http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2015/06/federal-and-state-funding-of-higher-education
   
Notice that very little federal money actually goes to schools directly. It goes to students who use it on school. So if you are unhappy with the Gen Ed requirements of your state school, go to a tech school where you can get a Certificate in some career field and never take a course on something you don't want to. I think you are overlooking that colleges are autonomous organizations of academic faculty and professionals. They don't just tack on classes willy-nilly. They decide how much they want their students to know about Writing, Math, Science, Languages, and Cultural study, in addition to the specific area of concentrated study the student is interested in. The University of Michigan has an interest in knowing that every graduate can read and write to a certain standard, has a base knowledge of Statistics or Calculus, and has spent at least some time thinking about the world in a global sense. If they decide those things are important, than they decide that every UMich student will have that set of skills and take the appropriate coursework.
   
Once you actually get into the weeds in most industries, you find out that ""holding ________ accountable"" is often a lot harder than it seems. 
  
>What I would want is a detailed accounting all the money a university spends. I would want to see what the ""real"" reason is for these coast increases
   
You put the word real in quotes as if there is a nefarious motive to increases in the cost of education. Even if that were true, an accounting of expenses wouldn't reveal nefarious motives for spending. Look up the Delta Cost Project for instance. That is a great attempt to account for spending trends in higher education institutions, but it still doesn't really tell you ""what works"".
   
> But imagine if the U.S. Government demaded the raw data of an accounting of every pay grade, tenured professor, administrator, every ""effeciency experts"" inputs into educational programs, and compared them to what actually went into the actual act of a student learning a how well they taught those student and how prepared those students were for a real job?
   
Two points here. You realize that every public college in the nation publishes pretty much all the data you've asked for right?
https://www.suny.edu/govtrelations/state/new-york-state-budget/
   
Public colleges have public budgets that break down expenses to a per office level.
  
I hope you also realize that ""measuring student learning"" is an entire academic field. Many authors have made it their life's work to try and examine the connection between spending in academic areas and student learning outcomes, but it is an incredibly complex field. Even if you wanted to start aggregating all of this information to a federal level. Who sets the target for what is learning? Who evaluates the 6,000 institutional reports? Who decides what institutions get less aid and how that will happen? This is a massive undertaking. Not to mention there are Thinktanks and state-level groups trying to do exactly what you are suggesting.

> Can you imagine the data anaysis that could be gained if every school in the country had to turn in what worked and didn't work for students.
   
I work in the field of education data analysis. The problem is that a lot of the data you are asking to be collected won't tell us about what ""works for students"", since that is an incredibly ambiguous term. I'm not even sure if you are talking about satisfaction, actual learning metrics. Is that compared to a per dollar of spending? What about other outputs for the University balanced against those learning metrics?
   
>But this would likely only be a small amount of schools. Think of the very worst of the stereotypical ""for profit"" schools. (Given your level of research you likely know better than I and one probably immediately came to mind). Now imagine the U.S. Government saying, ""you know what? That place sucks, we will not enable them to rip off more people and will deney tuition assistance to anyone foolish enough to be coerced by them. And instead recommend they go to a place better suited for them that will get them on a truely solid career path""
   
For profit schools are cancer. That's pretty much my view on the matter. Has ITT tech helped some people get a good education, sure. However, we already have a lot more control over public colleges offering similar technology study for A LOT cheaper. There have been endless studies about the downsides of for-profit colleges, mostly related to very poor graduation rates and huge debt (far beyond public colleges) on a per student basis where in a lot of cases the student doesn't even leave with a degree. I feel this is due a lot to the fact that public colleges have no incentive to keep you there if you are not performing. Private schools on the other hand profit off of continued enrollment, especially if you are failing some courses and will need to stay even longer. You could argue that public colleges also want to keep high enrollment, but on an administrator or faculty level, no one in the public service is worried about school level retention to the point of trying to keep failing students in school long after their expected graduation date.
   
I'm honestly commenting at this point to try and make a little common ground. There are actually a fair amount of groups trying to get accountability in Education. Look at the Texas link I shared above. States are (and have been) taking a keen interest in holding higher ed accountable. They are using some of the data you have suggested. However, at the federal level, I don't think this is going to bear a lot of fruit. 
  
1. You would have to invest more money in this layer of accountability. Auditors, Education Scientists, Congressional Committees, etc. More bureaucracy. More reporting. If you don't fund it (unfunded mandate), then schools will all be adding layers of bureaucracy which will increase their budgets and likely drive tuition up.
   
All of this to shave a few billion from the 75 we spend. Even if you took 25% of all this funding away, you would save maybe 10 or 20 billion. This would take years of study, 100s of millions if not over a billion in federal spending (maybe more). All to cover ground that is being covered by Thinktanks and states which have more invested in pretty much every sense in the higher education game.
  
2. Asking the question of what is learning and what is a good education, is like asking what is security, and what is being safe. It's an incredibly complex question that people have been trying to answer for centuries. Even a ""win"" like you're talking about won't make much a difference in the federal budget, and will likely not make much of a difference in the education students receive.
   
I'm all for accountability in education, but if you are trying to make a national campaign on it, you should really put the focus on the areas in which the federal government spends a lot AND is directly responsible for the results. I want to see this fervor put towards Medicaid and Medicare fraud, Defense related waste, HHS service provision. We spend so much more in these areas and are so much more deeply involved in them, that saving 5% through accountability schemes might actually yield a fair chunk of change.

These are appealing to someone who sees the unfair representation we have but don't know much about the history and purpose of the Senate, and who the Senate represents. The Senate was created to represent the interest of the State governments, not as much the people within them. This has been muddied since the passing of the 17th amendment, which created the direct election of Senators - before this, they were appointed by the State Legislatures, which meant that there was a direct and powerful interest in states rights in the federal government. Laws such as the [National Minimum Drinking Age Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act), which withholds highway funding from states that don't set a drinking age of 21, would never have passed a state-appointed Senate. Now, we have a Senate that is in an awkward middle-ground. They don't have to answer to the states they supposedly represent, and they can be easily influenced by outside interests. It's really unclear what the Senate's function is supposed to be now. For this reason, I strongly support a repeal of the 17th amendment. 

>lower the requirements for constitutional amendments.

I fully support our society doing a better job of utilizing the constitutional amendment process, but I don't think we need to make it easier to do so directly. Perhaps every 10 years or so, every state legislature would have to vote on whether or not to hold a convention, to help facilitate change if it is a popular idea. That's just my own idea.

>I'm also not opposed to limiting the commerce clause but don't know enough about the ramifications or in which ways to limit it. 

You're pretty spot on with this. The commerce clause has expanded so wide it's basically a catch-all without any real meaning. However, it's impossible to know just what the ramifications of changing it would be at this point- a ton of laws and an insane amount of bureaucracy exists because of SCOTUS's commerce clause rulings, that suddenly nullifying them would be pretty damaging.

My campaign would focus on rhetoric over policy. Unlike other 3rd party candidates I don't need to make a powerful statement to get my face on TV.

The main theme of the campaign would be that the system is broken. That's a platitude that nearly everyone can agree on. The corollary of that is ""change,"" a slogan that worked very well for Obama.

Policy would focus on ""common sense"" solutions. These would pander almost exclusively to the center. Neither end of the political spectrum alone is enough to carry an election, and it would be difficult to get both conservatives and liberals to support the same candidate.

1 - economy & environment.

We need a jobs program and we need to revamp our infrastructure to be more environmentally friendly.  These two things dovetail nicely.  We can look at updating our energy grid and building green energy infrastructure such as solar farms, nuclear power plants, and wind farms.  Where prudent, encourage more public transportation and/or use of bicycles.  Install smartgrids so that when individuals with solar panels put energy into the grid their contributions can be tracked and reimbursed.  

2 - military and defense.

We need to right-size our military.  We do need a military.  Defense is important.  But we spend almost half the world's entire military budget and it's bleeding us dry.  Do we need aircraft carriers?  Yes!  Do we need more than the entire rest of the world combined?  No!  We have 7 times as many of them as 2nd place.  

**We are in this weird place where we are actually spending more than even the military leadership itself wants.  This is because we are using military spending as a jobs program instead of having actual jobs programs** ( see point 1 ).  Legislators will pass spending bills for expensive hardware over the objection of the military brass because the components come from their state and create jobs.  Even Bernie Sanders voted to fund the unwanted, wasteful, f-35 because it was going to have parts built in Burlington - the town he had served as mayor in - and create jobs there.  

This is better than no jobs program at all, but is an incredibly inefficient way to create jobs.  The output of the military machine is, after all, destruction.  Not infrastructure.  And because so much of the military is overseas - in over 1,200 military bases worldwide - we lose a lot of the secondary effects of a formal jobs program at home.  When a bunch of privates go out for drinks in Germany, for example, they inject money into the German economy rather than ours.  

And of course, when you have a really big hammer all sorts of things start looking like nails that really aren't nails so we start doing stupid things with guns instead of smart things with trade and words.  

But the big point here is that we face a hell of a fight if we just try to pull the plug on wasteful military spending because every legislator will want to defend the jobs in their state that rely on military $$$$.  Which is why you make it a package deal with the direct jobs program so that more jobs are created than lost.
