SCAAP illegal alien incarcerations in fiscal year 2008 were related to three
offenses: drugs, traffic violations, and assault.

>Additionally, the total number of SCAAP illegal aliens incarcerated in Arizona state prisons in fiscal year 2008 was about 6,000, which accounted for about 11 percent of all inmate days.

For immigrants in general (both legal and illegal):

>In fiscal year 2005, the criminal alien population in federal prisons was around 27 percent the total inmate population, and from fiscal years 2006 through 2010 remained consistently around 25 percent.

So, the percent of the Arizona's population that are illegal immigrants is around 6%, yet they're 11% of Arizona's prison population. The percent of total legal immigrants is around 13% (and 16% including illegals), yet they're 25% of the federal prison population.

To determine the latter you would have to do more of an ethnography, and if racial bias is found then the statistics are useful in that regard as well.

On the other hand, you have to look at immigrant's place within the economy, and where they are allowed in or excluded. If they are in large part excluded from the formal economy, they must then subsist in the informal or underground economy which, since unregulated, is prone to much more violent, property and drug-related crime. This could also account for the statistics. 

My point being, and this may not be counter to what you were trying to say (perhaps I am misinterpreting or generalizing), statistics do not become useless once several explanations arise for them. It is just as likely a theory that the high incarceration rates of Mexicans are caused by their greater involvement in criminal activity, as it is that the police are racially biased, and/or that undocumented immigrants find themselves subsisting within the informal, more crime-ridden economy.

Plus on page 40, there is a section on why relying on the US census may be flawed.  That also confirms my statement about the US Federal government not actually tracking statistics on immigrant crime.  

Plus both studies are performed by the same people using the same type of Census data.

Also, Table 2. in both studies are interesting (just looking at 1980 column for this example).  The 1st study from 2007, lists the number of observations of native born incarceration at 1,900,111.  The 2nd study from 1997, which only accounts for males 18-40, lists observations at 839,839.  On the immigrant side the 2007 study lists observations at 127,392.  The 1997 study is 136,221.

Not conclusive, so let's look at a few more numbers. Since most crimes are committed by males between 18 and 39 let's look at incarceration numbers. 1.6% of foreign-born males are in jail, compared with 3.3% of the native-born population.

There are plenty of statistics to suggest that immigrants are responsible for a lower % of crime than natives, but not much supporting the opposite. Trump cited federal prison sentences to support his stance, but only a few % of violent crimes are handled by the federal system.

It's all based on that kind of data.  We know if we are dealing with a serial killer, for example, the odds overwhelmingly favor the killer being an American, white male with income between 50 and 80k a year and is single.

And, for dealing with racial makeups of crimes or even crimes by nationality, you don't boil things down to cities or counties.  You look nationally, then you correlate rates, not net incidents, to local arrests to determine if the trend is solid enough to base new protocol on.  

Take a look here, for instance...

http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/JAR_Display.asp?ID=qa05261

Let's just give a summary of their findings...

>The Violent Crime Index arrest rate in 2012 for black juveniles (575) was 5 times the rate for white (111) youth, 6 times the rate for American Indian juveniles (94), and 12 times the rate for Asian juveniles (47).
  
>In the 1980s, the Violent Crime Index arrest rate for black juveniles was 6 times the white rate. This ratio declined during the 1990s, holding at 4 to 1 from 1998 to 2004. Since 2004, the racial disparity in the rates increased, averaging about 5 to 1 in the last 10 years.

If we see that data nationally we would then pull as many county and city records as we could and see if the national trend holds true locally as well.  And, it does, almost universally regardless of poverty. 

Now, I'm not saying poverty doesn't play a role.  It does.  But, it's impact is on **net** crimes or crimes per capita, not rate by race or nationality.  Even taking a rich neighborhood with few arrests you'll find the same races and nationalities over-represented for certain types of crimes.  This is an issue of rates by race and nationality, not what you mentioned which would be net crimes by location.

When you get down to doing what FBI ""profilers"" do in the field, you start taking into account the local demographic makeup of the population, and that's a different field I don't work in.  But, when it comes to what I do, I give data that says when I look at someone that if they are guilty of a crime it's likely one of these specific things.  And, I'm right, almost all of the time.  I'd say my failure rate is probably no greater than 3%, and even then the investigative process will most often reveal that we are dealing with an outlier very early in the investigation.  

Ultimately, though, there's no way to escape the fact that certain races, ages, genders, and nationalities do commit more crimes than others, and if you bring in a bunch of immigrants, particularly a high concentration of them all with a similar demographic makeup, you're going to see a spike in specific crimes related to the trends of that demographic.  What I can't understand is why people are resistant to that. 

It's this simple.  If orange Koozbanians commit the crime of forgery at 12 times the rate of the next closest group, then you bring in five million Koozbanians into your population, you're going to get a huge spike in the number of forgeries that will mirror the trend you already had in your data.

>Additionally, the total number of SCAAP illegal aliens incarcerated in Arizona state prisons in fiscal year 2008 was about 6,000, which accounted for about 11 percent of all inmate days.

So illegal immigrants are estimated to be between 3-4% of the population, but make up 11% of Arizona's prison population.
