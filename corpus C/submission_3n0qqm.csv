3n0qqm,"Conservatives know why they are angry about politics, so what are liberals/progressives angry about?",15,garfangle,"The American electorate is in a foul mood. Even though the economy has recovered from the Great Recession most Americans think we are headed in the wrong direction.

Conservatives blame Obama and Congressional establishment Republicans for not doing more to obstruct his actions on everything from Obamacare to immigration to the federal budget and our 19 trillion dollar debt. This has manifested in the support for non-politicians like Trump, Carson, and Fiorina in the 2016 GOP presidential race.

I am unsure what liberals/progressives are angry about that effects the realm of politics. Sure, Sanders complains about income inequality and the Black Lives Matter movement is frustrated over what they perceive to be unjustified killings of blacks by the police. However, their critique seems awkward politically given that Obama has been in the president for the past six+ years and that most of the police brutality cases have occurred under Democratic city governance like in New York and in Ferguson, MO.

It's hard to complain about not being heard when the party you support controls the levers of government. At least with the case of conservatives, they had a presidential veto to contend with as to why their priorities were not addressed.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3n0qqm/conservatives_know_why_they_are_angry_about/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443648782,1444721286
