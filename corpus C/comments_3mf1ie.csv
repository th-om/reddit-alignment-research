I don't think you know what the word 'force' means

Or the word 'free'

Traditionally cities were dirty , unhealthy places where death rates exceeded the birth rate. But then it shot up after sanitation/sewers etc were implemented.

The problem is that fundamentally people have this mentally of ""things can't possible be worse than today"" and then proceed to extrapolate the middle ages as being better for the average person.",3,0,1443297931,1444723514

cvfie0h,1,t3_3mf1ie,Lelorinel,"You are aware that the entire modern concept of property ownership happened as a progression away from feudalism, right?   
   
1. Lords grant tenants land in exchange for fealty and military service.   
2. Tenants agitate and gain right for their land to pass to their heirs on death, rather than back to lord.   
3. As kingdoms move from feudal to professional armies, tenants gain option to pay fixed rent to lord instead of providing soldiers.   
4. Tenants agitate and gain right to give (or sell) their title to another person.   
5. Fixed rent becomes negligible with inflation, vassalage dead, land bought up and enclosed for pasture.   
6. The serfs/peasants who had been working the tenants' land the whole time move to cities for a better lot, freedom.   
   
That's a crude butchery, but you get the idea. Your system would require legal mechanisms to keep people on the land and in their places- such a system once existed, and people moved away from it because they didn't like it very much.
