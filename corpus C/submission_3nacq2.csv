3nacq2,"Why ""more guns"" would have possibly stopped the Oregon shooter",13,garfangle,"This is a simple argument that allowing people to have more guns available on their person would have possibly stopped the Oregon shooter.

Imagine your one of his intended victims he rounded up in a group who is asked to declare your faith before he shoots you. You say: ""Can I get out my bible before I reply?""

He says: ""Fine.""

You reach into your backpack and pull out your gun you had carried concealed. You shoot at him. Maybe you hit him or maybe not. However, he is distracted enough that someone is able to get up and tackle him. You then point the gun at the shooter and yell: ""Stop, I've got a gun.""

The now engaged shooter has a choice of complying or being shot himself. If he is suicidal and starts to point the gun back at you, you shoot him at point blank range. If he drops his gun, you then shout out loud while still pointing your gun at him: ""Call the cops. I've got this guy detained.""

The police arrive to the scene and you declare: ""I've got the gunman."" They order you to drop your gun which you do. They then arrest the shooter instead of have to engage in the gunfight which ultimately brought him down.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nacq2/why_more_guns_would_have_possibly_stopped_the/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443828995,1444720109
