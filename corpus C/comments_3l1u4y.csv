Even more hypothetically, if elected I expect Trump would be terrible at the job of President, mostly due to a lack of political experience. Carson would probably be a lousy VP for the same reason.
 
Realistically, the chances of it happening are nil - combined, they have [zero endorsements](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/) from members of the Republican Party.

Either one needs an experienced Senator on his ticket, preferable a veteran Washington insider with a shit ton of foreign policy experience, maybe John McCain or Lindsey Graham if either can convince them.

This out ways picking a running mate to ""deliver"" a key State, so neither should try Bush or Kasich, probably Rubio too.
