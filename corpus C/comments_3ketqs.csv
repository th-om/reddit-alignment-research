Civil disobedience is something that can only be done by a civilian.

The Supreme Court has issued him an order to either carry out the duties of his post, or permit the Vice President to act in his place, but the President counters that it is unconstitutional that he be forced to do something against his beliefs, nor allow someone else to do so in his place.

Is this an act of civil disobedience?",1,0,1441899852,1444730454
cuwul94,0,t1_cuwu3ae,IUhoosier_KCCO,"hmm interesting example.

i think your example and the kim davis situation are both related. however, i would not call either civil disobedience. if you are elected to a position that requires you to perform a duty, you either perform that duty or resign.

if kim davis wanted to resign and then stand outside the county clerk's office and block any (gay) couple from getting married, then i'd consider that civil disobedience. do it on your own time and dime. but both the president and county clerk are elected positions and you have an oath to uphold. imagine if police officers started choosing certain laws not to enforce (the police take a similar oath to elected officials). i wouldn't call that very civil. and i think the same applies to kim davis and the president in your example.

cuww960,0,t1_cuwul94,popname,"> if you are elected to a position that requires you to perform a duty, you either perform that duty or resign.

I think there's a very important distinction in this example.  A president campaigns for that position knowing that he might have to execute a war.  Davis campaigned for her position when the potential of being involved in a gay marriage did not exist.  Because of a change in law while she was in that position she was forced to confront a conflict with her conscience.  The difference is, Davis took her position in good faith, not with the intent of obstructing the then-current responsibilities of her office.

This is meaningful to me when considering if Davis' actions are civil disobedience.  I don't think it affects whether she should be compelled to carry out the new duties of her position.  I think she should.

>if kim davis wanted to resign and then stand outside the county clerk's office and **block any (gay) couple from getting married**, then i'd consider that civil disobedience.

you're right - there is definitely a distinct difference. however, in both cases, they should resign if they can't fulfill their duties.
