Carson identifies as an Evangelical Christian (IIRC) and most of that crowd tends to have...interesting ideas about the age of the earth. In that respect he's not significantly different than most of the other candidates.",10,0,1442547434,1444727276

Now, his expertise is in medicine, so whether or not he should have credibility in policy decisions is a different argument. But when you're a perspective GOP voter, you most likely are already believe in Creation, you most likely already believe homosexuality is a choice. These positions aren't turning away any voters. His calm demeanor and medical credentials are attractive though; he's not ""Washington"" but unlike Trump he doesn't scream and yell; in fact he does the opposite.

When looking at candidates, I find the best way to evaluate them is by what factions in the party the appeal to, and the widest appealing ones will perform best. Carson can tie together the anti-establishment sentiment with the evangelical vote, all while appealing to moderates because of his background in the sciences (it gives him a more level headed vibe).
