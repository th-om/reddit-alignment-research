Hopefully I'm able to explain this in a way that's understandable because I think what you explained is a common misunderstanding from those on the RTW side on the basis of freedom of association.

What right to work laws do is outlaw ""union security agreements"" from being included in collectively bargained agreements between an employer and a union. These are an agreement between the employer and the labor union that the employer will only hire unionized employees. These agreements are entered into by two consenting parties (company and union), under their own will. 

The prospective employee has no right to associate with the employer on whatever terms they please. If the employer decides that they only want to associate with (hire) union members, because they decided to contractually agree to that, they should have the right to do that. After all, we do agree that they should have the right to associate or disassociate as they please and to enter into contracts with other parties, I hope.

It's not so much different from entering into a contract with a company to be your exclusive supplier of a raw input for your process. We wouldn't force the company to purchase from other suppliers, or lone wolf individuals trying to sell the same raw input. Forcing companies to hire non-union members when they otherwise would contractually agree not to is essentially the same thing.  

Union membership is simply a term of employment that the employer has set. If you don't like this term of employment, you are free to not associate with that employer and go find another who's terms of association you find more agreeable. 

So I ask you, why is it okay to force a company to associate with an employee that they do not want to?",1,0,1442370079,1444728150

> After all, we do agree that they should have the right to associate or disassociate as they please and to enter into contracts with other parties, I hope.

But this isn't the case. See Civil Rights Act of 1964. So why apply a concept that doesn't exist and try to use it as a reason for applying a current law?

> So I ask you, why is it okay to force a company to associate with an employee that they do not want to?

I don't think it is. But 99% of people do (see civil rights act again). Labor unions are a barrier. That's all they are. They aren't a business deciding who to get into a contract with. They aren't a citizen deciding who to get into a contract with. 

A business should be allowed to hire/not hire anyone they want. They should NOT be allowed to require you to associated with a separate ""organization"" as a requirement for employment.

I'm simply opposed to the concept of ""exclusive representation"" as it only takes a majority vote for employees to be stripped of their right to bargain. Hence why I support right to work. ",1,0,1442371363,1444728150

You don't actually believe that as you don't want businesses to be able to hire only union workers.

No, it doesn't. As far as I'm aware, all 50 states are at will employment. That means the employer can change the terms of your employment at anytime. If on Friday union membership isn't required and over the weekend the owner enters into a deal with a labor union with a USA in it, then come Monday the terms of your employment have changed. You can choose to accept those new terms or not, but you don't have some kind of right to employment on the terms you choose for as long as you feel like having those terms.",1,0,1442372446,1444728150

""Protected classes"" are a restriction on what reasons a business can disassociate with. You declared we should be free to disassociate with who we please. We aren't. I think it's relevant.

> You don't actually believe that as you don't want businesses to be able to hire only union workers. 

A business should be able to choose to hire only union workers. That is their right. **BUT there shouldn't be a law that says that other employees CAN'T apply. That's the difference.** And a huge one in my opinion. 

I'm not even sure what you are saying. In right to work states, a business is still free to hire only union members. (Please tell me what restrictions there are that say otherwise). They just can't have that restriction written in law. 

>I'm simply opposed to the concept of ""exclusive representation"" as it only takes a majority vote for employees to be stripped of their right to bargain.
> No, it doesn't. 

What doesn't? Exclusive representation means workers are stripped of their bargaining rights. Workers VOTE on this. A majority vote win. Therefore you can be stripped of your bargaining rights even if you don't want to lose them. Now you are forced to pay an agncy fee to the union that took your rights against your will or quit. 

> You can choose to accept those new terms or not, but you don't have some kind of right to employment on the terms you choose for as long as you feel like having those terms.

There is a difference between changing terms and taking rights away. My point is that you should never be forced to lose your rights or to quit your job. You are proposing that businesses should be able to require that you pay an outside organization a certain amount or quit. And off the topic of right to work, you shouldn't be stripped of your bargaining rights either.",3,0,1442374911,1444728150

You can opt to go work somewhere else with work conditions you find more palatable such as not requiring you to be in a union. You don't get to demand a job on whatever terms you please. If you don't want to be in a union, go get a job somewhere that isn't a union shop.
