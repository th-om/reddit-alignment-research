cvhnmqw,1,t3_3ms5yg,the_blue_wizard,"I think he is saying, that we let the skill of an actor determine if he is fit for a given role. Matt Damon played a gay guy. Who could have done it better given the gay guy he was playing?

Equally there are gay actors who play straight characters convincingly. Let's say ...Rock Hudson. Though there are many others. 

If the person can not sufficient disappear into the character, then they are not sufficient actors for that role. If the 'gay' shows through, then that person does not have sufficient acting skill. 

But equally, the opposite is true. If you are playing a Gay Character and the Straight shows through, then you're not the right actor. 

As to Politics, actors live in the same world that we all do, they are all effected by things that effect the nation. They have every right to have their voices heard, and given that they have a much larger world stage to speak on, the almost have an obligation to speak out on important issues.

cvi3jcp,0,t1_cvhnmqw,ThisisClambake,"You are right about the gay/straight actor stuff, but I don't think it makes sense that these people should be obligated to speak on political issues or even encouraged to.  It just furthers the national group think, and people should really be learning critical thinking. If someone is a role model in a specific area (like being a famous actor), people are going to blindly agree with what they do even outside of their actual area of expertise.  The opinions of famous people are not better just because they can reach more people with them.  They should be treated just like anybody else's. You are advocating for the ongoing appeal to authority that already exists to an unhealthy degree in this country.  If I want to know shit about acting I'll listen to a famous actor. Otherwise they can fuck off back to the big screen.",2,0,1443537410,1444722595

To express your personal beliefs on a national or global stage is to open your beliefs to criticism in a national or global level. Any popular artist must weigh the pros and cons of doing so, and many that openly express strong opinions on politics or religion do it in a way that accents their career.

cvhonag,1,t3_3ms5yg,BuckminsterJones,"I don't think you can have too much citizen involvement in politics, and famous people are citizens who happen to have a camera pointed at them. I like it when famous people at least try to have something to say when they have a camera pointed at them. Sure, they're not always too bright, but they normalize us citizens speaking our minds. They set a good example. If Matt Damon has spurred you to political activism either for or against some position of his? Then cool. That's democracy.

It that belief restricted to only actors or does it also apply to Country Singers and TV Personalities as well?

cvi3125,1,t3_3ms5yg,MrFrode,">“I think it must be really hard for actors to be out publicly,” he continues. “But in terms of actors, I think you’re a better actor the less people know about you period. And sexuality is a huge part of that. Whether you’re straight or gay, people shouldn’t know anything about your sexuality because that’s one of the mysteries that you should be able to play.”

First off I can find Damon saying what you suggest he says in any interview.

Second, I think he's saying that the less people know about the actor the more they see the role the actor is playing. When you go to a Tom Cruise movie are you 100% involved in the character or are you enjoying Tom Cruise?

He seems not to be saying that gay actors need to play straight or straight actors gay to be a good actor but the less well known you are the more you have to produce in the role, because you can't fall back on your personal popularity to saw an average performance.

But that's just my take.

cvhywug,1,t3_3ms5yg,ClimateMom,"I get what he's saying about a certain amount of mystery being beneficial for actors - some actors are so familiar that you can't really separate their characters from their public persona - but he picked a pretty lousy example. Are actors just not supposed to date people or get married? Sooner or later, sexuality is something that *will* come out, and gay actors shouldn't have to hide their sexuality just to get non-gay roles. ",1,0,1443527295,1444722607
