cvecdpa,1,t3_3me0he,garyp714,">[The cyclical theory refers to a model used by historian Arthur Schlesinger to attempt to explicate the fluctuations in politics throughout American History. Liberalism and conservatism are rooted in the “national mood” that shows a continuing shift in national involvement between public purpose and private interest. Each of these cycles includes a phase of dominant public interest, a transition phase, and a phase of prevalent private interest.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclical_theory)

IMHO, America has been doing a cyclical dance where it very slowly moves from leaning conservative to leaning progressive.  These 'eras' are in roughly 40 year patterns and rest in the mood of the American electorate.

Post WWII was pretty progressive - SS, medicare, medicaid, VRA, EPA, FDA, largest expansion of government in history, highest tax rates, union dominating, etc etc. 

Then as always happens, progressivism overreached and began to get extreme and grated on the nerves of the populace so began the very slow trek back to the conservative side in the 70s.  By the 80s conservatism was roundly favored - Reagan, Morning in America, trickle down, greed is good, just say no, war on drugs, tough on crime, deregulation, tax cuts for job creators, etc etc.

But then around the 00s conservatism jumped the shark.  Bush's two wars and 'compassionate conservatism' along with Katrina and the biggest financial meltdown started the cyclical move back to the left (I would say the movement back to the left started with Obama) and here we are 7 years later robustly moving towards progressivism.  I say in 5 years we will be in a full on progressive era- income inequality, legalization, gay rights, etc etc

And just as it always does, the country will grow tired of progressivism and start it's move back to conservatism, probably in and around 2030s.

This stuff is so obvious that Presidents and their campaign people campaign and govern with these cycles in mind.  This is why both Bill Clinton and Obama had to use triangulation to get anything done.  

Great book on President's governing with these cycles in mind:

""Presidential Leadership in Political Time: Reprise and Reappraisal"" - Stephen Skowronek 

Or if you want to go down the rabbit hole on just how comically cyclical we are as human beings check out:

""Generations"" and especially ""The Fourth Turning"" both by Strauss and Howe.

Once you realize you are part of a group that repeats the same four reactionary generational personalities every 80 years, it makes it easier to see why things are so chaotic right now (conservatives are losing their favor, progressives are gaining that favor) and can enjoy the ride for what it is.",1,0,1443226473,1444723550

cveg5qv,1,t3_3me0he,CUDawg30,"The so called Progressive Movements don't have the staying power in American history. They come and go throughout the history of this nation. Usually its around for a decade or two and then the movement evaporates as the next generation after them comes of age. Socialist Progressives will be a force in the Democratic Party for a while but eventually the majority Party will move back to the Center-Left instead of the Full Left. History tells us this will happen.  

I do believe that the Libertarians will regain control of the Republican Party in the near future. At the very least the Party will come back to the Center-Right. The Social Conservatives the way we know them today really didn't see a rise inside the Republican Party until the Republican Revolution in 1994. That is when the Social Conservatives really gained control of the Party and the Deep South governments. This moved the Social Conservatives away from the center and to the extreme of the Right. Before 1994 the Social Conservatives had to unite with the Democratic Conservative to have any real power in Congress. The Republican Revolution in 1994 ended the bipartisan Conservative Coalition of conservative Republicans and Democrats (Boll weevil Democrats).",0,0,1443234454,1444723550
