>Disclaimer: I live in a college town in the north east.

So, probably, yes.

Bernie is very popular among a very specific demographic, and you appear to be in the heart of it.

Now, he is mentioned in the media plenty, at least on CNN, and will on the late show on Friday, but he's a guy that's trailing by 20-30 points nationally and within the margin of error of a guy who isn't running for president.",29,0,1442491359,1444727644
cv4l1as,1,t3_3lajcf,ClockOfTheLongNow,"In 1972, there was a New York film critic quoted as saying ""I live in a rather special world. I only know one person who voted for Nixon. Where they are I donâ€™t know.""  We've seen it misparaphrased in more popular forms as ""How could Nixon have won? Nobody I know voted for him,"" and that's basically what you're experiencing right now in reverse.  You spend time on reddit, you spend time in like-minded communities, and that bubble skews your perception.

Bernie Sanders is losing nationally and, perhaps more importantly, is losing in a number of states.  There are the random one-off polls that show him doing well against Republican challengers (a useless measure given how split the current Republican primary is), but Bernie Sanders, at least right now, is not in a good position to win the nomination at all, never mind the general election.",16,0,1442491693,1444727644

cv4lsa6,1,t3_3lajcf,Captainobvvious,"Being on Reddit and social media is enough to skew many people's view on the election as it is. Adding to that the fact that you're living in a liberal college town it must REALLY seem like he's the most popular candidate in modern history. Taking a stroll to /r/politics you would think he's the front runner and only getting stronger and Clinton is hated by everyone. 

The reality is that he doesn't have much of a chance at all of being the nominee. He's popular with a very specific group of mostly white liberal democrats and as the other name on the poll that isn't Clinton that they can pick. 

He's up in New Hampshire and fighting a good fight in Iowa but those have long been considered his best bets to win anything.

I can go into more detail if wanted but there are many reasons he simply isn't a contender for the nomination. It just isn't going to happen. 

Long story short he's popular on Reddit and social media and that creates a bubble for his young supporters to think he's doing better and is more widely popular than he is. Bernie fever isn't sweeping the nation. ",9,0,1442493661,1444727651

All that being said, I don't think he's really running to win.  He just wants the national stage to preach his brand of progressive social democracy from, in the hopes of pushing the Democractic party to the left and undermining the influence of the more moderate liberals.

And that's why the Republicans don't talk about him.  He's an interesting candidate that is have a real impact, but that impact is mostly on internal DNC politics.  To the Democrats, he's an important figure in setting the ideological course of the party, whether or not he wins.  To the Republicans, he's just some irrelevant guy they probably aren't going to have to run against anyway.  Republican don't care about Sanders any more than Sanders worries himself with the internal struggle between the establishment and the Tea Party on the right.",-1,0,1442502296,1444727659
