3l5tdi,Does anyone know where I can find the first democratic debate online?,11,MrFoenBox,"I kept reminding myself to catch it, had notes and everything, but I forgot about it until today. 

I know CNN were coving it, yet I can't find a full video. If someone could tell me where to find the full thing (don't need a link) that would be great. 

Edit: I thought it the debate was September 13. Please forgive my stupidity. Can the mods delete this.
