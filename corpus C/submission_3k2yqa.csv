3k2yqa,"Has anyone tried a minimum wage law where minimum wages are proportional to the size of the business? For example, small businesses could pay their employees less, but large businesses like McDonalds or Starbucks would have to pay their workers living wages? Could a law like this realistically work?",249,Sgt_Pepper42,"Sorry if this a stupid question, I don't know much about economics and I realize that in this scenario, small business owners might actually be hurt because of people being less likely to work there because of the higher wages. Basically, would the benefits outweigh the problems?

Edit: What about a minimum wage proportional to the cost of living in the county/county equivalent where the work takes place? Has anyone tried that, and could that work?",108,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3k2yqa/has_anyone_tried_a_minimum_wage_law_where_minimum/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441711582,1444731630
