The reaction to Obama's agenda in 2010 was similar to the Republican revolution in 1994.  Obama, instead of adjusting to what the electorate told him, dug in his heels and doubled down.  The result has been basically ineffectual leadership from 2011 on, getting little accomplished legislatively and having to rely on executive orders and hoping the Supreme Court backs him up.  There's also the issue of how comparatively little Obama was able to get done with functionally complete Democratic control of the legislature in his first two years.

This assumes that Obama has ever actually tried to be bipartisan.  He started nearly from day one with ""I won"" and continued along those lines throughout.  I know the left likes to think the stimulus and Obamacare were capitulations to Republican ideas, but the history just doesn't support it.

A subset of Republicans thought Obama wasn't from here.

A large portion of Republicans thought Clinton was actively murdering people (Vincent Foster).

Kind of different.
