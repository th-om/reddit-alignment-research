cvc03l5,1,t3_3m4vlx,AHSfav,Yes. I would like to see carried interest taxed as income as well as cap gains rates raised (but not necessarily to income tax levels),4,0,1443053317,1444724830

cvc57rt,0,t1_cvc06s5,GZeus24,"Why not just place a lifetime cap on capital gains like other countries do?  Put a $1M cap on total claims under capital gains.  

This is more than enough for most regular people (house sales, stock holdings, just plain good fortune) to reap the benefits that are intended from the exemption without allowing for a lifetime of low taxes just because of your job like Romney.  Throw in carried interest while you are at it.",3,0,1443062107,1444724830

cvc7hww,0,t1_cvc65p9,GZeus24,"A legitimate scenario (deferred income/reinvestment by choice) that does create a problem....however, its a bit of a unicorn / joe the plumber scenario.  Could it happen?  Sure.  Maybe to one person every 10 years but its more of a pipe dream than reality based argument.  

However, it is a very poor rational to justify the current system where thousands of people are paying incredibly low tax rates on incredibly high incomes simply because they had enough money in the first place to buy a law that declares their income as 'special'.

None the less, how about an exemption for single proprietorships held more than 10 years?  Add an exemption for single homes owned more that 10 years as well and you can avoid catching people who bought the family home in an up and coming area.  Fair exemptions are easy to add as long as they target average people.  

Could exemptions like this solve your objection(s) or is it more a philosophical objection?

Edit: On second thought, ,maybe its easier to just change what is a cap gain as proposed by the OP rather than create a cap.",2,0,1443066291,1444724834

cvce6vi,0,t1_cvc8es7,GZeus24,"It is not that common.  How many people do you think this applies to on an annual basis in the US?

You are correct in one part in that I was conflating the buying of special treatment for carried interest with capital gains treatment - not the same at all.  Can I assume from your comment that you are in favor of eliminating the carried interest exception?

I also note that 15% is higher than the rate for the majority of taxpayers because the majority do not make the money - income distribution is out of kilter.  The 'majority' is a disingenuous comparison point.  Getting taxed at 13% on 50k is not comparable to getting taxed at 15% on millions in annual income.

For understanding your POV, do you believe that all taxation is theft of property?",2,0,1443087918,1444724834
cvc63xo,1,t3_3m4vlx,Risk_Neutral,"The problem sometimes the capital gains tax is that it will essentially triple tax dividends. First there is the corporate tax. Then there is the tax people pay on their income before they can make an investment. Then there is the capital gains tax. Carried interest should be taxed as income,  sure. All capital gains should. Could be offset by lowering the corporate tax to repatriate some money and stop people from bitching about the ""loopholes"". ",2,0,1443063670,1444724834
cvcz5ja,0,t1_cvc63xo,ellipses1,All money is taxed multiple times. There is no good reason dividends and capital gains shouldn't be treated as ordinary income,1,0,1443126546,1444724834

That's an idea I could potentially get behind - I'd have to see an outline of how the numbers would play out of course.  Do you think this would dis-incentivize institutional investment capital for businesses if they knew it would be taxed at a higher rate? Or would that be offset too?",1,0,1443097585,1444724834
cvckuf3,1,t3_3m4vlx,tuna_HP,"Of course. Its completely ridiculous. For investment fund employees, investing peoples' money is their day-to-day job.

cvcqwei,1,t3_3m4vlx,dl__,"Yes. All income should be taxed as income. It's income. It's fine to allow for exemptions to encourage certain behaviors but I believe taxes should be apportioned according to ability to pay.

cvc6vmp,1,t3_3m4vlx,guccimane12345,"No because I see income that fluctuates with performance as different than a salary or a wage and it is important that performance is not disincentivized. What most people don't want to admit is that an employee carries literally no financial risk in a business. When people see large figures that the system rewards to successful risk taking, they incorrectly see it as unfair because the failures are nowhere near as visible as the successes.

For investment fund employees, managing money is their day-to-day job. That is what they do for their income. No different from a pizza maker. Or if you insist on comparing against someone who makes money based on performance, a taxi driver who makes money based on how many people they can move however quickly. To pretend that their income is somehow fundamentally different from that of a taxi driver is arbitrary.

There is no logical economic reason for the carried interest loophole. It exists only because its been protected by politicians eager for investment funder donations.",3,0,1443105426,1444724834
