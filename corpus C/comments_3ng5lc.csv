If we had an honest discussion about the cost of care and services that wouldn't be necessary. 

Instead we get bullshit cop outs like 26 year old adult children being ""allowed"" to stay on their parents rapidly cost increasing healthplans and cheap birth control. 

Democrats argue for coverage. Republicans argue that somebody has to pay. 

Both purposely avoid a discussion on the cost of care, service and drugs. In some laws it's explicitly forbidden to negotiate the cost. 

It's a handout to the industry pure and simple. 

>No coverage caps

After significantly higher premiums for many people and pushing copays to more expensive coinsurance. 

>Insurance companies have to spend 80% on medical care

And Forest Gump never made a profit. 

How is that possible?!? Accounting wizardry. 

Profits have never been higher in the Healthcare and pharma industries. 

>Community health centers

How many are due to ACA and how many are simply due to the gold rush in Healthcare services today? It's extremely profitable to be in this industry. 

It's not the banks in my area building the huge campuses and lavish ambiance, it's the hospitals, pharma companies and insurance carriers. 


>Individuals and small businesses getting tax credits

I got $84 back on a $6000/plan that was 20% more than the previous year and pushed a lot of things from copay to coinsurance. 

Can you tell how happy that mice nuts token rebate makes me? 

>Medicaid expanded (except in obstinate Republican states)

At increased cost. 

>Medicare donut hole closed

Cost savings not as high as projected while federal subsidy line item is higher than expected meaning we added ~$100+ billion to budgetary costs instead of the reduction in cost sold to us. 

The subsidy from the federal government was supposed to be balanced by savings in Medicare. The opposite has happened. 

Oh yeah, the federal government has been at $18.4T since March when we hit the debt ceiling limit and started issuing IOUs to the social security trust and intergovernmental accounts for day to day funding since they're required to hold treasury assets as part of their mandate. 

So we are hitting these debt ceilings faster and faster. ACA increased pressure on the budget instead of relieving it and regardless of the pet issue headline debates over planned parenthood or the issue du jour Democrats think we need to just rubber stamp the next debt ceiling which will be $20T+.

I'm not a Republican but if you distill it back to ""who is going to pay for that coverage""? They're not wrong. We are contributing more of our individual and  national income to Healthcare without the much touted savings on a net net basis. Yeah I got $84 back, but the industry made tens of billions in profits.

10s of millions of people can now have coverage? Wtf does that even mean? They could before. Only people with preexisting conditions are better enabled to have more affordable coverage. That number is well under a million, perhaps closer to 100k.

No coverage caps replaced by rapidly increasing premiums, larger deductibles and coinsurance replacing copays. Unless you have a six figure procedure chances are you're spending quite a bit more for fewer service. 

Companies having to spend 80% on care is obviously bullshit as evidenced by the fact that the entire industry plus pharma has never had higher profits. Accounting wizardry, loopholes and consolidation have practically ensured that. 

The Medicare ""donut hole"" is irrelevant to the fact that costs associated with Medicare have increased, not decreased as projected and sold by ACA proponents.

Instead of ACA coming in at projected numbers, it's higher than expected. Pretty much the exact opposite of progress in that category.

No, it doesn't -- the American people provide the funding, at every step of the way.  The government distorts the entire market.  Medicare and Medicaid *underpay* providers to the tune of tens of billions each year ([source](http://www.aha.org/research/policy/finfactsheets.shtml)).  Medicare forces the young and relatively low-income (due to the more competitive global economy) to subsidize the old and relatively wealthy (due to the relatively America-centric economies in which they lived their working lives).  5% of the healthcare userbase incurs 50% of the cost, and the government, egged on by voters, attempts to fix what is ultimately a matter of scarce resources being inadequate to meet demand, continues to believe that by throwing money and regulation at the problem, it will go away.

>...and have still failed to introduce any way to actually encourage competition in service delivery. 

Government policies are *destroying* competition.  States typically issue ""certificates of need,"" authorizing new hospital construction *only after* its advocates somehow ""demonstrate that the community has demand for medical service"" (Read:  ""Never mind those healthcare costs ballooning at faster than the rate of inflation, I need to see my campaign coffers get fatter before I issue *Joe Schmoe* his certificate of need to build a new hospital"").  Congress maintains it's buddy-buddy relationship with the American Medical Association, which keeps doctors in artificially short supply (a tendency which, coincidentally I'm sure, keeps doctor wages high).  Professional licensing runs the gamut across the healthcare career field, raising the barrier to entry of *virtually everyone involved* (because, of course, the stupid/evil people could *never* figure out which radiologists, CNA's, LPN's, RN's, NP's, GP's, surgeons, and specialists are ""good"" versus ""quacks who are terrible at their jobs,"" -- never mind that they have solved this problem long ago for *everything else that they buy*).

I could go on, but everything about our healthcare system is wrong from the get-go -- and in that instance, it is irresponsible and naive to look at private companies and excoriate them for ""trying to earn a profit.""  They can't just buck the trend of rising healthcare prices ""to not be dicks,"" because that isn't what's causing rising healthcare prices.  Every player at every level of this game faces rising healthcare prices, and it's because of the perverse incentives set by the government.  You can't put a plant in soil and expect it to play nice with the other plants, when *you're* cutting off the other plants from having other avenues of nourishment and growth.

Well, that's the government.  It sets the game.  Private individuals and private companies *play that game*.

cvnuocn,0,t1_cvntif8,passionlessDrone,"> Cancer survival rates

OK.  I'll bite.  Are cancer survival rates better in America?  I'd love to see some data on this.  (?)  For example, I'm partial to [this analysis](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/cancer-care-in-the-u-s-versus-europe/) of cancer survival rates between the US and Europe that shows that the 'gain' of the US system is a function of lead time bias in the US; essentially 'diagnosis' of early stage tumors that may or *may not* have eventually turned into something that was going to kill you; i.e., 

> In other words, aggressive screening can lead to more patients having a diagnosis of cancer for a longer period of time even without any real improvement in survival.

> What all this means is that looking at population-level survival rates as a surrogate for how well a country is doing against cancer is fraught with confounders, in particular lead time bias. In a country where there is a lot of screening for cancer, lead time bias will be a bigger issue. There will also be more overdiagnosis, which will inflate the apparent survival time after a cancer diagnosis in the population. In such a case, we would anticipate that some of the largest gains in apparent survival would be in cancers for which major screening programs were undertaken, cancers like breast and prostate cancer, which is exactly what the authors observed. Now consider the time period that the authors chose to examine: 1983 to 1999. That is exactly the time period when large screening programs for breast and prostate cancer were being implemented, both in the U.S. and Europe. For example, in the U.S., breast cancer screening has traditionally been much more aggressive: Every year instead of every two to three years, as is common in many European countries and Canada, and beginning at age 40 rather than age 50, which is why these two graphs from the paper are not at all surprising.

>  This latter “exhibit” suggests that the vast majority of the detected survival advantage in the U.S. was due mainly to breast and prostate cancer, exactly the two cancers for which screening programs were ramped up beginning in the late 1970s through the 1980s.

Analysis of death from cancer reveals a mixed bag; essentially it depends on which type of cancer you have:

> I can’t help but notice, too, that if you really want to compare countries with universal health care systems to the U.S. (and, let’s face it, that’s what this is really all about, trying to show that “socialized medicine” leads to “death panels,” health care rationing, and lower survival rates for deadly diseases like cancer), you really should include Japan in the mix. The problem, of course, is that Japan does a lot better than the U.S. in many areas. My point, however, is not to denigrate the U.S. healthcare system. It does quite well in some areas, not so well in others, and overall it’s very good but not spectacular, at least when we look at cancer mortality. The real problem is not that the U.S. system doesn’t deliver quality cancer care. Rather, the problem is that delivering that care in the U.S. is spectacularly expensive for the results it gets compared to other countries that spend considerably less.

The idea behind it is access on demand, as opposed to access based (at least in theory) on ability to pay.  The idea is that people will be more likely to use medical services, thus finding out about diseases faster, but also resulting in exactly what you say: a lot of waste.

How do other nations deal with it?  Usually by rationing, due to service shortages.  This is why we spend more on preventative stuff and get more results in those areas, but also see an increase in prices as a result.
