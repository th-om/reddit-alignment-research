And what could California do with higher local taxes and lower federal taxes? Because that's what we're talking about, yes? First, sure it could cut back on carbon emissions within CA, but air pollution doesn't work that way.  And also, having a super clean train doesn't sound like a priority.

And as for the having each state run its own old age insurance program, I don't think competition is always the answer. For example, states currently compete against each other for jobs. They do this by lowering business taxes. When they do this, the tax burden is then shifted onto the individual taxpayers of the state.

There are programs which legitimately benefit from scale. One reason is that there cost savings from consolidation. Administering 50 separate social security programs is almost certainly going to require more government employees than administering one big one.  

Another reason is that some things only work if you get everybody to do it. If California eliminated its green house gas emissions, but nobody else cut theirs, then the whole thing would be a waste of time and money. ",3,0,1441762098,1444731410

Based on retirement date of 2011-11-07, and actual US income growth over past 40 years. Half of SS contribution is diverted to a private account and annuitized at retirement age. Annual administration cost of 0.25% is based on previous Social Security Administration scoring of private account proposals, with 6% annuitization cost at retirement.

Social Security is a net loss for most people once opportunity cost is figured, as it doesn't actually invest in anything, other than minimal yield guaranteed government debt.

A bit, but not a huge bit. Traditional index funds are already crazy cheap - I pay less than a quarter percent per year - because they're mostly automated, standardized, and sold by everyone.

cuv3yen,1,t3_3k66of,R_B_Kazenzakis,"They prefer that local taxdollars are controlled locally.  For example, a few ""last minute budget agreements"" back Congress removed D.C.'s ability to fund Planned Parenthood and similar programs even using their own collected taxdollars.  Dems lost their mind over it.

There's a big difference between control of *local* tax dollars and *Federal* ones.  A left-leaning Californian politician isn't trying to say ""the state of Alabama should be using their state-collected taxes in this manner""(or at least isn't really able to do anything about it since Federalism is a Thing) but the politician is saying ""You're getting *x* amount of Federal dollars, you should spend it this way"".  Even entitlement programs like Medicare/Medicaid where the state kicks in cash is mostly funded with Federal dollars.

But Alabama and California is a silly argument to make anyway, as AL takes in more in Federal monies that it gives in taxes, and CA takes in less than what it gives in taxes.  So, in a sense, the Californian really is looking out for ""his"" money in the scenario you presented.

>Why would someone in California care more abut a child in Alabama than a child in El Salvador?

Because humans are tribal creatures, and ultimately someone in Alabama is more often considered part of the family than someone in El Salvador.  This is ignoring that the economy, society, and culture of California is far, far more intertwined with with any American state before a foreign country.

It's easier to blame others rather than yourself.  *That even might be a little true in some cases*, but Alabama is a really crappy example of that.  Like it or not, Blue states tend to give more in Federal taxes than Red states, and Red states tend to take in more than they give.
