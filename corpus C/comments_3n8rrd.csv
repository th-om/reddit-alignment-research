What could have happened if we had gotten real campaign finance reform in 2009? Maybe obama would have been able to implement single payer, rather than having to get a plan the insurance companies could get behind. 

Who knows what kind of opposition bernie will face but if Obama's terms are any indication they're going to fight him tooth and nail on everything, because everything he wants to do is counter to the goals of the wealthy donors.

But I agree that Obama should have made campaign finance his first objective and put his political capital into that. From what I've heard Bernie say about Obama it's quite clear that he understands the mistakes Obama made and I think Bernie was one of the few who originally recognized that Obama made a mistake. I think a lot of people write Bernie off as an idealist mainly because of his truthfulness, but to be honest I think he's shown quite a bit of realism. He repeatedly says he needs to use a movement to give him enough strength to get the things we wants done. I think he's actually more pragmatic than Obama. I think the main reason people write him off as out of touch with reality is because we just aren't used to honest politicians. So when we get one, we think there must be something wrong with them.

In a 1996 survey, public finance economists were asked to estimate what percentage of the corporate income tax in the United States was ultimately borne by owners of capital. While their answers varied, the average response was 41 percent, meaning that the professional consensus is that more than half the burden is eventually shifted from owners of capital to workers or other groups.

>taking less is the same as giving something

tax cuts lead to reduced revenue for the govt and more money in pocket of the tax payer who the tax cut applied to. Seriously not tough to understand how these two things are comparable.

There is the question of moderate democrats but I don't see many people in the more conservative wing of the Democrats leaving Hilary in the first place.

Overall I think you lay out a very plausible scenario for how things might play out. I might just overreact a bit when people compare Trump to Sanders too closely. Trump is running on personality and emotion and is pretty divisive within his own party. Sanders has his own cult of personality and knows how to charge up his base but he's also a career politician who knows when to play the game in ways that Trump can't or won't. 

If Sanders sees a crazy bump after the first debate where people flip very emotionally I could see him losing it but by now Hilary is such a known factor that leaving her side is a huge shift to make as a Democrat.
