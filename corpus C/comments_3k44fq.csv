cuuqye7,0,t1_cuunlx0,Eroticawriter4,"Most polls have a margin of error of around 5%, which means 1 in 20 are wrong. When you look at smaller subsamples of each poll, you have another opportunity for the poll to be outside the margin of error (i.e. wrong) and since subsamples are always smaller than samples, the margin of error increases.

What you are talking about is the fact that most of these polls use 95% confidence intervals meaning there's an additional 5% chance the true number lies outside of the initial margin of error of plus or minus 5%.  So if a candidate polls at 30%, there is a 95% likelihood their actual support is between 25% and 35%.  5% of the time they actually have either less than 25% or over 35%.",5,0,1441743285,1444731478

Biden, despite his flaws, is arguably better suited for the general election than he is the primary.  That's the problem.  He doesn't have the appeal to the base that Sanders and Clinton do, but in the general election he has some very broad appeal and likability that would give him an edge.  The Republicans have people like that, too.  Jeb Bush is a good example.  He actually has a strong appeal to moderates and even among some minorities.

cuvjhoe,1,t3_3k44fq,HeyZeusCreaseToast,"Yes, Biden does pose a threat to Hillary Clinton, but actually would be a boon for the Bernie campaign, and would probably not be in Biden's best interests regardless.

As of right now, the Democratic Primary electorate can be boiled down into four sections (in reality it's more complicated than that, but for the sake of ease): Anti-establishment/Progressives (Bernie), Establishment (Hillary), Anyone-But-Establishment (Anyone-But-Hillary), Undecideds. Let's say the voting blocs breaks down to: 50% Establishment, 30% Progressive, 10% Anyone-But, and 10% Undecided. Bernie has a lock on the anti-establishment/Progressives vote, and, for the most part, the anyone but Hillary vote. Now those two Democratic sections are smaller in size than the Establishment vote, which is why Hillary doesn't view Bernie as a threat, or at least why she remains ahead in the polls. So at this point it looks like Hillary has 50% of the vote, Bernie has 40% of the vote, and 10% remain undecided. If Biden were to enter the race, since he would be viewed as another Establishment candidate, he has the potential to split Hillary's base of supporters, thus giving Bernie a leg up: Bernie 40%, Hillary 25%, Biden 25%, Undecided 10%.

All that being said, since this is a national poll, has little bearing on the actual election, as the *nation* as a whole doesn't elect the candidates, the individual *states* do. You would need to look at a breakdown of each of the states to see which candidates actually are in the lead.",1,0,1441804710,1444731482
