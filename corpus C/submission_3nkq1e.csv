3nkq1e,Compromise in the Face of Extremist Politics,27,FranceisBakin,"I frequent both r/politics and r/conservative in order to get a better idea of both sides of the political discussion. I noticed that, when discussing gun control, left-leaning redditors were willing to propose changes to the seconds amendment or analyze the language in a way that would make broad gun control legislation far more viable. Right-leaning redditors saw this as an attack on their constitutional rights. In contrast, and in a morbid display of mutual hypocrisy, when discussing the problem of automatic birthright citizenship, right-leaning redditors were willing to propose amendments to the 13th amendment or they were willing to analyze the wording in a different way so that birthright citizenship would not apply to illegal immigrants. Hypocrisy his not anything new to politics but what seems to be missing is the spirit of compromise. In light of these arguments to does it make sense to bundle these two arguments together in order for both sides to get something they want. That is: Would it be possible to pass legislation that passed broad gateways to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country in exchange for loosening restrictions on guns making gun ownership and concealed carry more ubiquitous across the country...Vice versa, would it be possible to end automatic birthright citizenship in exchange for wider federal gun restrictions. 


This idea of compromise, which is so missing from American politics, has led to an era of extremism. Why wasn't a carbon tax initiative placed with tax cuts for companies that accepted it? Why wasn't the estate tax eliminated in exchange for a higher tax rate on the highest earners?
