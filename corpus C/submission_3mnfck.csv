3mnfck,What's your favorite political TV show/Radio show/Youtube show/podcast/whatever that's from the opposite side of the political spectrum from you?,26,Gintoh,"I'm a right wing Libertarian but I watch left wing shows more often than right wing shows for some reason. I think Cenk Uygar on the Young Turks is a sensible liberal. 

Even though they are liberal they seem to weigh both sides of the argument pretty well like in the debate over political correctness. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqAG7VwQ7Og

Also I enjoy Sam Seder a lot. He always seems to be able to annihilate libertarians and conservatives in debates which causes me to reflect on my beliefs a lot.
