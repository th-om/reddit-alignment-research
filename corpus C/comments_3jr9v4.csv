Yeah, obviously beating the Great Depression and winning WW2 outweigh environmental concerns, which we knew little about back then anyway.

Yep. Do you understand how history works? You might as well criticize George Washington for not implementing ""Don't Ask Don't Tell.""


FDR was certainly among the most liberal/progressive Presidents, *considering the era he was in.* Obviously, as time goes on, the liberals' policies in particular start *progressing.* So obviously someone who's missed out on all the progress of the past 70 years is not going to be a great fit by today's standards of a liberal. 

Actually, they wouldn't even meet today's standards of a conservative. That's because the liberals are continuously dragging the conservatives (with their platform of tradition) into the modern age.

In the decades before the 60's politics was shaped around labor/workers versus capital/owners. FDR and the Democrats were on the labor side.
