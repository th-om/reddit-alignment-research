3l953h,"The phrase ""Illegal's will do jobs that American's won't."" Is driving me crazy....",17,warrenfgerald,"Has anyone ever seen the movie Sunshine Cleaning? It's a movie about a couple of women who begin a dead body cleanup operation. They cleaned up bio-hazard sites covered in blood, feces, urine, puke, and every other nasty liquid you can imagine. This got me thinking...  has to be the worst job ever created yet I don't see illegal immigrants showing up at these locations with hazmat suits ready to put in a day's work. With that being said, I think American's will do any job as long as the price is right. Why don't politicians & pundits ever add in that price/wage caveat when they talk about what American's won't do?
