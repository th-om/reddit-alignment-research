3mnjt3,Why should I not like Trump?,131,themooster32,"I am a undecided. But I do know I do not want to vote for Hillary and I have problems with Bernie, so that leaves the Republican side. Ben Carson is an idiot, Rubio is bat shit and that leaves Trump. As a Latino, I find his Immigration plan repulsive, but I know it can not happen. I have felt that Trump was very interesting and has some interesting plans. I watch 60 minutes today, and many things Trump said had me thinking. If he can get them through the house and senate, they could be interesting. So, why should I be anti-Trump?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mnjt3/why_should_i_not_like_trump/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443409324,1444723075
