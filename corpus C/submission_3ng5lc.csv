3ng5lc,Redditors who oppose Obamacare or similar plans: Do you have any thoughts on why other industrialized countries that are democracies/republics have failed to adopt a for profit model?,218,passionlessDrone,"I won't pretend to understand all of the subtleties of systems in place in Iceland, Tawaiin, Isreal, Germany, or Japan.

What I can determine from a brief skim is the following:

[Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_coverage_by_country#Iceland)

> Iceland has a universal public health system paid largely from taxation with local municipalities delivering health care services in the same way as other Scandinavian countries. Iceland's entire population has equal access to health care services  

[Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_coverage_by_country#Taiwan): 

> The current health care system in Taiwan, known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.[45] NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers.

[Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_coverage_by_country#Israel)

> Israel has a system of universal healthcare as set out by the 1995 National Health Insurance Law. The state is responsible for providing health services to all residents of the country, who can register with one of the four national health service funds. To be eligible, a citizen must pay a health insurance tax. Coverage includes medical diagnosis and treatment, preventive medicine, hospitalization (general, maternity, psychiatric and chronic), surgery and transplants, preventive dental care for children, first aid and transportation to a hospital or clinic, medical services at the workplace, treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism, medical equipment and appliances, obstetrics and fertility treatment, medication, treatment of chronic diseases and paramedical services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.[37]

[Germany:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_coverage_by_country#Germany) 

> Germany has the world's oldest national social health insurance system,[65][66][67] with origins dating back to Otto von Bismarck's Sickness Insurance Law of 1883.[68][69] The system is decentralized with private practice physicians providing ambulatory care, and independent, mostly non-profit hospitals providing the majority of inpatient care. Approximately 92% of the population is covered by a 'Statutory Health Insurance' plan, which provides a standardized level of coverage through any one of approximately 1100 public or private sickness funds. Standard insurance is funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies on a scale determined by income level. Higher income workers sometimes choose to pay a tax and opt out of the standard plan, in favor of 'private' insurance. The latter's premiums are not linked to income level but instead to health status.[70]

[Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system_in_Japan)

> The health care system in Japan provides healthcare services, including screening examinations, prenatal care and infectious disease control, with the patient accepting responsibility for 30% of these costs while the government pays the remaining 70%. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health care insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance programme administered by local governments. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice and cannot be denied coverage. Hospitals, by law, must be run as non-profit and be managed by physicians. For-profit corporations are not allowed to own or operate hospitals. Clinics must be owned and operated by physicians.

If I felt like copying/pasting until dinner time, I could have, of course, including pretty much all of Europe, another seven countries in Asia, Australia, you get the point.  While there are differences in these plans, some offering add on insurance, some a hybrid public / private model, some have no penalties for non-compliance, X,Y,Z they all bear a common theme of an attempt at (near) universal compliance with a centralized regulatory agency.  There is some degree of shared cost and shared benefit.    

Forgetting about the problems of trying to figure out if a two year lifespan increase in Japan is meaningful considering how many fat asses we have in America or whatever statistical nugget supports a viewpoint, what strikes me is that *none of these countries have elected representatives to move to the for profit model*.  We have a ton of examples to choose from, pretty much the entire industrialized world, and not one of those populations has gone to the voting booth and said: 'Move us to the American build of healthcare'.  I doubt this is a coincidence.  

To me, this is the biggest strike against the nonstop lamentations of gloom and doom over moving toward centralized healthcare; it has *literally been tried everywhere else*, and given the option between the problems with a socialized build and a for-profit build, no one has made the choice to go to a for-profit build.  

I think we can (?) agree that at least some (all) of these countries are inhabited by more or less rational people who have been given many opportunities to vote in new representatives.  Given that, do redditors who oppose Obamacare or its more liberal cousins have any ideas why this might be the reality?
