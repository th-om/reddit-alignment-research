Why is that necessarily a bad thing? I recognize that Stewart had a liberal bent, but if you're looking at bad places for sole news sources, the Daily Show is significantly better for staying informed than, say, people who solely listen to Rush Limbaugh.

Now, part of that is Limbaugh being a complete hack, a comparison in which virtually *any* program which actively discusses current political events would have trouble looking good.

SNL is the reason people think she said ""I can see Russia from my house"" when what she was actually saying was that as Governor of Alaska, she gained foreign policy experience because you can actually see Russia from an Alaskan island (which is true) and she had a higher security clearance because of our defenses in Alaska.

Every time she speaks, she emits a confusing word salad of nonsense that barely qualifies as a sentence, if at all.

Here is an example from a speech she gave back in January:

>""Things must change for our government. Look at it. It isn’t too big to fail. It’s too big to succeed! It's too big to succeed, so we can afford no retreads or nothing will change with the same people and same policies that got us into the status quo. Another Latin word, status quo, and it stands for, ‘Man, the middle-class everyday Americans are really gettin’ taken for a ride.’ That's status quo, and GOP leaders, by the way, y'know the man can only ride ya when your back is bent. So strengthen it. Then the man can't ride ya, America won't be taken for a ride, because so much is at stake and we can't afford politicians playing games like nothing more is at stake than, oh, maybe just the next standing of theirs in the next election.""

It seemed like the crowd knew it was too strong of a response to ignore entirely, but they were clearly not on his side. The crowd was absolutely a Bush crowd, and just as that made it tough for Trump, with Kasich being the establishment alternative to Bush maybe the goal is to squash him before he can become a threat.
