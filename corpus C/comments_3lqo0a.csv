That is to say, ""If you have money and desire they will build it"" vs. ""If you build it they will come"".

How would businesses as a whole make more money if there is more equality?  If you've taken money from the rich and given it to the poor, what have you accomplished?

If its a school of thought in the field of economics, then by its very nature it is logical. You can produce products all you want, but if there is no demand/desire for those products, you're not going to sell much and thus will not do much to impact the economy. On the other hand, when products with high demand already exist, the difference between the companies responsible for those products making a profit and being able to pay their employees a decent wage is how many customers they have. Therefore, more customers with spending ability = more profits = more money in the hands of employees = higher spending and the cycle continues.

>Everything is a want, 'essentials' are just wants that have a broader range of prices you'd be willing to pay (for instance, if food was really really expensive you'd still buy it, but if toilet paper was really really expensive you might not)

I fundamentally disagree with this. Food, shelter, and hygiene are bare essentials, and without them the quality of life deteriorates in such a fashion that you'd actually have to spend *more* (think of going to the dermatologist because your non-toilet paper having ass just developed a nasty skin infection) to get by. 

>How would businesses as a whole make more money if there is more equality? 

By having a larger segment of the population they can realistically market to. There's a clear difference in profits if 40% of the population can afford your products as opposed to 20%.

>If you've taken money from the rich and given it to the poor, what have you accomplished? 

Well, I'm not a socialist, so I wouldn't encourage just taking money from people, regardless of how wealthy. I'd promote policies that would open more job opportunities. However, the logic from people like Sanders is if you raise taxes on the rich you've increased the amount of money that goes into entitlement programs and the safety net that's there for the lowest rung of society.

Stop throwing 'logic says' and 'logical' where it doesn't belong.  There are contradictory conclusions in economics based on what premises you hold to be true.  Economics is a mix of empirical science, social science, and mathematics.  The mathematics might be unambiguous, but the empirical conclusions or social models are anything but.

What are you trying to say?  I think you're trying to say that everything is an economy of scale?  That is not true.

For starters, there's a national movement to raise the minimum wage. So we can start there. Its not going to take long before someone raises the issue of stagnant wages and their detrimental effect on the middle and lower class. There's going to be big pressure on companies that are doing well to pay their employees a decent and proportional wage. 

> Ok... if you want you can make the arbitrary decision about what is essential to life.

Its far from arbitrary. I don't know a person who would argue that food, shelter, and basic hygiene products are essential for human life, given that you can loose your life or your quality of life can *significantly* decrease without access to those essentials.

>Like allowing successful businesses and good investors to grow faster (i.e. taxing less)?

More like removing unnecessary regulations.

>You could also raise taxes on everyone equally and accomplish the same thing. There's no fundamental reason why taxing the rich is better than taxing the poor.

There are two fundamental differences. One is that you get more money when you tax the rich. The other is that a poor person has more to lose than a rich person when being taxed. Taking a couple thousand from a millionaire or billionaire is nothing. Taking the same amount from someone in the middle and upper classes can be disastrous to them.

Greenspan, as chairman of the Federal Reserve, was at this time aware of criminal fraud.  As far as which individuals he knew were involved, I guess we have to ask him.
