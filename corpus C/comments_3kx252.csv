cv19wrd,0,t1_cv18yqt,Shiloh86,"I can think of a few off the top of my head. School voucher programs are essentially where students go to a private school but the tuition is paid for partially/entirely by the government. It's a good way to get disadvantaged/inner-city students into a good learning environment- but private schools don't need to hire unionized teachers, so such a system would weaken the position of any teacher's unions.

Another one I can think of is charter schools, which are private schools that receive public funding. If a charter school isn't doing well enough, its charter can be revoked, which makes such schools much more accountable for how well they do. Again, charter schools, because they're private, would hurt teacher's unions because they don't need to hire unionized teachers.",8,0,1442248090,1444729022

Assuming they can actually GET to the school they're now going to attend.  And if they can, they kids who can't get out of their ""bad"" school will have even fewer resources to be educated with.

cv1a93k,0,t1_cv19wrd,WhiteyDude,"I don't see how that's good for our education system though.  Diverting public funds to private institutions only helps the private institutions and those who go there.  It hurts the public institutions, only making the situation worse. And being able to hire teachers for less money might save money in the short term, but will only make teaching even less attractive to future graduates who might have considered it, so you can expect the quality of teachers entering the field to go down.

cv1cykp,0,t1_cv1a93k,Ben_Afflock,"Typically the argument for vouchers and school choice hinge on the public school being inadequate, and many of them are. This raises a very personal issue because some people simply can't afford the good school they want and the politics and situation of the failing school isn't likely to change.

The parent in that situation would obviously like a choice in what school their child attends and don't feel they should be paying into pubilc schools they aren't having children attend.

In many places both rural and urban the public schools are just shockingly bad places for children to be. It isn't the teachers fault, but the teachers unions fight tooth, claw, and nail to protect their turf even if it removes choice for the parents who really are between a rock and a hard place.

Many of the public schools out their are forced daycare with absurdly low standards of academic achievement and effort, little to no choice for students, and overall a depressing place to be.


I spent four years in high school not all that long ago and I'll never forget being a cog in a machine being talked AT for hours on end. It was exhausting and depressing. Harsh rules of conduct and the school itself was drab and depressing. It was a horrible experience and teacher's unions have marked it as their territory and the hill they are ready to die defending.

Charter schools for at least 2/3rd of children they end up worse off or no better then public schools.

cv17val,1,t3_3kx252,houinator,"Generally, any union for employees that work in a first responder capacity are bound by different rules than the rest (in the US).  Teachers frequently go on strike to push for higher wages, using disrupting the schooling of the children they are entrusted to educate as leverage to get what they want.

Imagine if you had a union of say, firefighters, try to do the same thing?  ""Oh, yeah, we'd love to put out that giant wildfire that's threatening to burn down the town, but the union voted to go on strike unless you double our pay first"".  People would be rightly outraged, and firefighters unions would rapidly be far more hated than teacher's unions.

Police unions have gained a lot of recent exposure from the increase in reporting of police misconduct, but again, the average person has less exposure to the police union than the teacher's union. 

Politicians, in either their duty to their district or in their own self interest will jump into a discussion in support or opposition. So as education plays a much bigger role in the electorate's lives, there's a bigger chance those in power will spend more time talking about it, and thus the powers (unions) in play.
