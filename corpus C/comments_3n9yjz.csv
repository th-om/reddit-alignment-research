Perfect is the enemy of good.  The NRA itself probably wrote as much of the assault weapons ban as anyone else, and the compromise the two sides of adults agreed on was limiting the access of americans to rifles that can fire rifle grenades, and rifles that have bayonet lugs, ***BECAUSE THAT IS THE COMPROMISE THAT CONSERVATIVES ACCEPTED***

That's how compromises work.

So now you have people unwilling to accept any gun control criticizing pro gun control people for not doing more because the pro gun control people couldn't do more.

You can argue ""but drug laws don't work"", but gun control does actually work.  Just like you can't argue that drug laws would work and point at japan, or the UK, or almost any other first world country you can't argue that gun control wouldn't work.  You're arguing against an established fact.

>We can probably agree that mental health is a serious issue that is not being seriously addressed in this country, so I wish they would start there. But they never do. They go straight for the guns as if this person would have gone home and slept it off had they not had access to a firearm.

The NRA has been trotting out the mental health red herring for 45-55 years.  During that time mental health care in the US has only gotten worse.

Let's say that tomorrow republicans come to the table willing to strike some kind of reasonable deal that would reverse half a century of continually worsening mental health care in the US and bring about modern, high quality, accessible mental health care?  That would be great, but it still wouldn't address the gun problem.

If the NRA doesn't like monthly mass shootings flooding the media maybe they should look into that.  But gun control still needs to be addressed.  You know.  After paying it lip service for 45-55 years.

Context is important. At no point in the history of these countries has the rate of firearm ownership been anywhere near as high as it currently is in America. With enough guns to arm all 300,000,000 plus people in the United States, assuming that we can apply the same gun control measures as other countries and solve the problem is ignoring the reality we face. This is not even taking into account the differences in geography, ethnic diversity, levels of poverty, and standards of education.

I won't repeat all the arguments here, but since you are repeatedly posting this as a source of information I highly urge you to read that thread (it's not that long) and draw your own conclusions about the validity of those stats. A good way to illustrate what is wrong is to sum the population and fatalities columns in the [archived full version](https://archive.is/f4gbv).

Edit: To illustrate my point properly I did the summing: The sum of all deaths in countries except the united states is: 182 for a population of 935 405 145. This is a ""rampage shooting rate"" of 0.19 per 1 million people. For the united states that rate is 0.72, which means the rate for the united states is 3.7 times higher than that of the other countries in the chart. Now yes: there are a few countries in the chart that have a higher rate, due to large shootings and a small population (notice that in the fourth column, they all have 1 or 2 shootings, as opposed to the united states 38).

The equivalent of doing this to the united states would be splitting the statistics for all states, which would result in some states that have had no shootings (since there are more states than shootings during that period of time), just like there are countries in Europe that have had no shootings in those five years, and some states that would have much higher rates than the average for the entire US.

To be clear: I'm not implying any conclusions about gun control from this, but the statistics that you have linked to are presented in a highly misleading way, masking the fact that the united states is highly out of the ordinary in that list. What the reason for that discrepancy is, is a much more complicated discussion, but the stats you linked to certainly don't provide an answer.

I really, really, really wish that I could come up with a better reason for disagreeing with you. 

I agree that some level of violence is inevitable, and that the trend of mass shootings is indicative of deeper problems in this country. I want to believe so badly that some piece of legislation could have kept guns out of the wrong hands. Even if it's only successful once, I'm happy to blur the lines of my 2nd amendment rights to save even one innocent life.

Other items on the pro-gun ""wish list"" that are ripe for a good-faith compromise are removing suppressors from the National Firearms Act (many countries in Europe treat suppressors as hearing safety equipment, and I'm told some places actually mandate their use when hunting) and re-opening the machine gun registry so that non-government folks can purchase machine guns manufactured after 1986 (some would like the entire registry scrapped, but just reopening it while maintaining the additional requirements would be more politically feasible I think).

Keep in mind that Elliot Rogers stabbed three people to death before he even started shooting. And while the Boston bombers only killed three people at the marathon finish line, there were also dozens of people who ended that day with fewer limbs than they woke up with. You can't say with any certainty that the shooter in OR wouldn't have harmed just as many people through any other method.

What I do not support is any type of legislation that would make it prohibitively difficult for a sane law abiding citizen to own firearms for recreation and self defense while having no effect on violent crime.

Yes, there are. And no, I can't say with certainty. But I can say it with a high degree of probability.

I'd invite anyone to compare the number of deaths by knife or bomb to the number of gun deaths in America. A gun is a tool to make killing easier. Lacking that tool, a certain percentage (probably a large percentage) of violent people wouldn't be able to act on their urges or intentions. Some few might make bombs. Some more might stab people. But right now any nutjob with the will to do it can get his hands on a machine designed to rapidly spit death, and kill three or ten or twelve or twenty people before anyone has time to react. The pasty internet troll can drop the trained combat veteran with seven rounds before the soldier can even reach him. What would that kid's chances have been if he had a knife? 

I can say this with certainty: without easy access to guns, there would be far fewer violent deaths in America, for the simple fact that violently killing someone would be far harder to do. ",2,0,1443895249,1444720258

Again, still not getting to the root of the issue as I've mentioned in other comments. If you put a mentally deranged person in a strait jacket and a padded room they'll no longer be a danger to themselves or others, but it still doesn't resolve the fact that they're mentally deranged.

I'm all for preventing these people from getting a gun legally, but it still concerns me that there are pasty internet trolls out there who would kill a dozen people and take their own life for no particular reason.

It also doesn't address the much larger source gun violence which is street crime. The streets are flooded with millions of illegal guns and criminals don't tend to abide by gun control regulations.

You have been misled.  This is the mantra *every time* they push for more regulation.  Have you ever bothered questioning why it is *you're* the one being asked to sacrifice your rights?

And what has their regulation accomplished?  Nearly a century of gun regulation has gone by, and gun deaths fluctuated up and down with no regard for the laws.  Suddenly, from 1986 onward, we experience a slew of states liberalizing their gun laws, and *even the Federal government* doing the same, to some extent (via the passage, and subsequent expiration of, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban), a growing population, and *a decline* in total AND per-capita gun-violence...

Seriously?

Your past self made the decision to personally obtain a firearm.  Why did you do that, if guns have no place in society?

>How? You yourself said that from 1986 gun laws have regulated? The entire slippery slope argument is predicated on assumption anyhow. Inferring future causality is not a great choice.

Apart from banning fully automatic weapons from being manufactured or sold to the general public (because, as you well know, *before* 1986, the general public was just *awash* with fully-automatic bloodshed), the 1986 law *expanded* gun rights.  The idea of ""open carry"" or ""concealed carry"" wasn't a thing before 1986, and if you're going to stake your claim on the effectiveness of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, well, good luck with that argument, since it regulated all 2% of gun crimes.

So no, I didn't say that from 1986 onward ""gun laws have regulated.""  They have *de*-regulated.  And, I will repeat, over that same period of relative deregulation, increased per-capita gun ownership AND increased population, violent crime committed with firearms has fallen.

There isn't a problem in need of correction.  There are people, with *their* ideal aesthetic of ""what society 'should' look like,"" and it doesn't have any guns in it.

Never said guns have no place in society. Again with the assumptions man, jesus. Being a ""liberal gun owner"", as I said, I'm not overly passionate about gun rights.

I would hope you can at least recognize that the statistical argument for/against the efficacy of gun control can work both ways. There's plenty of sources pointing out correlations between higher gun-control and lower crime.

The implication was that the ONLY way to address this problem is through a curtailment of gun rights.  Broadly, the data DOES NOT show that.

>Never said guns have no place in society.

>Again, jesus fucking christ man. Do you think anyone that isn't 10000% pro gun is completely against every gun in existence?

Nope, they definitely exist.  And they are unknowing pawns to the politicians and supporters that openly want nothing less than a total gun ban.  Every time you hear someone parrot that phrase, ""We are the only advanced country that deals with this,"" that is a person implying for a total gun ban, even if they don't realize it.

We will *always* be that country, as long as we continue to allow guns.  Logically, the only way for us to escape that criticism, is to ban them.

This is the unfortunate truth. The shooter obtained his guns legally. However many barriers you want to put in place, a true sociopath with nothing to lose will find a way to pass any checks or evaluations. By the time he's caught, he's already done the deed.

I don't know of anyone on the right/NRA/Gun owners who are against violent criminals or mentally ill people being barred from gun ownership.

IMO the 2nd amendment was included in the BOR as a warning to future generations of our government. As in, be forewarned that the populous is armed and if you mess with their liberties and get all tyrannical they just might lay a 'well regulated militia' on your ass.

I'm from Baltimore and during the riots there was a curfew for a week. Why? One reason was because the police were spread thin and couldn't respond to calls like they would/should have during normal times. I think we could all agree that this would be a good time to be able to have a firearm in order to protect your life and property. But what if you had (even though you had never been violent) deemed 'unfit' for gun ownership, should you then just be at the whim of criminals and not be able to defend yourself? These are difficult questions. These riots were for real, just six months ago, right here in my own city.

IMO the biggest problem is that this country LOVES VIOLENCE. We have since the beginning but it intensified and hasn't stopped since the Civil War. 1st - The outlaw wild west. Then Bonnie&Clyde, John Dillinger around the turn of the century. Then excessive government regulation in the form of Prohibition brought on THE FUCKING MAFIA. Then post WWII, the Hell Angels, Crips, Bloods. All of these people/gangs have/had been popularized by the media with books, music, especially movies and TV. Our whole current culture is awash in violence/crime. What are among the top shows on TV? Crime shows, have been for ages.

This is the beginning to a very slippery slope. Our government is starting to show that they can become rogue very easily (they're already breaking the Constitution with ZERO repercussion) and one of the first thing a rogue government is going to try and do is disarm the public to prevent rebellion.

If it weren't for easy access to guns, we would all be Brits right now. A common misconception people have about rogue governments is that it will happen overnight, that there will be some noticeable change and suddenly the government will be evil and it will be easy to spot.

It takes a long time to get people willing to go against the citizens best interest into positions of power. In the colonies, it was nearly 175 years between the first English settlement and the revolutionary war. Adjusting for life expectancy, that is a lot of generations of slow legislative movement that ended up allowing tyranny to take place. Just as it would be slow today. We may see the first few indications of a rogue government like the NSA today, but our great grandchildren could be forced to fight for their freedom the way our founding fathers did. The fathers knew that, they knew the average person would put their own feelings of safety before the liberty of their own children. That's why they wrote gun ownership as a core personal right.

Banning certain firearms because of cosmetic features. Have two guns, both fire the same round, same rate of fire, range, impact force, etc... One is perfectly acceptable and the other is a scary black assault rifle that needs to be banned.

Take the last two shootings where the president called for more gun laws (this shooting in Oregon and the shootings of the reporters in Virginia)

In the Virginia shooting, the murderer had purchased the gun legally and passed a background check. He purchased it a month before, so a wait period or class requirement would not have mattered as there was ample time to pass both (article doesn't specify if these were needed but we can agree it would not have changed anything). He used a hand gun and not some banable weapon (ar-15, automatic rifle, high capacity mag ect). 

http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/virginia-tv-shooting/vester-flanagan-bought-gun-legally-virginia-dealer-officials-say-n417136


Yesterday's shooter had all his weapons purchased from a federal dealer, though obviously details are still light since it happened only yesterday. But the purchases were either by him or his family members over 3 years (13 weapons in total). This mean he passed a federal background check, for whichever ones he purchased. Even if for some reason a law was made to prevent him from purchasing a gun, he could have used any of the other family members guns to do the same thing.

That said I agree with a few of the Libertarians in this post. Gun control is just treating the symptoms of larger societal problems. The people that execute these tragedies do so because they are either a bit unstable (Aurora Shooter and I too live in Colorado) or have a intense hatred for a certain group (yesterday and Charleston) and I believe they would do so even if they did not have access to guns. Aurora shooter rigged his apartment to blow and kill as many people as possible. Don't you think that he would just throw a couple homemade bombs in the theatre if he did not have access to guns? Shooters like the guy yesterday that reportedly was shooting Christians have even more drive to harm others so it makes sense that access to guns would not matter.

As for other shooting, like what happens everyday In Chicago, gun control would have little affect b/c most of the guns they use are illegal anyway.

To some degree I think this is true, there is a level of complacency in the Republican party, which IMO has a lot to do with the pandering to the religious right. I also want to be careful to note for others reading this that I am referring to Conservatives and not Libertarians. I realize they can have fundamentally different views on personal freedoms. 

I will admit that I think some of this complacency can be attributed to us on the left. Many of us continue to go back to this controversial stance of gun control and try to push the right into a corner every time a tragedy happens. If we were to focus our efforts in other areas perhaps the right would feel less persecuted and be more willing to work towards fixing the problems I mentioned above.

Who knows though, maybe it is just wishful thinking on my part.

I've been discussing gun violence as a whole this entire thread, not this individual mass shooting incident. The ""liberal"" example you presented is exactly the problem. Although it affects most of the population. We turn a blind eye to where the real violence is happening (inner-cities, poor communities, race-based) but go full 24/7 news coverage when it is a crazy white man with a gun killing other white men. I'm more concerned about the gang-violence--it's amazing 43 people can get shot in Chicago in one weekend just a few weeks ago and it doesn't even get a headline. Same with Baltimore. And D.C.--We have systemic issue of only giving shit when its a crazy white guy shooting other white people (when thats not the real issue)

Just because something is in the Constitution doesn't make it right. The Constitution used to condone slavery and legally require runaway slaves to be returned. However, the amendment process has become impossibly difficult. Nobody will ever be able to touch the 2nd amendment by further amending.

See above.

I'm sure you're perfectly aware that the Second Amendment was written during the era of muskets. Obviously, the world has changed in incalculable ways, including in the efficiency and deadliness of firearms.  This is not an appeal to emotion, it is simply true.  I don't understand how anti-gun control advocates can ignore this basic reality.  To say that anyone should be able to buy a gun without any sort of restriction, or else it infringes on a 200 year-old amendment written by men who couldn't have possibly foreseen the future of firearm technology, flies in the face of common sense.

10,000 people a year are not dying over the right to vote.  10,000 people a year are not dying over free speech.  And we have limits on free speech should it incite violence.  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions

Our rights are not absolute.  We have a precedence of placing limits on an individual's Constitutional rights for the safety of our citizens.

I don't think so. Orwellian typically refers to a society that is oppressed through fear. I think that my hypothetical qualifies as that.

In any case, you can pretty easily find statistics that show crime rates are also lower in areas with less guns. Having this debate predicated on circumstantial evidence on a broad scale is pretty unproductive.

The evidence is pretty one-sided here.  Most of gun control statistics are based around things like the prevalence of 'gun violence' or 'gun deaths', not crimes.  Gun violence conflates a many, many things (homicide and justified self-defense are both 'gun violence').  However, if we divide the states into two groups- the one's with the most guns and the one's with the fewest- the robbery rate drops %40 in states with guns.  The homicide rate remains identical across groups.

Gun violence conflates a many, many things (homicide and justified self-defense are both 'gun violence'). However, if we divide the states into two groups- the one's with the most guns and the one's with the fewest- the robbery rate drops %40 in states with guns. The homicide rate remains identical across groups.

Its the same position I have on privacy, warrantless wiretapping, LBGT rights, and anything else that the Federal government violates. I can't call myself a Libertarian and say that the Federal government has the right to pick and choose which parts of the US Constitution to follow without the consent of the US citizenry to amend the United States Constitution legally by way of Article V of the Constitution. For me the only way to infringe the current rights protected by the US Constitution is by way of Article V. The only exception to this is with the 50 states. I believe that the states have a right to regulate guns within the state boarders as long as it doesn't violate there respective state constitutions. 

Fear of something isn't a good enough reason to violate the US Constitution for me. Fear has justified a lot of wrongs in history and violations of rights. Fear of drugs have lead to the failed War on Drugs. Fear of alcohol lead to Prohibition. Fear of Japanese during WW2 lead to interment camps in the US. Fear of terrorism lead to the Patriot Act. Fear of Communism lead to the McCarthy era in the United States. Fear of the spread of Communism lead to wars in Korea and Vietnam. Fear of African-Americans lead to segregation and Jim Crow. 

As for gun control we see time and time again the failures of the system. Is more regulations really the answer to this? I don't think it is. Crime and suicide have been rising over the last few years. One of my biggest concerns of late have been the rise of suicide in the United States. In 2014 this nations suicide rate reached a level not seen since 1987. 2014 saw the third highest suicide rate this nation has seen since we started recording that statistic. Crime has been rising to an extent that it rivals the gang violence of the 1990's. I'm not just talking about gun violence either here. Almost every single category of crime has risen over the last few years. To me we have a overall crime issue facing us as a nation that is being overlooked due to politicization of the gun issue. Something is going wrong right now and no one seems to be watching these things. We need to address this as an overall problem not just taking a political position on one issue.

>Nobody is going to take our guns away, if that were the case, I would be with you.

Maybe not in this Administration, but freedoms you give up today you will never re-gain, and some freedoms given up can pave the way for other future Administrations to seriously overstep their bounds. (think registration)

I just like to shoot. I've been shooting over 40 years. As has my family and circle of friends. I hunt. I've shot in competitions. I handload. I love to take the kids to the range. I've taken many classes. I have a CCW. I buy, sell, and trade guns for the enjoyment. I'm a collector of some of these types of items. There are many many law abiding American's just like me. 

What we see is laws being passed that have absolutely zero effect on gun violence. Look at Clinton's ""Assault Weapon"" ban. That did nothing but cause the rifle to grow in popularity to the point that it became the most popular rifle in America. Before his ban you hardly ever saw military *looking* rifles at the range except those with wood stocks. 

Here is what I predict. Eventually ""universal"" background checks will pass. Essentially background checks on private sales. It won't have any affect on gun violence whatsoever because it will be largely ignored, because there is no way to enforce it without registration. That will be the argument for registration. 

If registration is allowed to happen, that will set the stage for banning certain types of weapons, and what will ensue is mandatory buy back programs, just like Australia. If Australia type gun laws are what you want in America, then by all means pursue them. I don't. 

What's changed in America? We've had guns since our inception. My Dad had guns his whole life. He could even take his shotgun to school to use after school or to show his shop teacher. I grew up in the 70's and there were just as many guns around then as now. We always had them in our house. No one ever talked about going and shooting up a school. It was unthinkable. 

Something has changed, and it's not the gun. I attribute it to the breakdown of the family values. Fatherless children. Gangs. Glorification of violence on TV. Video games. And social media. Now we are starting to see crimes enhanced by social media. Now we read about gun crimes everyday whereas in the past unless you got a newspaper or watched the evening news on TV you didn't hear about all this stuff. It causes copy cats. This most recent killer is even quoted as saying ""Seems the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight.” 

Implementing gun laws is a band aid. It's the easier thing to do, but it won't fix the sickness. That being said, I don't know what the answer is. 

Since I can't fix the problem, the only thing I can do for the time being is defend myself against it. I've taken self defense classes, and carry concealed. I stay away from certain areas of town, and avoid certain situations. I stay aware of my surroundings. If I am put in a situation like in that school (I would be carrying even though it's a gun free zone) I would die either shooting to defend myself or die trying to choke the crap out of that guy. I'm not going to just stand there and be shot in the face. I will defend myself and my family, and others, law or no law. That's called an inalienable right. ",2,0,1443890568,1444720350

I had to include a letter from my psychiatrist, confirming ""Yes, he suffers from depression, but I'm quite sure he's not homicidal or suicidal.""  And on top of all that, they ran a criminal record check on me.  If the answers from all of those things hadn't been tickety-boo, I wouldn't have gotten my licence.  And no licence means it would be illegal (and difficult through any legal channels) for me to acquire or possess any firearm or ammunition.

It's not perfect. Of course gang-bangers and other crooks get a hold of firearms illegally, often smuggled from Detroit or Seattle.  Of course people with clean records do stupid horrible things with their firearms sometimes.

But lots of us own firearms legally, we don't get much, if any, hassle from the police as long as we follow the rules, and outside of a few of the paranoid, we aren't worried about the government ""taking our guns.""

I attach that to the common meme of ""You have to take a course and pass tests to get a licence to operate a motor vehicle, and you have to register your motor vehicle(s) and have insurance for them.""  Firearms are at least as dangerous as motor vehicles, so why the hell should they not be subject to at least the same kind of rules as motor vehicles?

* I'm having trouble finding good solid accurate recent stats for the US that use raw numbers (everything I've found so far is rates and percentages), but of female victims of homicide, everything I've seen so far in my search says that 35-40% were killed by a current or former intimate partner.

Now, 56 females murdered by current or former intimate partners per year might not seem like a lot by American standards, but it's pretty big by Canadian standards.

Indeed.  Hell, in some ways, Canada's very **existence** is kind of as a counter-America.  After the aboriginal people and the early French settlers in what is now Quebec, the people who currently populate Canada are, or descended from:

* The people you Americans called ""Tories"" during and after the Revolutionary War, and who we called ""United Empire Loyalists"". Many of them were forced out of their homes and farms and property in the 13 Colonies, and many others left voluntarily. King George III and his government told them ""Go up to [what is now southern Ontario, and New Brunswick], and we'll give you free land!""  These were people, obviously, who had views on society and governance and laws which differed from those who supported the American Revolution.
* Immigrants who wanted to come to North America, but for one reason or another, preferred Canada over the US.  Now, for some, it was an issue of ""not having a choice""; when my wife's Swedish grandfather immigrated with his wife and kids, he was told that he was too old to be admitted into the US (he was just over 50, IIRC), but Canada said he was fine, come on over.  :)  But others who could have immigrated into either Canada or the US definitely chose Canada because they preferred our way of looking at things to the American way of looking at things.

A lot of it is what you grow up with, too.  If I'd been born in the US and grew up there, my views would probably differ accordingly.

> That being said, I say to those that disagree with American philosophies and political views, ""either shut up, work to change it, or move."" There are so many whiners these day's that do nothing but complain. 

Word. I ran for city council in my hometown twice and won once, I've served on district executives of my political party of choice, I regularly contact my political representatives on this or that issue, I vote every chance I get. Once I actually led a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of electoral districts in my home, and **won**, with the decision setting an important precedent that's used to this day to guide re-districting all over Canada.  So yeah, when I hear people bitching but then hear that they couldn't even bother to vote, I get kinda cranky.

It sure wasn't poor white people. Maybe prisoners, but you have an incredibly difficult argument to make that the original intention of the clause was not centrally targeted at slaves. Are you really trying to argue that there people to whom their  ""service or labour may be due"", were not slave owners?


Yes, the document never once used the word ""slave"", and never explicitly mentioned slavery. The framers were intentionally vague with stuff like this, and yes, it has proved useful in cases concerning prisoners, but that does not negate the historical origins of the language. 

However, it's obvious that through the fugitive slave clause and the Fugitive Slave Act which forged a mechanism to exercise that clause, that slavery was condoned.

They use Australia and the UK and Japan as models for their policy. So whenever they talk about ""sensible gun control,"" the end game is something much more onerous. If we wait until someone proposes some oppressive regulation scheme to oppose the gun control agenda, it will already be too late. Give the gun controllers an inch and they'll take your guns though.

Also the gun debate is how it is for two reasons:

First, guns are a very primal issue. Gun rights supporters see guns as something that can keep them alive in a desperate situation. Taking away guns, or suggesting policy that will lead to the restriction and eventual potentially taking of guns, is an existential threat. Gun control advocates are asking these people to let themselves be killed. Personally, I don't intend to be killed because of someone else's naive idealism. Meanwhile, many people want restrictions because they don't know anything about guns other than how dangerous they are and that guns can kill people. To them, the continued presence of guns in society -- particularly outside the hands of their trusted authority figures -- means more chances for them to get killed. They fear these dangerous things that they don't understand, and they would rather ban them than overcome that fear and make an effort to understand.

Second, the gunphobes are desperate. They couldn't get anything passed by exploiting Sandy Hook, which in their eyes should have been America's Port Arthur. There will never be such a golden opportunity for them again, and they failed despite mobilizing everything they had to push through every regulation they currently want.

cvmyl36,0,t1_cvmpjsh,HomelessPandas,">Give the gun controllers an inch and they'll take your guns though.

I understand there are politicians that have said this. But why are you so convinced that this is a threat? If a bi-partisan coalition of politicians came out and promulgated an agenda of moderate regulation(whatever that is) would you ever be willing to take that seriously?

>Gun control advocates are asking these people to let themselves be killed.

See I'm confused here, you are portraying the pro-regulation crowd as being this united front that essentially wants to break down your door and steal the guns you own.

cvn50t0,0,t1_cvmyl36,Vayate,">I understand there are politicians that have said this. But why are you so convinced that this is a threat?

That's precisely why it's a threat. Democrats will have full control of government one day, just as Republicans once did. Gun control is back at the top of their agenda after Sandy Hook. When that happens, it's going to be the 90's all over again.

I'd be willing to accept some moderate and meaningful regulations *if and only if* some of the old and failed regulations are repealed in such a way that lawful gun owners come out with a lower regulatory burden. Lawful gun owners have to get something out of the deal. Historically, gun control advocates' idea of compromise has meant that they don't implement all of their regulations at once, and that's not acceptable. If we give them a win, it's only going to embolden them. Politically, in the interest of retaining gun rights in the future, it's necessary for the crusaders to become and remain demoralized until they fade into irrelevance. Right now they're desperate, and just a few blows away from demoralization. If further demoralizing them means taking a minor setback, I'm okay with it.

>Those are your words. That's not what they're asking.

If they're taking away a life-saving device, which is what guns are to many people, then yes, that's what they're asking. They're asking me to put myself in a position where someone else may threaten or take my life and I will be powerless to stop it. While there may be no imminent threat to my life that I'm aware of right now, guns serve the same purpose as fire extinguishers and life jackets -- they protect people in a life threatening emergency like a home invasion.

>See I'm confused here, you are portraying the pro-regulation crowd as being this united front that essentially wants to break down your door and steal the guns you own.

For most Democrats, gun control isn't a big deal. They vote for it because it's part of their party platform and because their whip tells them to, and a few crusaders use that to pass onerous regulation. However I still see them as complicit in the eroding of gun rights because of that.

Gun ownership is a fundamental part of American cultural identity. For many, it symbolizes independence and self-reliance: we will protect ourselves and not depend on our government to do it, and we stand ready to menace our government should they ever grow tyrannical (theoretically, anyway -- remember, this is about a symbolic statement). 

So any attempt to control or limit guns, by a kind of symbolic association, feels like an attempt to control or limit **freedom** and **independence**. 

Even the staunchest gun advocate cannot ignore that the U. S. alone among the developed nations of the world regularly has mass shootings, and has a homicide rate far higher than other countries of the developed world. The very simple difference is that in the U. S., it is easy to procure a gun, and in most of those countries it is not. Sorry to dash cold water on a lot of half-cocked theories about how civil we'd be if everybody wore a six-shooter on his hip, but obviously if we were to make it hard to purchase guns, we -- like the rest of the world that has done this -- would see fewer mass killings and fewer homicides, for the very simple fact that it's much easier to kill someone with a gun. 

But of course if we were to limit or control guns, we'd lose a part of our uniquely American mythos. This would affect political attitudes as well. I have no doubt that an unarmed America would be a less independent and self-reliant America.

I think that it's really interesting that you bring this up. As I've read American history, there's a reoccurring trend of conservative America feeling this ""cultural assault"" on their way of life. Slavery and de-segregation are the two big ones that come up for me. I""m not saying that gun owners are equivalent to slave-holders, but the logic is interestingly similar.
