Look at [the graph at the bottom of the page](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2013/12/fords-profits-in-latin-america-wiped-out-as-venezuela-devalues-currency-by-44/). Yes, there was a dip, but at the end of the 1980's they rose. What exactly happened since then? Apart from the recent dip in prices, prices stayed relatively high in that period. There is absolutely no reason for a reduction in oil exports **since 1999** other than the failure of the socialist state. The economy was doing well in that period, really well, until it crashed in 2008. 

And note, 95% of Venezuela's exports today is oil. That was not always the case.  

I do not think the recent collapse in the Venezuelan currency is anything natural or something that is supposed to happen. Naturally that is not the fault of Chavez, but it is the fault of the institutions he decided to put in place. 

Murder is up. 

While poverty and factors associate either have gone down slightly, it is going down when everyone is going down, and that to even maintain that level of growth it is forced to print more money. That caused the currency crisis as soon as Chavez left power and Venezuela is in a worse of position today because of that than it has been in its history. 

And there is ample evidence to suggest the Venezuela was a strong regional power in the Americans before 1999. I did exaggerate when I said global, but it's economy was no where near the mess it is in today and would not be if not for Hugo Chavez.

I think that social welfare states have the potential to work, given that a number of conditions are met. First and foremost, immigration must be tightly restricted. Illegal immigrants must be deported, or at the very least, barred from taking advantage of welfare programs. Also, unless someone can demonstrate that they bring some skill of value to the nation, they aren't allowed in. This basically rules out 99.9% of non-college educated people worldwide and even then, quite a few college educated people as well.

The immigration issue alone I think disqualifies America from being a candidate for an expansive welfare state. We clearly have enormous trouble keeping illegal immigrants out, otherwise they wouldn't comprise a population greater than America's 11 least populous states put together. Furthermore, we don't exactly have an aversion to immigration in general. Even among the ""Trump contingent"" there are those who have no problem with *legal* immigrants. Combine in the corporate influences that push for more ~~cheap labor~~ immigrants and you've got an environment where Norwegian immigration laws aren't ever going to be implemented.

""The effort to reduce mortgage lending standards was led by the Department of Housing and Urban Development through the 1994 National Homeownership Strategy, published at the request of President Clinton. Among other things, it called for “financing strategies, fueled by the creativity and resources of the private and public sectors, to help homeowners that lack cash to buy a home or to make the payments.” Once the standards were relaxed for low-income borrowers, it would seem impossible to deny these benefits to the prime market. Indeed, bank regulators, who were in charge of enforcing CRA standards, could hardly disapprove of similar loans made to better-qualified borrowers.""

""In a very real sense, the competition from Fannie and Freddie that began in late 2004 caused both the GSEs and the private-label issuers to scrape the bottom of the mortgage barrel. Fannie and Freddie did so in order to demonstrate to Congress their ability to increase support for affordable housing. The private-label issuers did so to maintain their market share against the GSEs’ increased demand for sub-prime and Alt-A products. Thus, the gradual decline in lending standards--beginning with the revised CRA regulations in 1993 and continuing with the GSEs’ attempts to show Congress that they were meeting their affordable housing mission--came to dominate mortgage lending in the United States.""

No.  Not capitalism.  Not free market economics. 

Make sure you have the right target in your sights. 

You are targeting crony crapitalism.  Government-infused crapitalism.  Unintended-consequences-of-government-intrusion-and-regulation crapitalism.  We don't have a true capitalist country anymore. 

One of the biggest drivers of the 2008 collapse:  The federal government's housing and loan regulations that made it way too easy for people to get mortgages that they couldn't afford. 

You see that a bank was associated with that and you immediately decry capitalism, conveniently ignoring that those banks were heavily influenced by government regulations.  

No rational bank would've loaned money to someone who couldn't afford to pay it back.  But, when the government provides the right incentives . . .

The solution is not to go full Bernie, though.  The solution is to decouple the incestuous relationships between the private and public sectors.  Never go full Bernie.

I already addressed this. Perhaps I should've used different wording or emphasis.

Government regulations pervert incentives and risk-assessment in the private sector.  And all you get is more trouble.  2008.  The student loan crisis, most recently.  We could make a list.
