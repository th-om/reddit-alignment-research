3kbd4z,"Why can men be charged more for car insurance, but women aren't charged more for health insurance?",302,ZenerDiod,"How is this legal?

EDIT: It seems some people have trouble understanding the very basic argument I'm putting forth so I'll explain.

Men cost more to insure as far as cars go.

Women cost more to insure as far as health go, even excluding maternity. 

It's illegal under Obamacare to price discriminate against women in the healthcare market

It's NOT illegal to discriminate against men in the car insurance market. 

Women are protected for price discrimination in the insurance markets that are unfavorable to them, while men are not. Which I don't feel is fair, or even under the 14th amendment even legal.",118,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kbd4z/why_can_men_be_charged_more_for_car_insurance_but/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441840723,1444730949
