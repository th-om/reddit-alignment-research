Russia only has to be strong in its neighborhood. The US, by virtue of our position in the global system, has to be strong everywhere. 

Does this mean that spending more on our military will make our many foreign policy headaches go away? Of course not. Those politicians ought to ask the Vietcong or the Taliban about the US military being so strong that no one would dare test it.

cvazlep,0,t1_cvawi94,BrawnyJava,"Some other interesting numbers:

In 1960, the US spent 50% of the total federal budget on defense spending.  1960 was between Korea and Vietnam, so no shooting wars at that time.  Today, we spend about 16% of the federal budget on defense.  

>while hard to achieve diplomatically, we could tell the nations we protect to protect themselves with less of our involvement and resources. 

I don't know how you could do that and make it stick.  As much as I'd like to do that, my concern is that EU would not increase their military capability and we'd end up getting sucked into another war there.  

I don't like the fact that the US tolerates genocide in Syria.  I'm positive we would not sit on the sidelines if that was happening in Rome or Paris.  In my mind, deterrence is cheaper than fighting, in lives at least if not money. ",5,0,1442978380,1444725225

cvat6ek,1,t3_3m020n,AMatterofTrust,"Well the reason we spend more on the military than the next few countries combined is that we are a global military superpower, the only one. Additionally, we have quite a large budget (in comparison to other countries.) While a military conquest of the US is pretty much impossible, (where would you begin?), the US is expected to and wants to fight ISIS, FARC, Al-Shabaab, and others, to the extent of no other country, and given the size of the budget, that it makes no sense to talk about the US spending in terms of other countries. 

However, whether the US should increase this significance, (for example, the US is fighting ISIS in the middle east, terrorists in Syria, has some influence in Yemen, and FARC in Colombia, that it could not really pose much of a threat to Russia in Eastern Europe. Only the US does this, so this is unique to the United States) or lower this significance, is entirely up to who you are asking. Many, though not all, republicans in the debate want to increase this significance. 

In all, military spending in relation to other nations is not important, what matters is the question of how much influence should the United States exert on the world? That question is a lot more nuanced than you would expect. And as you saw in the debate the candidates respective views on the matter. ",7,0,1442966705,1444725225

cvaw01m,1,t3_3m020n,righthandoftyr,"Behind all the rhetoric and posturing, the simple truth is that the US military is in a sense, mercenaries.  Security is one of the main exports of the US.  Other countries give us favorable trade arrangements allowing our economy to prosper, because they know that the goodwill all those trade agreements bought them will pay off in spades when their warmongering neighbor starts massing tanks on their border.

The US has positioned itself as the world's policeman.  That does mean that we end up bearing an lot more responsibility and incur a lot more military expenses than other nations.  The flip side to that is that policemen get paid to do their jobs.  In our case, not directly, but more in a diplomatic version of 'being indebted to the godfather for a favor' kind of way.  Where you fall on the pragmatist-idealist spectrum will largely dictate if you think this is savvy realpolitik or crass imperialism.

We could absolutely slash the defense budget by quite a bit and still be safe from invasion.  It doesn't take nearly as strong a military as we have just to defend ourselves.  But if we did that, if we closed all the bases, mothballed the carriers, and just left the rest of the world to their own devices, it would be a massive shakeup of the geopolitical balance of power.  Everything would change, and when the dust settled we would not occupy nearly as advantageous a position as we did before.  Given how much of the prosperity of the US is based on international trade, this could have devastating consequences.

Some people acknowledge this, and just think that it would be worth taking the economic hit to be able to draw down the military, while I don't agree with their assessment, at least they have an intellectually consistent position.  Other people seem to think that we could dramatically slash the defense budget and everything else in the world would stay the same.  *Those* people are delusional.

**tl;dr - Our current levels of military spending have less to do with defense, and more to do with purchasing 'diplomatic capital' we can use to our advantage in other areas.

cvawu1c,1,t3_3m020n,kulturkampf,"I think there are two factors that cover this:

- Many other wealthy states just piggy back off of the US military and do not have any real need for a large, standing military capable of conducting significant military operations abroad. This describes really much of the 1st world countries. Russia & China alone are the very influential states that have to think of maintaining the military capability of invading a foreign state and staking their interests. 

- The US military relies on technological superiority more than other militaries. The US military, unlike the Iranians, Chinese or Russians, cannot sustain a significant amount of casualties without unrest at home. We've learned this since Vietnam and thus we know that we have to show complete technological dominance over our opponents ebcause if 20,000 kids end up dead there'll be a major blowback at home. 

- The US really does have a major export industry based off of their military technology being sold to places like South Korea, Israel, Saudi Arabia, etc.. 

- This military budget also lines the pockets of top industrialists & cronies of the elites. Why not keep it fat? lol. ",3,0,1442973302,1444725229

In the military tons of money is wasted yearly on projects that do nothing for defense, but put jobs in congressmans districts (remember those tanks the DOD didnt want a few years ago). Furthermore, in the nuclear age it is becoming increasingly useless to have a large army preped for a declared war with another rival power.

Yes, when we pull back, someone fills the void left by US power.

>Will we really weaken ourselves if we cut our budget by $300 billion--and still outspend every other individual country?

Absolutely, we used to maintain the capability to fight a war on two fronts (Based on World War II).  When we made modest cuts recently, it downgraded our capability to fighting a war on one front.

>The US spends over $600 billion a year on military. The next highest is China, spending over $150 billion a year. (The numbers vary, depending on your source, but it holds true that the US spends more than everyone else combined.)

The dollar figures are a little misleading sometimes.  For example, China doesn't publicly disclose all expenses.  They also pay their soldiers far less to be soldiers than the United States.

The US also has to adjust military tactics to new tactics.  For example, during the Cold War we built our military to combat another national enemy in the USSR.  Post-Cold War the enemies have been much more of the guerrilla variety, forcing Urban Combat, and inflicting casualties by deception (such as Roadside bombs).  The tactics to combat a foe like that are different and different technology needs to be researched for it, such as the ship-hull shaped truck to deflect blast power and increase survivability.
