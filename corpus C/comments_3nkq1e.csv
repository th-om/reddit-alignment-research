Only one candidate has announced anything that is different than Obama's position. 

[Earlier this year, the Feds raided Chinese birth rings for citizenship](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/03/03/california-chinese-birth-tourism-raids/24338087/).  Those individuals were stripped of citizenship and deported (some were already out of the country as they would birth and then leave).

The 2ed reads 'shale not be infringed' yet there are 20,000 gun laws infringing on the books. Most of them are not crazy as I don't want everyone owning full autos or RPGs (though I don't mind that you can if you jump through the hoops), but that is still infringing, and us compromising. On the other hand, anti-gun nuts have giving 0, I repeat, 0 back in compromising, I have even had some crazies tell me that the 'compromise' they are giving us is letting us keep some weapons, which is insane and not the definition of compromise.

There have been 0 roll backs on gun control when there are a few compromises the anti gun nuts can give us right now, taking SBRs and suppressors off the NFA registry for instance.

I would also listen to loosening restrictions on immigration if the other side was going to loosen firearms restrictions, but they never propse that and never will because their end goal is a total ban, many current sitting in office democrats have stated on record that they want all guns banned.

So, Gun rights do not effect other rights at all, as in the 310 million guns and roughly 100 million gun owners who never hurt another person.

People who use guns illegally, they do effect your right, but that has nothing to do with gun rights themselves as the people who use guns illegally could use any number of weapons which all fall under the 2ed amendment (It says arms, not firearms, so swords and knives even fall under the 2ed). Once someone does that, they no longer have the right to the 2ed as they have broken our civil contract.

so in essence, my right to own a gun will never effect you or your rights, but you seem to be advocating for them to be taken, which does in fact effect my rights. You are being hypocritical at best.

Not only all that, but there are more guns in america than ever, and homicide by firearm has gone down 49% since its peek in the 90s, seems to show poor support for gun control when the major gun control had a sunset in 04 yet gun crimes continued on their downward trend.",2,0,1444671265,1444718076

You've got that backward: the inability to compromise isn't creating extremism - extremism is creating the inability to compromise. The parties haven't simply forgotten how to compromise, they just aren't willing to. The real question is ""what's driving the extremism?"" One reason is that the [parties are farther apart ideologically than ever before](http://i.imgur.com/EZBD4dM.jpg) (notice the Democrats have shifted too), and thus less able to agree on things than ever before. But it's not ideology alone driving this. Parties no longer have to worry as much about winning over the center of the political spectrum. There's this vicious cycle/feedback loop called the “the great sorting” going on in which polarization begats more polarization. The idea is that the parties have “sorted” the country ideologically and geographically, the result being that they each have their own separate version of America they represent, are answerable to, and get elected by. This has the incestuous effect of each parties' “locked in” constituencies getting more and more extreme which each generation.
