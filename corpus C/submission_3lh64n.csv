3lh64n,Why hasn't a Libertarian-ish candidate tried running as a Democrat?,56,pleasure2kill,"I understand the small govt vs big govt differences - but hear me out first.

Most people I know who vote Democrat and aren't extremely into politics do so based mainly on social issues. They like the Democrats are generally more socially liberal and they don't want to vote for a Christian conservative who is against gay marriage and abortion, among other popular issues. 

True Libertarians like Gary Johnson pretty much believe in similar stances on social issues - including things like legalizing marijuana, which young liberals agree with as well.

I feel like a liberal voter who likes liberal social ideas could be enticed to also support the libertarian ideas of small government and lower taxes as well. Think about how many young, typically liberal people supported Rand Paul based mostly on social issues and noninterventionalism. 

I think it would be easier for a Libertarian to win over a high portion of Democrat voters as opposed to Republicans, since Republicans don't seem to be as receptive to socially liberal ideas and especially noninterventionalist foreign policy.

What do you think? Could you see a guy like Gary Johnson running as a Democrat? If Ron Paul had run as a Democrat would he have been more popular?",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lh64n/why_hasnt_a_libertarianish_candidate_tried/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442607928,1444726892
