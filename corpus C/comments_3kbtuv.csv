First off, the US runs giant deficits. Just because we spend 50% of GDP doesn't mean we intend to take in that much in taxes. Even if the US government spends 41% of its GDP, it only takes in 25%. It's a distinct possibility that Bernie Sanders intends to increase the deficit. His economics advisors are modern monetary theorists, an ideology notorious in their indifference to large government deficits.

It's possible Bernie Sanders legitimately believes that improving the system efficiency on such a mass scale will offset what percent of GDP he'd need to take in taxes. He's been trying to tout estate and financial transaction taxes as a solution, but those are minimal sources of revenue. You're right that the real source is going to have to come from income brackets and Bernie hasn't laid those out yet.

It's also possible he doesn't want to go full Scandinavia. Maybe go Continental Europe first and work his way up gradually. 

Either way, he wants to sell it. He's not just going to tax the top 10% at a higher rate and he knows it, but politicians love playing the ""middle class"" game. When you say middle class, you can mean the middle 30%, but the middle 80% think they're talking about you.",10,0,1441849033,1444730938

>It wouldn't make us sufficient if his goal was to perfectly copy Scandinavian government models, but it is sufficient for what he claims he wants to do

No it isn't. His proposals are not sufficient by any means. His financial transaction tax will not generate as much income as predicted, nor will only increasing top tax rates on the 1% to ~55% which was his ballpark figure be sufficient to fund what he wants to do.

This is because like most politicians he assumes the tax base won't change, that people won't respond to changes in taxes and adjust their behavior. It's back of the napkin calculation that doesn't pass the sniff test.",2,0,1441909100,1444730946

Sufficient to do what? He could definitely achieve his promises of a single payer healthcare system and free public college by either increasing the deficit or cutting spending elsewhere. It might not be the best decision for the country, but it is certainly possible.

It's more that he cites statistics, even from their own source with cherry picking. He says America has the highest childhood poverty rate among developed countries according to OECD statistics, but even using OECD metrics which is relative poverty and its uselessness as a poverty metric notwithstanding, Israel has more. 

He says Americans work more hours than any developed country, but Israel, Iceland, Ireland, Greece, Poland, Greece, and Hungary all have higher average hours worked, against using the same OECD statistics.

He says single payer is the only way to go for affordable care, but Germany, Switzerland, Israel, and Singapore all do not have single payer and all are more affordable than US; Israel and Singapore are less costly than every single payer system except Taiwan's.

He frequently does this, and while it's par for the course in politics, he's simply no exception. His populist rhetoric is simply more polished.

>He could definitely achieve his promises of a single payer healthcare system and free public college by either increasing the deficit or cutting spending elsewhere.

But that's not his claim. His claim isn't to fund it by taking funding from somewhere else too. It's inappropriate to address what his claim *could* be or make an argument for him when criticizing or venerating him.

>Again, I am defending Bernie's character, not his political ideology.

He seems genuine in his intentions, but sincerity doesn't necessarily imply honesty. I'd cynically say he's genuine and being politically expedient in his presentation of his views, even it means oversimplifying to the point of misleading.

Personally I'd love to sit down with him and get a clearer picture of what he means to see whether he's just being politically expedient, or genuinely believes things are as simple as he presents them. I disagree with most of his policy prescriptions, but perhaps he's open to being convinced differently about his.",1,0,1441932023,1444730946

So he messed up a little with his wording. He should have said we had the highest child poverty rate of all developed countries besides Israel (and Mexico) but he still drives home the same point.

> He says Americans work more hours than any developed country, but Israel, Iceland, Ireland, Greece, Poland, Greece, and Hungary all have higher average hours worked, against using the same OECD statistics.

I have the same response to this as the last one, although I don't ever remember him saying this to be honest.

Doesn't really feel like a mistake to me. He just says what he believes. 

I think there is a huge difference between being competent/correct and being genuine. Bernie Sanders has been saying the same stuff for 40 years and getting a couple of statistics wrong doesn't really make me doubt that. I'm personally supporting Biden at the moment because I think Sanders would be too much but I certainly respect him as a person.

An irrelevant point. Relative poverty is useless for apples to apples comparisons. It's based on below 50% of *that country's* median income, but numerous OECD countries have their *median* threshold at or below the US 50% threshold, which means by definition more people are poor by US standards in those countries.

>I have the same response to this as the last one, although I don't ever remember him saying this to be honest.

It's on his facebook pages, and I went to one of his town meetings and he said it explicitly.

You don't need to overstate a problem to say you want to improve things. If you have to resort to manipulating people to get them to support your preferred method, I will call you dishonest.

>Doesn't really feel like a mistake to me. He just says what he believes. 

There are plenty of people who believe the theory of evolution isn't correct and the Earth is 6000 years old too. Belief doesn't make you dishonest, but it doesn't insulate you from being wrong either.

> Bernie Sanders has been saying the same stuff for 40 years and getting a couple of statistics wrong doesn't really make me doubt that.

Oh I was brief. He gets tons of things wrong, and the fact he hasn't changed his tune in 40 years speaks more to being an ideologue.

>I'm personally supporting Biden at the moment because I think Sanders would be too much but I certainly respect him as a person.

I respect him as a person, but I don't respect his ideas or the laymen public's vindication of them.

Did you not read what I said at all? I specifically just said that he isn't perfectly copying their exact policies, but is getting a lot of his ideas from their government systems. He straight up says that he wants America to be more similar to Scandinavia.
