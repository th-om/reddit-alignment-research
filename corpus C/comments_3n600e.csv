Ok.

> 2) Term limits on all of congress (one term, 6 years). 

So everyone in Congress is going to be inexperienced? This doesn't sound like a very bright idea. Imagine a Congress where only Rand Paul and Ted Cruz types (youth and inexperience breeds idealism) run the ship. Seniority is *very* important in Congress. It makes sure only people who know what they're doing get to call the shots. There ought to be a higher bar for becoming a party leader than managing to win an election.

> 3) Someone that believes in the constitution before their political party 

Good.

> 4) Remove political parties off ballets and make it about peoples character and intelligence (its how all current companies run their business). 

That not exactly how *all* current companies run their businesses. Some people rise through the ranks of a company through sheer Machiavellianism. I'm not a huge fan of political parties, but I wouldn't do away with them. Its not like people are going to forfeit their political identities overnight. Instead, I'd make it easier for other parties to participate in the political process and encourage more diversity among the two major parties (Blue Dog Dems and Moderate Republicans).

> 5) Don't lie to the people, if you promise something in your campaign and you're voted in, fight for those things 

Some politicians lie, but plenty of them (especially those who have never held the office they're running for before) have no idea what they're capable of. Its more like they're outlining a list of things they'll try to do instead of what they'll actually get done. I'm sure Obama intended to close Gitmo, but someone probably pulled him aside once he became President-elect and said ""there's no way we can close Gitmo and remain safe and if you even try to do this some in the military/intelligence community are determined to make your time as president exponentially harder."" Saying ""I will try really really hard to get something done and might fail"" is not the same as saying ""I **promise** to do this if you elect me"".

> 6) Make Social Security optional or remove it. 

I'm ok with making it optional. Removing it seems implausible. Some people live only off social security checks. 

>Millennials think its a waste since they're told they won't get anything back. 7) bring more offshore jobs home, no option is off the table to get it done 

Who cares what they *think?* They won't have to worry about it for at least another 40 years. There are people who need those checks *right now*.

8) Put class size limits in place for education, hire more teachers if needed. Make it a priority. 

How is a school that can barely afford supplies for their students going to hire more teachers?

> 9) Congress should be paid their home states average salary. 

This makes zero sense. Salaries depend on two things: 1) the difficulty of the work. 2) the financial needs of the person doing the job. So someone who works 14 hours a day doing mentally strenuous work and has to buy numerous plane tickets every month is going to get paid the same as people in a state where most work in a small office or a factory?

> 10) If congress can't pass bills, or keep this country running, then they're suspended without pay with **no hopes of getting it back.**

This is a great idea if you want no one but the super wealthy to run for office. You're going to have a Congress full of Donald Trumps and Darrell Issas.

> 11) corporations need limits on political donation sizes. $10k max. 

Aren't you thinking of PAC's?

> 2) Term limits on all of congress (one term, 6 years).

I'm not sure what problem this is supposed to solve, but it certainly creates a whole host of other ones.

Not only would this utterly destroy any sort of institutional continuity, you would never have a Congress who understood from experience how Congress works. Every election, the House would have 435 Representatives who would have to introduce themselves to each other, get to know each other, and figure out where everyone is in the political landscape. And six years later, they're all fired and the process starts all over again. The only people left on Capitol Hill who have any experience in the legislative process will be lobbyists, who will happily steer each fresh class of newbie lawmakers towards the bills they want enacted.

This proposal also completely obliterates any semblance of accountability. After the electorate casts their votes on Election Day, they have absolutely no control of what their new Representatives says, does, or votes for during his term. At no point are they incentivized to ask what their constituents want or need; instead, they should be asking who can offer them the cushiest job once their term ends.

> 6) Make Social Security optional or remove it. Millennials think its a waste since they're told they won't get anything back.

Just because people are living into their 80s and 90s doesn't mean that they can still work. Your candidate would have to explain to grandparents with arthritis and osteoporosis and diabetes why they need to back into the job market—which is already struggling to reach and maintain healthy employment—or risk starvation. Not to mention plenty of younger people drawing a Social Security check due to a crippling disability. Like it or not, millions of Americans depend on Social Security to keep them housed, clothed and fed. Taking that away would have very real, very negative effects.

Also, AARP would torpedo any candidate who even hinted at something like this, and I wouldn't blame them in the slightest.

> 7) bring more offshore jobs home, no option is off the table to get it done

Okay. How?

> 8) Put class size limits in place for education, hire more teachers if needed. Make it a priority. 

The President doesn't really have much say here; I'd talk to your Governor instead.

> 10) If congress can't pass bills, or keep this country running, then they're suspended without pay with no hopes of getting it back.

How many bills do they need to pass? Do they have to have any particular subject, or do bills renaming post offices count? Can we have a budget shutdown if it just lasts a few hours? Are continuing resolutions okay?

And if they have ""no hopes of getting [their pay] back,"" then why even bother legislating anymore? The 104th Congress wasn't even a year into its term when it shut down the government for a sum total of 4 weeks. If that happened with your 6-year, 1-term Congress, then they would have no incentive to not go looking for other jobs, and the American people could easily go for 5 years with no federal legislature.",2,0,1443747241,1444720787
cvmfaz0,0,t1_cvl6kym,soitcause,For #2 they could do something similar to the Senate elections where the elections are staggered so that people come/go gradually. Could even split it into six cycles of elections so you have cohorts of senators rising/graduating every year.,1,0,1443841435,1444720791

cvmjlmx,0,t1_cvmh8j7,soitcause,"I feel like our current system has those same issues (barring the first, of course, but even that isn't necessarily a bad thing). There are too many career politicians that solely vote party lines instead of striving toward the best legislation for their constituents and the greater American people. Hopefully with term limits we'd see more actually working to change things like what happens with a lot of second term presidents.",1,0,1443853273,1444720791
cvmwios,0,t1_cvmjlmx,ShimmerScroll,"Congressional delegates vote along party lines because that's what their constituents want. Remember, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor dabbled ever so slightly in bipartisanship, and he got so thoroughly crushed in the primary that he didn't even finish out his term. Voters in his district saw their interests lying in a stronger, ideologically purer Republican Party. A similar phenomenon has been playing out in districts across the country, places that are so entrenched in one party or the other that candidates have to worry less about the other party and more about being seen as insufficiently loyal to the Cause.

Term limits aren't going to fix this. In fact, I submit that they would only exacerbate the problem. Fresh legislators don't have a record to run on, and voters would have no reason to realistically expect that they would actually stand up to party leadership when it was legitimately in the district's best interests. Plus, in an environment where less than 10% of seats are legitimately contested by more than one party, new legislators have to toe the party line if they ever hope to make it to the general election. Term limits would only strengthen the stranglehold that the parties hold over the electoral process in most of the country.

This problem would be much more effectively approached through electoral reform. Implementing a system like single transferable vote would promote a more diverse and representative legislature and help loosen the reins of party leadership on their actions. Alternatively, we could embrace the party system more fully by implementing some form of proportional representation.

I also don't understand this opposition to professional legislators. Congress is, in many respects, a group project with hundreds of teammates. It takes time for any group to settle into a productive working pattern, let alone one that large, and continually replacing the whole body means that valuable time for debating and legislating is instead spent bringing everybody up to speed on how the process works and waiting for them to find their place in it. This is always going to be an issue in any democratic government, but I see little point in making it worse. Furthermore, these people are managing the world's largest economy, overseeing its most powerful military, and governing its third most populous nation with laws that routinely run for hundreds or thousands of pages.

Not impossible, but there would have to be significant cuts associated with it

>2) Term limits on all of congress (one term, 6 years)

My problem with this is it takes a lot of accountability out of the process. With 2 year terms congressmen have to continually prove themselves to their district. If they only get one term and it lasts 6 years there is no incentive for them to keep any of their promises

>3) Someone that believes in the constitution before their political party

This is pretty uncontroversial. Although keep in mind that the constitution is not a holy document set in stone, it can be changed

> 4) Remove political parties off ballets and make it about peoples character and intelligence

Political parties do serve as a simple way for people to know which candidates align with them. Do you really expect people to do extensive research into their vote for Comptroller or Dogcatcher? I think this would result in drastically decreased voter turnout

>5) Don't lie to the people, if you promise something in your campaign and you're voted in, fight for those things 

Sure, this is all well and good. But its going to be much harder to enforce with a one-term limit.

Optional Social Security defeats the point of Social Security. It exists specifically for people who don't think they will need it.

War? I dont really know what you mean by this. But economically, specialisation generally always leads to cheapre good and better jobs than isolationism

I agree with this. But it will be expensive.

I don't agree with this. We should want the best of the best to be repesenting us in Congress, not the average, there should be some economic incentive. Also, being a congressman is really expensive, you have to basically pay for 2 homes, in DC and in your home state.

There are Bills on the seante floor as we speak which will stop congress from getting paid during Govt shutdowns
