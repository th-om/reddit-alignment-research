3mzpk4,What's the difference between the left and right?,40,RationalRattachist,"This came up on the Nazi thread, but I'd say the difference is their attitude to hierarchy.

Right wing movements are about hierarchy, order and respect for authority with a rejection or indifference of the concept of equality.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mzpk4/whats_the_difference_between_the_left_and_right/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443634348,1444721407
