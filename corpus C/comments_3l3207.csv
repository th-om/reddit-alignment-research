The left is pushing hard for fully socialize healthcare.

* government payers like Medicare and Medicaid
* FDA
* professional licensing

The general free market response to this is that hospitals can make reasonable assumptions about whether someone wants to be treated or not.  Nothing about that militates against free market ideas.  

The problem of the uninsured is dealt with in two ways,

1)  Free market policies make healthcare more personally and widely available.  Right now, healthcare insurance has to meet fairly high standards to avoid the tax or penalty at the end of the year.  It's a one-size fits all approach.  For example, a 28 year old male that bought catastrophic insurance (the lowest insurance) for 1500/year will have a child covered for dental care after deductible.  Sounds great, right?  What if he doesn't have a child?  He still has to pay for the service.  In a free market, he could ask to exchange this service for a lower premium or deductible, or the addition of a comparable service.    

Personalize healthcare and it will be cheaper and more widely available.  

2)  There will be a 'free rider' problem.  That is inevitable.  Still, no one wants to spend years in debt and the incentive to get health insurance is very high (especially when it costs $50 a month instead of 150).  Those that do not and cannot pay back in full will be picked up by others and insurance companies will adjust their premiums accordingly.    ",1,0,1442359864,1444728122

cv3mowo,0,t1_cv3jeei,rlobster,"It doesn't counter it and I wasn't saying it does. The reviewed studies rather show a low price elasticity for demand. The elasticity is higher with higher coinsurance rates, however demand remains relatively inelastic.

As it is a literature review and not a single study it is impossible to quote all results.

This quote is from the summary (page xi):
""Despite a wide variety of empirical methods and data sources, the
demand for health care is consistently found to be price inelastic.
Although the range of price elasticity estimates is relatively wide, it
tends to center on –0.17 [...]""

From Chapter 3, Review of the empirical literature, results from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) (page 26):
""For coinsurance rates between 0 and 25 percent,
the price elasticity of medical expenditures was found to be
–0.17. Consistent with the patterns seen in observational studies, the demand for health care was found to be somewhat more price sensitive as the coinsurance rate increased. In the HIE, coinsurance rates between 25 and 95 percent yielded elasticity estimates of –0.22. The magnitude of the elasticities estimated from the HIE fall at the lower end of the range of previous estimates."" 

So while higher higher out of pocket expenditure through cost-sharing mechanisms can reduce demand for health care, the effect may be less than you would expect (granted you didn't put a figure). Additionally as I was pointing out reducing any demand for health care is not necessarily advantageous.

Again from the HIE results (page 26):
""The cost-sharing strategies worked to reduce use by reducing the number of treatment episodes and not by reducing intensity of treatment once an individual accessed the medical care system (Keeler and Rolph, 1983). The reductions in episodes were spread across situations both where medical treatment would be highly effective (an infection that can be treated with antibiotics) and where medical treatment would likely provide the fewest benefits (a flu caused by a virus) (Lohr et al., 1986). This result indicates that cost-sharing is an imprecise way to reduce less appropriate care.""

So how do you reform the market?

First, you'd outlaw the particularly loathesome health care industry practices, like insurance companies denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions, due to annual/lifetime coverage maximums, or due to ridiculously high annual deductibles without any kind of provision for co-pays for preventative care. Essentially, consumer protection laws, to make sure there aren't trap garbage insurance plans on the market.

Then, you'd mandate that everyone has to have health insurance so they don't just take advantage of the new regulations on the insurance system by only signing up once they're sick or injured.

Then, you set up a system of subsidies for low-income individuals so that mandate doesn't have an undue negative impact on them, and while you're at it, set up a marketplace to help people comparison shop for their insurance.

In other words, you implement the Affordable Care Act. If you want to go further, I'd suggest changing the employer mandate so it requires employers to provide a voucher instead of allowing employers to dictate which health insurance company their employees have access to.

What you should be asking is for something good *that reasonable conservatives will approve of*.  Ultimately, anything *other* than a free market solution has some non-conservative elements, at least in the way conservatism is practiced today, and as you've acknowledged, free market health care would be a complete failure.

The problem, of course, is that the payers and providers have power and the patient does not.  The patient needs the services, period.  The provider can charge whatever it wants and the patient will have to pay it.  The payer can negotiate that price down, since if the provider does not accept the payer's demands, the provider will lose the payer's patients, but on the other hand, the payer has to accept the provider's terms, because if not, patients will choose other payers.  But the patient?  No power.  Especially in an employer-based system, the patient has no choices at all.  The patient *has* to get health care, and he already has a payer and has to find a provider on that payer's list.

The only solution without more tightly regulating the payers and providers is to give the patient more power.  But the patient industry doesn't hire lobbyists or make campaign contributions, so yeah.

Not entirely true.  First, there can be competition for services.  We all need food, right?  Yet, we have *huge* choices in regard to food because we allow competition in the market.  Competition drives down prices.  Second, we actually *do* make choices about whether or not we want some healthcare services and not others.  Cheaper healthcare means more people using more healthcare services because not everything is a health *necessity*.

Not exactly.

I could probably sell you some food right now.  I *definitely* couldn't sell you a brain operation.  The difference is that I haven't gone to eight (or however many) years of medical school with a specialty in neurosurgery.  It's *really hard* to be qualified to perform brain surgery, and it's *really hard* to have the facilities and equipment required to make it happen, etc.  Not to mention, how many people really need brain surgery nearby?  I'm sure all of the neurosurgeons in my area have patients.  If I need neurosurgery, I have a few local hospitals I can go to.  There might be two or three surgeons who can perform the specific procedure I need.  And if I don't get this surgery, I DIE.

It's not that competition isn't allowed.  It's that the costs to actually do the thing are huge, and there's not enough volume to justify a neurosurgery shop in every street corner next to the local Dunkin'.  (On the other hand, apparently dentistry is really easy to do, because dentists *are* at every street corner next to the local Dunkin'.  I'm going to blame the local Dunkin'.)",1,0,1442361037,1444728126
