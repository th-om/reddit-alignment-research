cuyk4yp,1,t3_3klyzc,evanb_,I think the church issues were much more serious for Obama than the blind racism. The church issue could convince a reasonable person not to vote for him if he hadn't addressed it.,7,0,1442019839,1444729821
cuyj9pf,1,t3_3klyzc,mrmoustache8765,There was a very tiny amount of the voting population who actually took the whole Muslim/birther thing seriously. Hilary however had trustworthiness issues even before the whole email scandal broke. Hilary's emails are by far the bigger problem.  ,7,0,1442018029,1444729821
cuz0db7,1,t3_3klyzc,molotoviphone,"There is definitive proof that Obama was not a Kenyan Muslim. 

There is definitive proof that Clinton did have a private email server. 

Whether the server is actually a legal problem, at least it is a real thing. ",4,0,1442069907,1444729821
cuyj501,1,t3_3klyzc,crateguy,"I don't think Clinton's email ""scandal"" is a problem for her.  For the majority of voters, party affiliation is all that matters.  If she is the Democratic nominee for president, then Democrats will vote for her.  The only people truly concerned about the email nonsense are her opponents and their constituants, they weren't going to vote for her anyway.  Political campaigns aren't run these days based on the merits of their politicians, they are run based on the fear they can generate in their base of the alternative.",5,0,1442017766,1444729821

cuyospz,1,t3_3klyzc,DevonWeeks,"Obama was too unknown to have many problems.  The whack jobs of the right came up with some stuff, but mostly he was just an amateur with an extremist pastor and questionable mentors.  That just doesn't compare with Hillary who has a list of scandals longer than your arm and has actually had people go to jail as a result of her scandals.  Her husband had to pardon people who fell on the sword for the Clintons in the Whitewater scandal, for example.  Obama never had anything like that in his history.  I don't think the two are comparable.",3,0,1442030064,1444729821
cuypa8d,1,t3_3klyzc,yabbadabbadoo1,Being investigated by the FBI that could end with felony charges are defiantly more severe. It's been pretty obvious given how quickly Hillary is dropping in the polls among Sanders and Biden and among Republicans.,2,0,1442031274,1444729821
cuyizl4,1,t3_3klyzc,Quetzalcoatls,Clinton is being investigated by the FBI for running a private server that contained classified information and in all likelihood was breached by foreign intelligence due to improper security procedures. The public could literally 100% not care at all about this issue and it could still threaten her campaign for the Presidency. I would be interested in hearing an argument from someone who thinks the Kenyan Muslim controversy is somehow a bigger problem.,4,0,1442017456,1444729821
cuyknlm,1,t3_3klyzc,repmack,Which one has the chance of sending you to prison or making a criminal record? It is obvious which one is more damaging.,2,0,1442020928,1444729821
cuyq198,1,t3_3klyzc,koleye,"I don't think it's fair to compare the two problems because the circumstances surrounding the 2016 election are so different from those of the 2008 election.

The America of 2008 was in far worse shape than the America of 2015. In 2008 we were still fighting two long wars with no end in sight, and the economy was collapsing. Barack Obama was the only legitimate contender for the President who wasn't really part of the old guard in Washington. His message of hope and change resonated precisely because of the depressing situation the country was in. A lot of people were willing to overlook any problems his campaign had because we wanted someone new and different.

The America of 2015 is doing pretty well. The economy is fairly strong, the Iraq War is over (although it has evolved into a different beast), and the campaign is already shaping up to be dominated by foreign policy, which hasn't really been the case for a Presidential election since 1972. People are more critical of a candidate's problems because the country isn't facing an imminent crisis.

We also have to remember that Obama and Clinton have very different personalities. Obama is a very charming and likable person. Hillary comes across as cold, distant, and artificial. Obviously these qualities are subjective to an extent, but there are the generally accepted descriptions of their personalities. Hillary's approval ratings were through the roof during her tenure as Secretary of State and before launching her current campaign because she wasn't as visible a public official as she had been previously. Now that she is again more prominent in public life, people are more critical of her.",0,0,1442033224,1444729821

This may have more to do with the American public's inability to relate to a woman than their actual personalities.",-2,0,1442067624,1444729825

cuzk585,0,t1_cuz2lyr,glbrown4,"I guess what I was getting at is that men can almost always relate to another man, which helps in a male dominated society. While so many women (even though they make up the majority of voters) have been conditioned to resent other women. 

Hillary comes from a time where women had to work harder to get where they are. That tenacity comes off as strange and even off putting to many people today because it seems unnecessary. 

This mildly sexist framing of her personality continues and will help Bernie seem more likeable because he is infact a ""nice guy"". Just some thoughts... ",1,0,1442106095,1444729825
