1.  People who claim that black people will vote for a candidate just because they're black, or women will vote for a candidate just because they're a woman, and therefore it's advantageous to be a minority.

2.  People pointing out that being a white male makes it easier to get nominated for office, and that people are just as willing, if not more so, to vote *against* a candidate because they're black or a woman (even if they're not as willing to [admit it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect)).",9,0,1444069221,1444717934
cvp6y8o,1,t3_3nla0l,Grundelwald,"It's hard to say, considered Obama has been the only minority candidate to be in a general presidential election. Looking at the data, Obama performed very similarly to other democrats across all demographics. Sure, he got a higher share of African American votes by a few percentage points, but when the Democrats are already pulling ~90% of the black vote, I don't think it's too significant when that becomes 95% with Obama. ",4,0,1444070908,1444717934
cvqnim2,0,t1_cvp6y8o,tehfunnymans,"He may have performed about as well as most democrats tend to, but that itself is evidence that something (I can't think of any possibilities besides race, but I'm open to other suggestions) was holding him back.  Consider what was going on in 2008.  The economy was in the tank, unemployment was sky high, and Bush's approval rating was about as low as presidential approval has ever gotten.  All of those tend to mean that the incumbent's party will lose, and lose big.  The Democrats should have won in a landslide (and they did, in the House of Representatives).  But Obama didn't do that well.  His winning margin was comfortable but not a landslide.  

More importantly, he received roughly the same percentage of the white vote ([43%](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html)) as John Kerry did in 2004 ([41%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008#Voter_demographics)).  Kerry lacked Obama's charisma, and he lacked Obama's advantages from the economy.  Kerry was running against an incumbent rather than for an open seat.  The Iraq war had not yet devolved into the quagmire it eventually became when Obama ran.  But none of these differences led to a meaningful change in the white vote.  Are whites' votes unaffected by how well the economy is doing?  Do whites not care about becoming bogged down in unpopular wars?  Because unless we account for racism draining white votes from Obama, it sure looks like they aren't and they don't.  

[This article](http://archives.cerium.ca/IMG/pdf/lewis-beck-tien-nadeau.pdf) has a good overview of the academic studies on what race did to Obama (pp 72-73).  Only one of the studies it reviews found a net positive effect for race on Obama's victory, and that study ignored the white vote and economic conditions.  The estimates they provide for how much race harmed (on net - they account for potential positives) Obama range between 2 and 5% of the national popular vote.  ",1,0,1444171967,1444717934

If you have a decent or good candidate which is a minority or a woman, then that will be seen as just icing on the cake.  Black people won't vote for just any black candidate, but they will if it's a pretty good black candidate. Same with women.

cvpqefz,1,t3_3nla0l,ZenerDiod,"Depends...I'm a black man but I'm convinced the Republican party would rally around a charastmic black leader like nothing you've seen before.

I've lived in a farmer town with ""redneck"" redditers would look down on as racist. They're not really that racist, in certain way I like them more then the englighted college educated liberals because they don't assume they know anything about black people and their problems, and have welcomed me into their homes many times never making me feel like an outsider. T

What they don't like is the black culture of ignorance that they see on tv and hear in rap music, and they're not going to mince words when it comes to calling that culture out for what it is. What they don't like is how it's fine for them to be called white trash and no one comes to defend that biogtry. What they like is their religion and economic values. They do like the African American humor and many elements of the culture.

If you had a black man who had a charismatic conservative message, they would love him like no other. They'd could finally have someone speak for them that the left couldn't shut down by claiming racism.

cvp2iqz,1,t3_3nla0l,ClockOfTheLongNow,"Generally, being a minority *currently* is going to be a net benefit with some caveats.  We're still really overly focused on race in the United States, so the opportunity to vote for a woman or minority is seen as a benefit for a number of voters, and this is true on both sides of the spectrum: the left will often see it as a social commentary, the right as a chance to show that such identifications actually exist in conservative politics.  

These benefits, however, generally only work out for the left wing candidates.  Right wing conservative minorities in particular get a lot of unnecessary guff from their left wing opponents, from the treatment of [Clarence Thomas] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/04/30/black-congressman-stands-by-comment-that-clarence-thomas-is-an-uncle-tom/) to [Sarah Palin] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/28/AR2010052802263.html) to [Bobby Jindal] (http://www.addictinginfo.org/2015/06/29/message-piyush-bobby-jindal-indian-american-race-shame-video/) to more extreme examples like [Mia Love] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/28/mia-love-racist-attacks_n_1923343.html).  The benefits that minority candidates will get from the left largely stem from the sort of boost the left believes minorities should get in private life as well, but the carryover doesn't occur to the right.

Overall, that sort of mentality is why people like Elizabeth Warren and Rachel Dolezal see a benefit in self-identifying in questionable ways.  There is a net benefit, especially in electoral politics.  We've largely (but not completely) moved past the point of race being a hindrance and swung to the other side.  Thankfully, I think the election of Obama is going to help settle things out a bit, and when we eventually get a female president (on either side of the aisle), that will help as well.  That doesn't mean we can't do more as voters to look at issues and priorities instead of identities in the short term, though.",0,0,1444064301,1444717950
