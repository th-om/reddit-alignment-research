cvjixgc,1,t3_3mzh5s,QuantumDischarge,">So what was the military spending $2 billion a week on, in Iraq

Logistics to keep thousands upon thousands of American soldiers and civilians safe in country where practically everyone wanted them dead. 

>they lost $12 billion in cash that was delivered on pallets, and just vanished with absolutely no accounting of it

Source?

> yet Republicans as saying that if we don't give them more, they just can't protect us

I take it you have no idea how deterrence works. If countries see weakness in our foreign presence they will try to fill it as quickly as possible. By having a forward-projecting military force, we assure that we are able to act in our best interests anywhere, at any time.

The government has very little control of its income and worries tremendously about money.  It is incredibly tight about what it spends money on.

Private industry spends borrowed money or profits.  And it can raise the price if it needs more money.  Private industry wastes money like it is water.

It is certainly true that spending in war zones is wasteful and hard to track.  But that is hardly a measure of how government spending generally works.
