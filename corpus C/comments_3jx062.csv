The key difference between a true socialist state and a fascist state is fascism reached its intended goal. Socialists planned to eventually phase the government out but no socialist state has actually achieved that point (since it's not really feasible due to human nature). Democratic Socialism I don't think has any intention of phasing out government in the long run though. They are adopting a more fascist stance, but instead of a dictator they still use a democracy/republic. Again I am only talking about the ""economic"" platforms and positions of the fascists regimes. Some associate Fascism with ""Authoritarian"". So my above comment might confuse them greatly.

Mussolini who coined fascism and wrote the document that founded the movement (though the movement kind of existed before him but without much form) was a self professed socialists and was active in the socialist parties and politics (until roughly 1922). The language he uses in his essay is strikingly familiar to the communist manifesto. While he trashes every other economic system he only claims fascism was a natural evolution of socialism (such as the ideas of socialism lead to this realization).

I could start talking about the National Socialist Party and the Nazi spin on fascism (which again is very in line with socialist thought) but that makes socialists really angry. Socialists were killed by fascists in large numbers which some how makes people believe they must be complete opposites. ""If someone kills another person than they are obviously nothing alike"". It is easy to see the faulty reasoning, but to this day it is preached that Fascism is a ""right wing"" ideology. And in the European sense of politics it has a grain of truth to it. In the American sense of ""right"" and ""left"" it is completely false.

Socialism and Fascism are pretty similar, Fascism just doesn't make any bones about being nationalist, racist, or otherwise traditionalist.  It is pretty solidly *against* private ownership of goods or industries, preferring for worker or government ownership -- just like the real-world implementations of socialism.  Fascism eschews the social concepts that were more or less the only things the socialists got right.

By that logic, then neither did the Soviet Union, but suggesting that ""they weren't socialist"" is about as much bullshit as suggesting ""the United States isn't capitalist.""  They sure don't meet the ideological purity of the internet denizens donning their labels in the 21st century, but to their acolytes, leaders, and founders... they were the best shot they had ever had (although this is somewhat untrue -- the Founders of the United States were loyal to *freedom* and *natural rights*, rather than to capitalism, which simply happens to emerge from such a system).

>It is fundamentally the purest expression of right politics, total class war against proletarian power...

False.  ""In 1918, Mussolini defined what he viewed as the proletarian character, defining proletarian as being one and the same with producers, a productivist perspective that associated all people deemed productive, including entrepreneurs, technicians, workers, and soldiers as being proletarian.  He acknowledged the historical existence of both bourgeois and proletarian producers, but declared the need for bourgeois producers to merge with proletarian producers.""

Not if there is demand. That is the real problem though.

You are proving my point. Employers have no say in an employees value. Because there are other teams that could and would employ that player they must compete in a free market to procure that player. It works exactly the same with walmart employees except there is a huge supply and demand is low relative to supply. Once again, walmart creates demand and increases value for unskilled labor.

>The difference is a market of one side naming numbers vs a market of two-way conversations between parties with negotiation power.

I am not so sure you understand what a market actually is or how it works. A market is always a two way conversation. How do you think jobs work. Do you think walmart goes out with a tranquilizer and a cage to get employees? They put in applications saying they want a job and start a conversation about their employment. Walmart responds and tells them they can have the job with a certain compensation. The employee can then take part in the consenting agreement or attempt to find employment somewhere else. If walmart is paying $7.50, and kmart is paying $8.50 and there is a scarcity for employees, walmart will have to increase wages or be understaffed. The problem now is that unemployment is high enough (unemployment means supply of workers is greater than demand for workers) that walmart can still fill all there positions without really competing. That is the problem. Walmart helps increase demand, but even still demand is less that the supply. This is the problem the must be fixed and there is no other way to solve the problem.

No, it's not. 18,500 is not a very large number for a market of 157,000,000, especially when you consider that the US isn't really a single marketâ€”it's a bunch of smaller markets divided by geography.

Let's break that down to the county level. The US has 3144 counties. If that divided evently (which it absolutely doesn't, but this is for a simple illustration of scale), that works out to a market of 6 major firms buying labor from a pool of 25,000 individual actors.

That leaves 5,998,500 small businesses, each employing an average of 13 people.

Let's divide that on a per-county basis again, to give this a more manageable scale. 6 firms each employ ~4200 people per county, and an additional ~1908 firms employ 13 people apiece.

I don't necessarily disagree, but my preferred solution is to minimize the government to responsibility over a few key areas and never let it beyond that - the wealthy are attracted to influence government because if they don't, their competitors will.

The government is power.  People who possess power aren't going to let another powerful organization trample over them with nary a peep, they're going to make sure that they emerge from the government's acting in the best way possible.

This is my main gripe with socialism:  You have an arbitrary line (called ""wealthy,"" and which none of you agree on) at which point everyday, commonplace interactions suddenly become forbidden.  If I buy a $20 projector off of a Facebook buy/sell group, and then I turn right around and flip that projector for $80, I've made $60 in profit.

Well, we disagree.  I'd say someone that has built a business in %FIELD% is eminently more qualified to continue making decisions on business, *especially* in that field, than anyone else.  Oh, also, they earned that money, so who the fuck are you (or the government) to up and take it away from them?

>Just because you have experience with large sums of money doesn't mean you are good at allocating it.

Just because you won a popularity contest doesn't mean you have experience allocating more resources than any single person on the market does.  At least the person who obtained a large some of money *somehow* demonstrated his/her prowess in that feat, the people YOU want managing resources just convinced everyone to vote for them!  How does convincing people to vote for you imply that you'll be good at managing national resources?!?

>Some people might embody that rags to riches fairytale, but a lot of people make a lot of money mainly through the exploitation of ""lesser"" workers or through accident of birth (see Trump).

But most billionaires *didn't* inherit their wealth.  Most of them earned it, by building organizations that produced goods and services that a *great* many of us found to be useful.  They built instruments that were of profound value to *millions* of people.  

I think that should be rewarded.

>>...who's economic understanding is ""I don't really like to pay for things

>You mean pay for ""things"" like government programs that were created specifically to help them out? 

It doesn't matter if they were created specifically to help them out.  Yet another criticism of socialism:  Your morals about how people live means *fuck all* in helping them.  Wealth does.  Strong economies do.  Good products that do more for people while requiring fewer resources to be pulled from the Earth's crust than older products, help people.

>Do you see rich people jumping out of their Numi's to give their money to the goverment? Neither do I. In fact I see the opposite. I see rich people colluding to ensure that their taxes remain low.
