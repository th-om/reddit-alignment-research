Bush and his administration rightly claimed links between Iraq and Al Qaeda, and those nonoperational links were confirmed by intelligence and the 9/11 Commission, but the Bush administration learned very early on in the investigations that Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks and went to great lengths to note exactly that.

To answer your broader question, there doesn't appear to be actual fault in how the investigation went down, nor is the official story unbelievable in any way.  There may be classified details we're currently not privy to, but in terms of the basics (an attack by 18 Al Qaeda hijackers organized by the top officers of the organization, including Osama bin Laden), it looks pretty cut and dry.

""The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and al Qaeda: because there was a relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda,"" Bush said after a Cabinet meeting. As evidence, he cited Iraqi intelligence officers' meeting with bin Laden in Sudan. ""There's numerous contacts between the two,"" Bush said. ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50679-2004Jun17.html)

Bush reaffirmed the White House position in even stronger terms in a press conference on 21 August 2006. When asked what the connection was between Iraq and the September 11th attacks, Bush replied, ""Nothing....

To quote Lee Hamilton, a Democrat on the Commission:

> I must say I have trouble understanding the flack over this. The Vice President is saying, I think, that there were connections between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein’s government. We don’t disagree with that. What we have said is we don’t have any evidence of a cooperative, or a corroborative relationship between Saddam Hussein’s government and these al Qaeda operatives with regard to the attacks on the United States. So it seems to me the sharp differences that the press has drawn, the media has drawn, are not that apparent to me.

He also said something similar on *Hardball*:

> There are all kinds of ties. There are all kinds of connections. And it may very well have been that Osama bin Laden or some of his lieutenants met at some time with Saddam Hussein lieutenants.  They had contacts, but what we did not find was any operational tie with respect to attacks on the United States.

Another Commission member, John Lehman, had this to say on *Meet the Press*:

> The Clinton administration portrayed the relationship between al- Qaeda and Saddam’s intelligence services as one of cooperating in weapons development. There’s really very little difference between what our staff found, what the administration is saying today and what the Clinton administration said. The Clinton administration portrayed the relationship between al- Qaeda and Saddam’s intelligence services as one of cooperating in weapons development. There’s abundant evidence of that. In fact, as you’ll soon hear from Joe Klein, President Clinton justified his strike on the Sudan “pharmaceutical” site because it was thought to be manufacturing VX gas with the help of the Iraqi intelligence service.  Since then, that’s been validated. There has been traces of Empta that comes straight from Iraq, and this confounds the Republicans, who accused Clinton of doing it for political purposes. But it confirms the cooperative relationship, which were the words of the Clinton administration, between al-Qaeda and Iraqi intelligence... The Bush administration has never said that they participated in the 9/11 attack. They’ve said, and our staff has confirmed, there have been numerous contacts between Iraqi intelligence and al-Qaeda over a period of 10 years, at least. And now there’s new intelligence, and this has come since our staff report has been written because, as you know, new intelligence is coming in steadily from the interrogations in Guantanamo and in Iraq and from captured documents. And some of these documents indicate that there is at least one officer of Saddam’s Fedayeen, a lieutenant colonel, who was a very prominent member of al-Qaeda. That still has to be confirmed. But the vice president was right when he said that he may have things that we don’t yet have.

>Earlier today, I ordered America's armed forces to strike military and security targets in Iraq. They are joined by British forces. Their mission is to attack Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors.

>Their purpose is to protect the national interest of the United States, and indeed the interests of people throughout the Middle East and around the world.

>Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms, poison gas or biological weapons.

>I want to explain why I have decided, with the unanimous recommendation of my national security team, to use force in Iraq; why we have acted now; and what we aim to accomplish.

>Six weeks ago, Saddam Hussein announced that he would no longer cooperate with the United Nations weapons inspectors called UNSCOM. They are highly professional experts from dozens of countries. Their job is to oversee the elimination of Iraq's capability to retain, create and use weapons of mass destruction, and to verify that Iraq does not attempt to rebuild that capability.

cuy8zih,0,t1_cuy8o7b,kingvitaman,"Ha. Did you realize I put the term ""Troofer"" in the title of this post? I am by no means a truther ( doubling down on the strawman I see), but I""ll still wait to see how you say I have a disregard for the facts by quoting Cheney who spoke about the connection between Iraq and 911 ( by speaking out on more than one occasion about the meeting between Atta and senior Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague) . If this is the point of contention, or if you don't think that Cheney said this, or that it is somehow taken out of context then I'd be interested in seeing what you have to say.  I don't believe in any conspiracy regarding that Bush brought down the towers, however I do believe the 911 was a catalyst and used as leverage in order to achieve goals unrelated to 911 ( invasion of Iraq).

cuy3rt7,1,t3_3kiyui,iliveintexas,"I don't subscribe to any of the ""9/11 Truther"" conspiracy, other than I do suspect the U.S. Government (either Clinton or Bush, Jr.) had several prior hints as to an attack but Bush chose to cover it up afterwards to not appear incompetent.

Of course, hindsight is always 20/20.

But, to be clear, I in no way believe that Bush ""let 9/11 happen."" That would be political suicide for the Republican Party.",2,0,1441991489,1444730134

cuynn3u,1,t3_3kiyui,DannyXopher,"I believe the official account. 

Did the U.S. ""let"" it happen? Not directly. I think the U.S. said ""If something happens, then so be it."" I do believe that the government knows an attack is a galvanizing event, so they have may have done less to prevent one. I don't think they were aware of the WTC details. 

Once you get into the controlled demo conspiracies, you go down a stupid rabbit hole. I have not seen one piece of remotely convincing evidence for this. Not to mention the fact that such a monumental government conspiracy could remain secret so long, especially in the Snowden era. ",1,0,1442027349,1444730134
