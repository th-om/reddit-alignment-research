3mc0h4,In what ways isn't Bernie Sanders the best candidate in 2016?,119,avariciousPUMPKIN,"He's the only candidate who isn't owned by billionaire donors and thus he's the only candidate truly working on behalf of the people. A lot of politicians claim to work for the people but their voting records say otherwise. Bernie's is 100% consistently for the people regardless of what it does for the rich. PolitiFact keeps ranking his statements as ""True"" while most everyone else gets ""Pants on Fire"" or ""False"".

He supports a real living wage. Anyone who works 40 hours a week should have the right to be a home owner, drive a nice car, put food on the table, take vacations, etc. We don't live to work, we work to live. Anyone who works should be allowed to live.

Sanders has done more to advance Civil Rights then any other politician serving in the Senate. He's marched with MLK, sponsored pro-gay rights legislation since the 90's, and was the first politician to openly support trans rights. He understands why women would like to see a woman in office but confidently points to his own record on women's rights issues that is second to none.

He voted against the war. The Bush Administration might have been able to blow smoke up some people's asses (see Hillary) but Bernie was not swayed. He's against war, especially endless war to fund Halliburton and keep the oil companies rich. He's pro peace.

He's the only candidate who has never wavered from his belief on single payer healthcare.

His economic plans will save most tax payers a lot of money while providing a better life, including free healthcare and actual living wages.

He's the only candidate for college students. My tuition is $60,000 a year. Under Bernie it would be completely subsidized by the government. My generation is the future of this nation and saddling us with unreasonable debt while we pursue our dreams is clearly a bad idea. We're one of the only nations in the world that charges for education and that's why we lag so far behind in polls.

Bernie is pro-immigration. He recognizes this country was founded by immigrants and we need to be more accepting and accommodating to modern day immigrants.

I can't believe the GOP is actually making this an issue but Bernie supports science. The magic book might say climate change is a hoax but Bernie knows it's a global crisis and the United States needs to take the lead. He wants to lead by example though. Other candidates want to lead by war.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mc0h4/in_what_ways_isnt_bernie_sanders_the_best/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443187831,1444723992
