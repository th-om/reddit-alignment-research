cvm9xww,1,t3_3na21e,YankeeBlues21,"First off, I wanted to say thanks for taking a chance to get some opinions on opposing views instead of writing off essentially half the country. I'm a registered independent, but I vote Republican way more often than not and identify as somewhere between a conservative and a libertarian. This isn't close to my full philosophy but just some beliefs off the top of my head.

I think that regulations do more harm to commerce than good (and hopefully Uber being chased out of cities will help convince some of my fellow Millennials of that) and I'm a fan of the free market. Capitalism has brought more people out of poverty than any alternative. I like low taxes and think the purpose of taxation is just to keep the gov't functioning, not to reallocate wealth or ensure fair outcomes. At the same time, I'm a practicing Catholic and so obviously hate to see people suffering, but I just don't think government is the solution. Caring for our neighbor is something that falls on each of us individually but shouldn't be coerced through the power of the government. If the gov't wants to facilitate charity by providing incentives to people who run them, that's wonderful. Also, the anti-wealth/success and anti-personal responsibility rhetoric of the Democratic party has gotten to ridiculous levels.  

I believe in a smaller, limited federal government that doesn't make sweeping laws effecting places as wildly different as (for example) California and Alabama. I'm probably a social moderate. I'm good with gay marriage and decriminalizing pot (not a ""fan"" of legalizing, but wouldn't be against it either). I'm pro-life but don't know of any realistic legislation I'd advocate for and abortion is just a political quagmire (neither side will convince the other whether the fetus is or isn't a baby). I'd be okay with a ban at some point (20 weeks is the number thrown around) and no taxes to organizations that provide them. I'm generally exacerbated by the hardline stances the evangelical wing of the party takes, especially when they don't show up for a moderate candidate. 

I'm disenchanted with the party because I feel like both of the major parties are two sides of the same coin. They'll parade their ideals and take stands when they aren't in a position to make a decision, but when they're in office it's the same sort of big government policies and bills filled with extra spending come re-election season.

Did you mean can we see ourselves voting for any of the ""Democrats"" running for President? Cause I feel like it's a bit odd to ask Republicans whether they'd vote for a Republican for president. I can't speak for everyone, but I'd probably vote for any GOP nominee over the Dem alternative (except like probably Webb over Trump). But my preferred candidates are Rubio, Kasich and Rand. (I know that's a broad  spectrum, but I'm not going to agree with anyone on everything so I pick guys I agree with on many things and think would do a decent job). ",20,0,1443829909,1444720126
cvni6qz,0,t1_cvm9xww,Northwest-IPA,"Can I ask a question too? You mention that you believe regulations do more harm than good. Is that literal, or do you mean that some regulations overstep. If it's the later, what kind of regulations would you roll back? Also, do you mostly oppose federal but not state regulations, i.e. Federal EPA but not California EPA?

Thanks if you choose to answer.",2,0,1443934757,1444720129
cvnkr45,0,t1_cvni6qz,YankeeBlues21,"I mean it in broad terms. Obviously thers's a place for some regulations but so many of them just add to the already enormous government bureaucracy. 

For example, (and I touched on this with the Uber reference) I think it's absurd to have laws mandating things like special certifications to cut hair or drive a cab. If someone is running a bad barber shop or cab company or has a bad employee people will stop using their service until they straighten up. And if not, it's a company that deserves to either go under or change ownership. While these may have been established with good intentions, today they really only serve as a high barrier to entry for competitors into these markets. I mean, to use Uber again, they seem to have completely dominated the taxi companies everywhere they operate, because they've had incentive to innovate while cabs were, for decades, the only game in town, and so they became complacent and let their service and utilities decline. Meanwhile, here's Uber replacing a pricey certification system with peer review via social media. Cabbies start out thousands of dollars in the hole after paying for their cab and certification. Cabs never stood a chance...

To give a specific example (and lengthy...sorry, got carried away...) of a regulation I'm not particularly fond of is how expansive the FDA is regarding pharmaceuticals (hear me out for a second). Obviously companies shouldn't just be able to throw garbage in a bottle and call it medicine, but the current process is a major reason why the cost of healthcare has gotten so high in the US. From preclinical trials to becoming available to the market it can take, at best, something like 5 years, and as many as 20, (an average of about 12 years) for a new medication to pass the FDA mandated process. This costs companies hundreds of millions of dollars (avg. $350 mil) during that period. I'm not advocating totally *eliminating* the FDA or anything (or EPA, ""oops..."") but, and I'm spitballing here, wouldn't it be within reason to have a more expedited procedure (say, just to make sure a drug is not doing drastic harm before releasing it on a limited basis to willing patients, like video game beta testing), set up a website (not run by the folks behind healthcare.gov) that keeps data on the efficacy of the medication currently available to the public allowing patients to research which are the best/cheapest/etc and which are covered under which insurance plans, and keep doctors up to date about the most recent developments regarding any potential safety risks (like allergies the prescription may aggravate)? (Holy half-paragraph sentence Batman!) As part of a larger effort to let people take a more active share in ""shopping"" for the best options in care (like having prices of medicine and procedures reported prior to service, except life-threatening situations of course) having a nationally available and popular database of medicine would help reduce the ""failure to warn liability"" which is another part of the regulations that accounts for huge costs to manufacturers. Consumers would be kept up to date on the warnings through the government medical database and be able to make more informed health choices while drug companies wouldn't fear lawsuits as much, allowing them to charge less for their products. Basically what I'm saying in this example is that the FDA's requirements and rules are so costly that pharmaceutical manufacturers are basically forced to pass those costs on to us when we consume the product (often over a decade after it was created, meaning we could have had our hands on a useful medicine years earlier and helped a lot of people that may have been willing to risk side effects if they were given the option as long as the risks were made available to them prior to treatment). As a side note on costs, it certainly doesn't help us that many other countries have weaker patent rights, which is another incentive for drug creators to charge what they can here, while they have sole rights to their creation. So free trade agreements with other countries requiring our patents to be recognized would, I imagine, also be beneficial to our prices of care rather than more protectionist trade policies that risk angering those countries and making them less likely to, among other things, want to acknowledge American drug patents (not to mention the increased incentive to innovate that more globalized patent laws would give to drug makers). 

Now, I went on a bit of a tangent there (healthcare became a bit of an interest of mine a couple years ago) but to answer your specific question, yeah I would probably prefer a state agency to have the primary role in setting standards. If the federal EPA sets something like, say, an emission standard, they may set a specific level of CO2 that people in a state like Oregon think is great (or even too lenient) but is nearly crippling to a state like West Virginia. I mean, in a perfect world we'd be on guaranteed-to-be-safe nuclear (personally, I think nuclear is safe as long as people aren't careless, but nothing in life is certain) tomorrow, but we all know that won't happen. Fossil fuels will probably be the primary energy source for most (if not all) of my life (I'm in my 20s) so we can't try to shift gears immediately. If one state can switch to nuclear and hydro without killing its economy, then wonderful, more power to them! From a worldwide level it's a similar story, the US or UK or wherever can regulate its own consumption, but that isn't in the best interests of a rapidly-developing country like China or India and so it would honestly only handicap American business while not doing much to meet the regulator's environmental goal. Eventually, a private sector entity will develop energy sources for transportation and power that is at least as cheap, efficient, and available as oil or natural gas and that will begin the transition. Until then, environmental standards should be fairly localized, as those governments likely understand their own economies better than an agency in DC. 

I think, when it comes down to it, a lot of people would agree that the bureaucracy has gotten too large and unwieldy and the number of regulations too high, but nothing is done about it because no politician wants to be the guy responsible for laying off a couple hundred government employees cause it'll come back to bite them during election season, nor does he want campaign ads saying he's against things with names like the ""Clean Air"" Act, even if he did so because he would prefer a ""Wyoming"" Clean Air act that's uniquely tailored to his state.",2,0,1443942816,1444720129
cvo11ee,0,t1_cvnkr45,Northwest-IPA,"Thanks for the detailed and well thought out response. You seem to have a more nuanced view of regulations than most people, which I appreciate. I know this is off topic now because nobody is asking, but I'm involved in helping ensure my companies product line is compliant with regulations, and the whole process is very complex and expensive, and has given me a similarly nuanced perspective. 

For my situation, in essence, the government scientists determine through environmental and health studies that airborn particulate matter, for example, need to be reduced because some thousands of lives are estimated be saved due to reduced respitory disease, for example. My knowledge of these studies and the individuals doing the studying gives me personally confidence that their process and conclusions are robust (given there is a disclosed +/- uncertainty), which is besides the point because thats just personal opinion. There's room for disagreement, and there is within the field on the specifics. The gov typically goes with the middle ground consensus of those involved, which again, doesn't make it perfect.

So, the government works with industry to determine cost-effective and feasible ways of reducing the harmful emmision. This is where it gets hairy, because the industry players would like to manufacture a product that is profitable, but there is also a competitive aspect where we could raise prices if our competition were not complaint and thus no longer competing in the market. So, various industry players solicit the regulators to tweak the regulation to give their company a technology or business advantage. For example, if my company has a patent on a certain filter that reduces emission X more than our competition, we will push the EPA to have stringent requirements on emission X that only we can meet. I shit you not. Or if my company is a supplier of material Al, I will push for the goverment to give credits to companies that replace material St with material Al. This actually is in a regulation applicable to my work.

Luckily, the goverment scientists are for the most part smart people and see through most of this bullshit, but its not thanks to us. Even so, bullshit will still get into the regulations because the government really does work closely with the industry, and everyone is pushing to give themselves a leg up and the government makes honest mistakes trusting untrustworthy individuals. From the governments perspective, people die from harmful emmisions and they want it fixed in a cost effective way. But when the industry players use the rule making process to engage in anti-trust behavior, the government can only filter out bullshit by hiring PhDs and technical experts this growing the size of this bureaucracy.

So, I'm not really trying to convince anyone of a certain solution, because I don't have one. Maybe if the government actually enforced anti-trust laws? I don't know.

I would also say that having many local emissions regulations versus a single federal regulation would increase the regulatory burden for small companies. It takes a lot of staff to service the product modularity necessary for supporting multiple emissions standards.

The whole topic is complicated. Our customers would prefer not to have to meet federal regulations, and they increase the cost of the product substantially, really they do. This is probably where the difference between supporting and not supporting the EPA, for example, comes from. The question being, should industry (and consumers in many cases) be FORCED to pay more for the externalities created by their consumption and/or business operations? 

That's also an economic question because certainly a $/life saved metric can be setup, and maybe most people would pay $0.01 extra for gas if it saved a life each time. But what about $1, or $100, or $1000? And how trustworthy is the process? Or might there be another way of meeting the intent of reducing unwanted externalities without strict caps? Or can the compliance process be optimized so that its not so burdensome? It's good stuff to think about.",1,0,1443983950,1444720129

cvmaert,0,t1_cvm9zzz,YankeeBlues21,Anytime. I'm always happy to talk with people I disagree with. We're not going to change each other's mind but not being able to have discussions between people with different opinions is a big reason why there's so much polarization in politics today. It's too easy to just write off the other side as dumb or evil and forget that there's probably a good reason they hold their beliefs. ,3,0,1443830855,1444720137
cvmecfb,1,t3_3na21e,CUDawg30,"For me its a matter of evaluating my personal political ideology with the party that I have the most in common with. I have no shame in telling you and everyone else that I have crossed my party lines to vote for a Democrat that is more in line with my personal views however that seems to happen less often these days due mainly to the fact that the Democratic Party of Alabama just plan sucks. I honestly believe that it is the worst of any of the other 49 states but I digress.  I'm a registered Republican member of the Libertarian wing of the Republican Party. I'm economically liberal (meaning pro-Capitalism as the meaning of liberal and conservative are opposite when talking about economics compared to politics), pro-Constitution, pro-limited Federal government, pro-flat tax rate, pro-balanced budget, pro-military, and pro-strong foreign policy to name a few. That being said I have little respect for the Christian Conservative elements of the Republican Party. I find them to be hypocrites trying to impose their Christian ideology on the United States in clear violation the US Constitution and then claiming for political reason that the Socialist Progressive Democrats are going to do the same thing they are trying to do. To me they are just as bad as the Socialist Progressives from my political point of view however they do have some of the same positions I have such as pro-Capitalism for an example. The major differences I have with the Christian Conservatives is the separation of church and state as I ranted about previously, LBGT rights, and the failed drug policy of the United States, and funding religious schools with taxpayer monies. Then again I'm of the opinion that no taxpayer monies should go to any private school and we should only fund public schools so take that for what it is.

As for who I'm supporting I'm still undecided as far as the Republican primary vote. I have ruled out Donald Trump in the primary. On the Presidential election I have ruled out Bernie Sanders. I like Sanders on a personal level but his politics are not something I like. Clinton is still in play depending on who wins the Republican primary elections as I usually give the Democratic Candidate a chance to convince me they deserve my vote. I did vote for Obama once. My fault not his I say. In my mind what is best for the United States trumps party loyalty. Same is true of the State over party loyalty. 

On perspective it really depends on where your at. A lot of the comments I see coming from the Socialist Progressives seem so unfathomable to me. A lot of their views seem to be full of hypocrisy. Like they say they are for the people but then turn around and attack the people's branch of the Federal government in Congress favoring an Imperial Presidency and a larger Federal government. I don't understand that. I hear shouts of scrapping the Constitution and in the same conversation I hear cries of the Federal government violating privacy rights. I don't get it. They call for the equality treatment of everyone but then turn around and basically call for class warfare. How can you say your for equality and then call for unfair treatment of another group. I just don't get it. This seems counter productive to equality in the eyes of the Federal government to me. Don't get me wrong I respect their opinion and I try to to keep an open mind about things because I don't have all the answers. It just irritates me that they can have these views that seem to me that are full of contradictions. I'm not even going to get into the downing of the United States while idealizing European nations which really rubs me the wrong way. 

If I offended anyone I apologize because that wasn't my intention. Thank you for asking the question you did in the way you did. Very respectful. I wish a lot more people would do that to keep things civil between us. We can have political disagreements but it doesn't have to evolve into hate between us. At the end of the day we are all citizens of the United States of America. To me differing political ideologies is good for a democracy. We just can't forget that we all are trying to do what is best for the country in our own way. We can't fear compromises because there will never be a time when we all agree to the same things.

As for why, I'm familiar with some arguments which vary depending on an individuals level of cynicism. 1)  humanist aspirations like spreading freedom, 2) keeping Americans safe, or 3) war is justified on the basis of economic benefits such as oil trade, military manufacturing jobs, or ensuring hegemony of the US dollar in world trade.

cvnk14c,0,t1_cvniuzv,CUDawg30,"I'll be honest I have absolutely no problem with the United States spreading its enlightenment revolutionary philosophy abroad. I do not advocate the US to invade another nation for that reason alone but when we have to go to war I really want the end result for the people of the invaded nation to benefit in some way. Our freedoms is something that I wish that all people have around the world. 

There are a few things that in my mind are clear reasons to go to war. 1. To defend every allied nation from foreign aggression. 2. To stop a genocide. 3. To stop a nation from using chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. 4. To eliminate any nation from sponsoring international terrorism. 5. To protect democratic nations from dictatorships and military coups. As for the economic side of things it would have to be something very extreme for me to justify an invasion. The oil trade is the only thing I can really think that could even impact that. It would still have to be something like Iran blockading the Persian Gulf oil supply to the world for a real justification.

As for if I would have went into Iraq I will not lie I would have however I would have invaded when Saddam gassed the Kurds not because of a fear of a weapon of mass destruction after 9/11. To me a nation like the United States has a obligation to defend the defenseless in these cases. Its is for that reason alone that I was for the Iraq War and I do not apologize for that backing.

I'm a big believer in the freedom of the press however I have no problem with criticizing the way they go about their job. 

As far as the left and right being able to work together in politics Clinton and a Republican controlled Congress were able to work together. With them working together they were able to have the first federal budget surpluses since 1969. They worked together to dramatically increased federal funding for HIV/AIDS prevention-research-treatment. They worked together to improve the effectiveness of the social safety net, including an increase in the number of child care places, a significant expansion of the EITC program, and the introduction of new programs such as SCHIP and a child tax credit. The two parties passed the Hope Scholarship tax credit and the Lifetime Learning tax credit. Federal funding for scientific research was boosted, with funding for the National Science Foundation increased by more than 30%. The GEAR UP college preparation program was funded by them. They increased the National Institutes of Health funding by 40%. They passes the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Republicans and Democrats can work together in positive ways if we have a leader that is willing to put the good of the country above politics as Bill Clinton was able to do.

cvmebkd,0,t1_cvme2ad,TheNaBr,"Cruz's face isn't handsome, that's his major problem.  He'll talk with people and treat them respectfully though.

He stays on message and doesn't get sidetracked.  I don't know what comes off as sleazy, you'll have to elaborate.

As for his religious leanings, they don't bother me at all. I'm not a self identified Christian myself and I'm fine with people expressing their faith.  I think he's right that to get elected, you need to turn out that voter base, which is one of the reasons Carson has risen in the polls.  I don't think that because he's religious it'll mean a strict religious push in the USA.  I haven't exactly been supportive of the current push to extract all religion from government.

No he isn't.  He gets people to agree with him, that's how he got the House to cause the government shut down.  The problem currently is that he's fighting both the establishment GOP and the Democrats at the same time.

Served as Texas Solicitor General.  Argued law in front of the Supreme Court.  

Served as a clerk under the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and was the first Hispanic clerk for a Chief Justice of the United States.

>An actual thing he's gotten entered into law or changed, not some BS 'principled stand.'

If you want to limit the role to things only done in the senate, then he got Senate bill 2195 passed.  Though you don't think principled stands count, I would certainly also chalk shutting the government down up as an accomplishment.

>He has alienated his own caucus in the Senate. 

He can alienate establishment GOP members, I don't care.  They're getting run out of office and are part of the problem.

>He has no allies who have an iota of influence, 

He has allies in Mike Lee and also had allies in the House to accomplish the 2013 shut down.  That shows influence.
