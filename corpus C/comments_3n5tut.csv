No.  Collateral damage isn't terrorism.  Collateral damage is (not surprisingly) collateral damage.  Why are you asking me this anyway?  The Fourth Geneva convention spells it all out.  

>If instead as you say (in your second post) that it is the tactics employed which define an act of terror as well as the intended target are not the Free Syrian Army no different than ISIL?

Because I read nothing that said FSA targets civilians.  The article talked about attacking military targets which is obviously not terrorism.

You imply that you are law enforcement, and that is fine.  The definition you provide is pretty much what I learned in the military back in the 80's and my son says that he was pretty much taught the same thing in the marines in the 2000's.  However, my comments are regarding actual practice in the US in recent years.  Perhaps your department is different, but I know that many areas around the country are not using such a definition in their actual practices.

I have had a burr up my butt since I first learned of such things back in the late 70's.  Swat and Hawaii 5 O were big hits at the time.  Much of what ran on these shows offended me, but I figured most of it was just theatre.  As a teen and later, I learned that swat teams were being formed in every city for damn near no reason.  I also learned of search and seizure (sp?) practices that I found abominable.  Then about how they can take property, even that which is not owned by the presumed offender, at the time of arrest - without waiting for conviction or assignment of costs and such.

So I keep my ears to the ground on these matters.  I will avoid examples that are vague 'I heard' stories and use Vista California as an example (at the time I lived and worked near by).  There had been ""riots"" over a period of 3 days in north-east Vista.  IMO the riots were almost laughable, but that's not the point.  However a bunch of military-like equipment showed up and maintained a perimeter of control for 2 days in the area (blocking normal route home).  Afterward, they used video, pictures and so on to identify 'potential provocateurs' and 'responsible parties'.   They had to choose justifications for searches premises and convincing friends and family to rat them out.

To shorten it up, they used 'civil disorder' for some, 'gang activity' and 'terrorism' where ever they needed to play the system to their interest.  The courts let it play out and when it went to prosecuting the defendants they used totally different terms and arguments.  The press had a field day, but the courts and juries played like idiots and let it go even when presented in court.

That combined with the last decade of pushing military hardware into local municipalities under the terms 'national security' and 'terrorism' freely and liberally ... even where there is absolutely no reason to use such terms.

cvldodl,1,t3_3n5tut,xiipaoc,"""Terrorism"" is basically non-state warfare against civilians.  Instead of fighting against armies who are trying to kill you, you fight against people who are just going about their day, where the goal is to actually hurt them.  But really, whoever is defining terrorism is probably defining it so that *their* actions are exempt, but anyway.

So when someone bombs a crowded market, let's say (suicide or otherwise), why is he (or she) doing it?  Is it as part of a war against someone?  Or is it some other reason?  I think it would be wrong to say that the Columbine shootings were terrorism, for example.  The shooters were trying to kill the people who (in their mind) hurt them, in general; the motive was personal.  On the other hand, 9/11 *was* absolutely terrorism, since the blow was against the entire West, not against the specific people -- the people had nothing to do with this whatsoever.  9/11 was about making Americans feel unsafe by murdering thousands of us.  Compare, say, the Nazis.  They weren't exactly terrorists -- their goal wasn't non-state warfare; it was actually eliminating the Jewish people and other ""undesirables"".  ISIS today is quite similar to the Nazis; they're not really terrorists.  They're actually trying to eliminate the people they don't like via genocide (see: Yazidis, Muslims who are not in their sect of Islam, Christians, etc.).  Terrorism is meant to threaten the comfortable.  Genocide is something else.

I think that we need to remove some of the stigmas associated with the term ""terrorism"" and see it for what it is: a despicable warfare tactic focused on civilians in general.
