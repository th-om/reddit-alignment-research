3lty3f,"Bernie fans, does it bother you that Sanders is anti-free trade, anti-nuclear power, anti-GMO, and anti-gun?",469,hlpe,"Some positions are a matter of opinion. But on some issues there's a strong scientific consensus. Like evolution and free-trade.

Its not just TTIP that Bernie opposes, but virtually every free trade agreement and organization. Almost every credible economist disagrees with Sanders here.

All gun control isn't necessarily stupid, but an assault weapons ban is. And Bernie has always supported it. 

Bernie also goes along with the ignorant hysteria about GMOs. And I think he's taken a bad position on nuclear power. ",34,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lty3f/bernie_fans_does_it_bother_you_that_sanders_is/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442857910,1444725762
