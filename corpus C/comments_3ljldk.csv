I would argue this is exactly why the Presidency needs to be eliminated. It is a job *designed* to be done well by an insider. So my frame of reference is a little different here.

>In fact Jeb Bush is probably more liberal on that position than other members. You can't cite an opinion much of the party agrees upon and use that to show total adherence to his family. 

Most of the party does not agree on this issue. They may be in favor of slight liberalizations of the laws due to recent political pressure, but Rand Paul is the only one who is actually talking about the real problem with any kind of seriousness. It's one thing to be pushed by political pressure into mildly supporting something. It is an entirely different thing to actually address the core problem with any substance. What is happening to people because of the current drugs laws is one of the worst man-made disasters that exists right now - especially when focusing particularly on first-world problems.

>""Kept us safe.""

There is a lot behind this phrase. You can't just easily brush it aside. First, it means Jeb is dense enough to ignore the fact that the worst domestic terrorist attack in our history occured under his brother's ""leadership"". Now, I wouldn't actually want to try and boil blame for such a thing down to the President, but these politicians always try and get credit for this stuff, so it is at least worth pointing out the hypocrisy there.

But beyond that, it means Jeb has bought into this entire ""War on Terror"" nonsense. He's bought into this notion that something that kills a ridiculously small fraction of our population should be presented as one of the greatest threats we face. Did a huge number of people change their diet and activity levels under George Bush's presidency? Because that is something that would have actually made a significant difference with respect to the things that cause death and despair in our lives. Did we even avoid any more terrorist attacks? No. There were still terrorist attacks during Bush's presidency. In that one sentence, Jeb makes it clear that he is living in an almost total fantasy land where priorities are drastically distorted based on emotion and intuition rather than clear-headed thinking about what would really make a difference.

>What if Jeb did not have the last name Bush, and everything else is the same? What then?

Then it would be a slightly better situation. Because it would have meant he was more likely to have had to actually achieve the status needed to attract the kind of powerful support you need to run for President. Of course, it would still be far from ideal, because we know people have to do all kinds of slimy crap to get to that position, but at least it won't be just because he raised his hand at the dinner table and said, ""Daddy!

I would argue that is the constituency of the far left. And Rand Paul is definitely not far left. The reason a lot of people on the left don't like politicians like him is because he is strongly in favor of the free market and individual responsibility, and many on the left consider those things to be inherantly unfair.

This is going to sound a bit unfair, but I think Rand panders to the highly-informed.

>Bill Clinton, for all the of the right wing revisionism and false scandal, had a way of redefining the terms of issues without the vitriol, and trying to appeal to something more common.

I have to admit Clinton is one of my least favorite politicians. What you consider to be a reasonable ""reaching across the aisle"" approach is what others saw as the most cynical political strategist the world has seen for a long time. During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Donna Shalala, one of Clinton's cabinet members, confronted him during a meeting. After listening to Clinton explain that he was going to have to admit to some of the things he lied about, she said it was starting to look like the President didn't really care about anything other than protecting himself. She told him that she thought it was really nasty that he felt he had no obligation to be a role model.

""I can’t believe that is what you’re telling us, that is what you believe, that you don’t have an obligation to provide moral leadership. I don’t care about the lying, but I’m appalled at the behavior.’""

At this point, Clinton turned to her and told her that if her logic had prevailed we would have had Nixon instead of Kennedy. That seemed to shut her up.
