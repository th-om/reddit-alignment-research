> She wants to increase an already bloated military budget and is very hawkish

It's difficult to just call our military budget bloated.  Sure you can compare it to everyone else, but that's totally apples to oranges.  Fact is, we do need to maintain global hegemony, and we do need to confront Russia to return to a peaceful status quo.  Does that mean carpet bombing Syria?  Probably not, but remember that all of the candidates on stage are pandering to likely republican voters.  Fiorina displayed good fluency with foreign policy issues, second to Rand Paul and Rubio (iirc, Paul was the most pragmatic - said what should and would be done, Rubio was the first to highlight the realities of the situation, and Fiorina was the best at describing a desirable sounding policy in detail whether or not she would actually go through with it).

> She made up stuff about planned parenthood videos, and can put a good emotional response of indignation when she needs to.

Yeah this shit irritates me too.  The PP videos are deliberately misleading, no need to lie about them even more.  Still, pandering to the audience is more important than honesty in politics.


> She can actually land a punch on Trump due to the social protection of being a women, notice how the audience clapped along when Trump made fun of Rand's looks 10 minutes earlier but thought her response was brilliant.

Entertainment?  And trump said some pretty nasty shit about her, the response was very good [I think we all heard trump clearly] because on the surface it is very civil but it highlights how disrespectful trump was to her.  Trump was making rude comments to everyone, it's part of his brand to be a brash loudmouth.

> Completely forgettable on taxes and immigration.

Yeah fair.

> Has a very low likability in terms of mannerisms and demeanor, I can actually see what Trump mean't.

I think she's alright, I mean she comes off as a little stern but seems well informed.

> Pandering response about the currency question, because women aren't a special interest group, they can't be on the bill?

Who cares bout the bill?

> Lied blatantly about her business record.

Who cares about her business record?  What did she lie about?  I'm sure there's multiple interpretations to the story.

Annnnyways, I took biggest umbrage at her parading her Alcoholic Pill-addicted daughters death as an anti-Marijuana anecdote, pretty disgusting (just like  the way PP is discussed).  Any reasonable person looking at plain facts would agree that marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol and has less social impact than alcohol, but the GOP still parades this nonsense about gateway drugs around.  I would probably vote GOP if not for that issue...

I'm a little skewed because I really strongly believe that the entire drug scheduling act should disappear.  State regulations and some federal legislation against some of the more deadly drugs (heroin) should take it's place. Legitimate addiction should be treated (just like it is for alcohol, gambling, tobacco and whatever else), but throwing people in jail for taking drugs is dumb, and used in practice as the primary mechanism to perpetuate racial injustice.",2,0,1442518083,1444727353

Come on, it's not apples to apples but do you think we need MORE spending? Don't we already spend more then the next 10 combined? If we get in a large scale war with any superpower it'll be nuclear winter anyways, wars between countries are fought with economics nowadays not bullets.

Yeah, I liked seeing Trump shut down, I just hate that the only reason she was able to do it because people feel sorry for women that called ugly and not men. She had made fun of Trump's appearance first, and everyone feels sorry for her when he hits back. Trump insulted Rand for no reason and everyone's clapping along.

Obviously, you haven't watched it.  Why?  Because the video is over 10 minutes long and obviously shows more than ""nothing except"" an aborted fetus moving.  It also includes the commentary Fiorina gave, and what she described shows up exactly.  

Like I said, you can debate the authenticity of the video.  I'm not an abortion or anti-abortion activist and have no interest in whether or not the video is authentic or everything it claims to be.  I only pointed out that the fact check was **flat wrong**.  The video does, in fact, exist and matches clearly the description given by Fiorina at the debate.  Instead of fact checking that, websites have concerned themselves with whether or not the video is authentic.  But, here's the thing.  It doesn't matter.  A fact check is a fact check.  Fiorina said this video exists and described it.  It does.  If the video isn't authentic, that's on the makers of the video, not Fiorina, yet, you and others seem intent on assigning blame to her for merely making mention of it rather than the filmmakers for not making it honestly.

You got me here, I do have problems with the video. The Center for Medical Progress is an anti-abortion organization with an obvious bias. How do I know that this woman didn't just make things up?

While I am pro-choice I do oppose late-term and partial birth abortions, which, I assume is where the fetus in question comes from. That said if the mothers life is in danger I would support this type of procedure. This video gives zero reference on what the circumstances around this abortion were. If the mother's life was in danger I have no problem with tissue being used for research. I am an organ donor and if my organs are not usable when I die I would want my body to be used for whatever research they could do with it.

Now before you roll your eyes and say Fuckn_hipsters is an asshole like I thought he was lets think about what your reaction would be if I sourced something from the Center for American Progress.

And, as for the business record, you can read **OP's own source!**  Seriously, read it and pay close attention to **how** the writer arrives at the conclusion that Fiorina is lying.  He actually got numbers from one of Fiorina's PACs that showed precisely what she was claiming.  But, he chose, arbitrarily (admittedly at one point), to reject the metrics those numbers were based on and pick different dates and times and measurements.  So, Fiorina has one set of measurements she quotes, accurately so, and the fact checker says ""Mmmmm.... nah.  I want to use a different set of numbers you haven't referred to or ever got asked about or had a chance to respond to.  I'm going to use those numbers instead and say you're lying.""

And you can't Google it?

Okay, we'll start with a good article describing why a lot of this information [is entirely subjective](http://theweek.com/articles/572482/carly-fiorina-really-bad-ceo).

Now, we'll look at a [positive analysis of her record.](http://fusion.net/story/198712/did-carly-fiorina-really-do-a-bad-job-as-ceo/).  

It's also important to note that Fiorina's predecessors and successors were notably less successful at managing the company than she was and that much of the criticism originates from Dell and HP's embedded legacy employees.  

Just for good measure, [here is another fair and objective analysis with commentary from various parties involved with Fiorina during her tenure at HP.  Be sure and read all three pages.](http://news.investors.com/technology/082715-768408-assessing-fiorinas-time-as-hp-chief.htm?ven=djcp&src=aurlabo&p=2%20-#http%3a%2f%2fnews.investors.com%2fNewsAndAnalysis%2fArticle.aspx%3fid%3d768408%26ven%3ddjcp%26src%3daurlabo%26p%3d2).

This is what kills me.  You took all that time to type up your little critique of me... yet you couldn't at any point Google ""Fiorina CEO record""?  This is what makes the whole ""SOURCE!!!"" thing so ludicrous.  It gets down to selective laziness.  Personally, I feel like an OP should post their sources from the get go.  But, they don't.  Instead, they just say whatever they want while anyone disagreeing is pounced on for sources by people who can opine for paragraphs without ever searching the three little words that would find them all the information they could ask for.  It's among the most ridiculous things on the Internet, Reddit especially.",1,0,1442637177,1444727356

Donald Trump does not have a history of making men angry by making misandrist comments. Fiorina's response worked because it was a clear but subtle nod to all the other misogynist comments he's made in the spotlight. And being a woman, it's realistic to expect she has at least some insight into how those misogynist comments have been received by other women, which she wouldn't have if she were a man.
