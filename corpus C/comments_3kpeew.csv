Either he really believes the borderline insane things I've [seen him say](http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/12/dr-ben-carson-america-very-much-like-nazi-germany-video/), or he's being intentionally inflammatory because he thinks it will get him votes.

Both of those options make me lose a lot of respect for the guy.",1,0,1442204400,1444729751

cv0vcq2,0,t1_cv0tm95,evanb_,"Bobby was generally seen as vulgar, manipulative, and emotionally abusive in his personal and professional life. An excellent politician (whom I personally admire) in the vein of LBJ, but not a great person outside of his speeches. It took that sort of person to really bore out the Teamsters, but he didn't win any friends doing it. He was as dirty as they come.

I recommend the book ""1960: LBJ vs. JFK vs. Nixon"" for a look at how a younger Bobby worked the JFK campaign and his time working for anti-communist Joe McCarthy.",1,0,1442207819,1444729755

american politics is a system that largely selects for people that are good at seeming genuine while being interviewed. Believing that it makes him actually genuine is no different than believing that magicians are actually magical, or that action stars are actually heroic badasses. ",-1,0,1442119631,1444729755
