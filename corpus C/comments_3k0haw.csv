It was managed by Clinton staffers with limited IT expertise or security clearance until 2013,[6] after which she contracted Platte River Networks, a technology services company, to begin managing her server and to maintain it at a private data center in New Jersey.

The Clinton's personally paid a State Department staffer, Bryan Pagliano, who had previously served as IT director for Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, to maintain the private e-mail server while Clinton was Secretary of State.[12][13] According to a Clinton campaign official in September 2015, this ensured that taxpayer dollars would not be spent on a private server that was shared by Clinton, her husband and their daughter, as well as several aides to the former president.[12] Pagliano’s private employment by the Clintons while also an employee of the Department of State was also confirmed to the Washington Post by a campaign official.""
