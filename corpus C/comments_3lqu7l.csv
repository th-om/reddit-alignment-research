The problem with the Citizens United ruling is that it makes perfect sense within our principles of free speech and free press. The logic behind super PACs is solid. 

The real root of the problem is based in what Habermas and many others call ""advanced capitalism."" This is capitalism after industrialization, which allowed capital owners to begin exploiting workers for massive profits and widening out the wage gap. The liberalizing capitalism that we all learn about in history classes and that political talking heads glorify is the version of capitalism that existed before industrialization.

To address the cause of the problem, we need to balance the economy and reduce the wage gap. As money redistributes, power and access to public means of communication will also redistribute.

There is one other option that I can think of. It is kind of a work-around: at some point the Supreme Court could recognize that, while the logic of the Citizens United ruling was solid, it led to dire consequences and massive corruption. After making that realization, the Supreme Court could overturn it's previous ruling and create a new set of standards surrounding limits on private political propaganda (propaganda's definition would need to be worked out) spending. This would be an especially reasonable ruling considering that the economy is beginning to eclipse the state in terms of size and power (power here referring to control of privately owned public spaces like many sidewalks, plazas and shopping malls, power as dictated through private contracts and the ability to regulate where and how resources are allocated).

I don't see how that solves the problem of candidates needing a lot of money to campaign to a national audience.  They're still going to need that money.  Actually, it would seem to exacerbate the problem, because now you have even more constituents who want to spend money getting their message out, driving up the cost.

The best way to get money out of politics is to reduce the cost of campaigning.  There are a lot of ways to do that, but it truly is difficult to do so without limiting speech.

The best way, I think, is to find some way to limit the length of the campaign season.  The easy way to do this is to say, ""Ok, no campaigning until one month before the Presidential election.""  But that would require hindering speech.

The UK has a very short campaign season, and the reason is because Parliamentary sessions are unpredictable (or at least they used to be).  Maybe we should just switch to a Parliamentary system, where a vote of no confidence can happen at any time, triggering a one month election season.

cv96s4w,1,t3_3lqu7l,MemeticParadigm,"IMO, a big part of the problem is not just the amount of money, but the ability to dump all that money into mouthpieces **that lack a persistent reputation**.

One issue that's always brought up is that, even if we limit how much individuals can spend, there will always be people (talk show hosts, pundits, anchors, famous people, etc.) who can project whatever message they choose to a huge audience, compared to your typical American, and I think that's a valid issue to raise - but we *certainly* can't tell those people they can't talk about anything political. So I think, if Bill O'Reilly, or Bill Maher, or Walmart, or any other entity with a persistent reputation/history wants to publicly endorse a candidate, that's fine, and I see no problem with them spending as much money or airtime or w/e resource they possess as they want, telling you why they endorse that candidate, and why you should too.

It's fine *because* those endorsements come with a meaningful context - the reputation of the endorser, which means you can identify potential conflicts of interest, ulterior motives, a history of deception, etc. - all the things which tell you when to be wary about accepting the arguments being made in the endorsement at face value.

The problem is when the Koch brothers can spend half a billion dollars pushing an agenda that benefits them personally, without the viewer ever being able to identify that the real context of the message is actually the Koch's advocating on their own behalf, because that half a billion dollars translates into 10 different entities with names like ""Citizens United"" and ""Americans for Freedom"", who have no previous reputation and don't have to worry about future reputation, being an endorsement mouthpiece for the Koch's, *while trying to give the appearance that they are really advocating on behalf of the average American*.

My answer to your question, then, is that **spending on political speech, beyond some annual limit, should not be permitted in an effectively anonymous fashion**. If you spend more than X$ per year on political advocacy, every bit of media produced with that money needs to end or begin with ""Paid for by [Walmart/Koch Industries/David Soros/etc.]"" so that people actually know, by default, which entities are amplifying which political advocacy, and are then empowered to judge that advocacy within its true context.

I think this could do a lot to mitigate the damage caused by money in politics, without actually having to place hard limits on expenditures that can reasonably be classified as an expression of free speech. In theory, I think it would even help mitigate the negative effects of massive money in lobbying, as the money of donors with a negative public perception would essentially become ""tainted"" in that you wouldn't want to be forced to associate them with your brand in the next election, so such donors would effectively be stuck at the limit as far as promising campaign/PAC contributions when lobbying congresspeople.",3,0,1442855455,1444726258

More generally, if 50% of a PAC's funding came from 1 donor, that donor would be attributed with 100% credit on 50% of the ads run by that PAC, or 50% of the credit on 100% of ads run, but no more than 3 donors would be credited with any single run of an ad, so as not to dilute the association/responsibility for the ad.",1,0,1442925015,1444726258

But you're right to a degree, money in elections tend to favor the front runner, because people want to donate to the winning horse. But the actual effect tends to be how it effects voting behavior. 

The data does support voting behavior based off where people are getting money from. One of the issues is pretty fundamental: We elect representatives to make informed decisions on our behalf. We recognize that we just don't have the time in our day, nor intellectual capacity, to keep up on ALL political decisions being made. So we essentially ""hire"" someone to do it full time on our behalf.

This is where the problem starts. Let's say, for instance, a new bill is coming up involving extremely complicated financial deregulation. This bill, objectively, is just going to help financial institutions make more money, but hurt society slightly at large. However, this is an extremely complicated bill, so the average person 1) doesn't understand it and 2) doesn't care to try and understand it.

Now, your rep also is getting large sums of contributions both financially and socially. The finance industry is contributing large sums to his campaign, but also opening their powerful network, which further helps the politician get more funding. This is something the politician wants. Not only does receiving this funding help their career, but if they lose this funding, it will go to a competitor running against them.

So the politician now has a very large incentive to vote in favor of the financial industry, even though the new regulations are objectively worse for the people he represents. Due to the understandable lack of education by his voters on the subject, the rep can vote either way, and it'll have zero impact on his approval rating. So logically, the rational move to make is to vote in favor of the large donors to secure the funding, and keep competition mitigated. 

This is how it works across the board and TONS of issues. The financial aspect gives very bad incentives to politicians who we really on to act in good faith. 

Now, to top it off, there is a common trend of direct bribery that happens via a loophole. Now they wont just give a politician 5 million dollars for a vote. But instead, they'll promise them a 5 year ""consulting contract"" once they retire, at 1 million a year.

Can you see how these incentives can erode our democracy?

And I get it's a free speech issue, but we limit speech all the time in the name of safety and justice. For instance, you can't practice your speech on a highway by marching down it during rush hour. And even judges, we recognize that even though they are really good people, financial incentives could cloud their judgement, which is why we prevent them from hearing cases in which they have financial connections with. Heck, we even limit how much money we can donate to a candidate (before the loophole was discovered) because we recognize that large donors can use money to get an unfair advantage with their ""speech"" which could incentivize the politician to act in bad faith.

Candidates would live stream a discussion not just with own base but interact with everyone. There could be a moderator. 

Candidates would debate another candidate one on one with a moderator. Votes could be tallied based on the response per topic, not just the total votes of the debate, people can ask the candidates questions, and follow up. 

The idea is to get the debates away from the networks of Fox and CNN, its not up to them to filter who will be on that stage. Using Youtube the candidates can debate anywhere, offer presentations, provide source material, and allow for more debates because they are not conflicting with Fox and CNN other broadcasts.

I know not everyone on Youtube is not civil the same as Reddit. I want some people who are completely clueless to ask questions. Because hopefully they will be corrected by other users or the candidates themselves. 

I want to end the single candidate stump speech because its more of a show, then an actual presentation of candidates view points of the issues. I rather see more give an take between the candidate and the voters and you can't have discussion at a speech.

cv8rl0t,0,t1_cv8jbbl,zDougie,"I find the court's ruling sensible but the argument in the majority opinion to be abominable.  Yet that is not at discussion here.  

What I like about how the ruling is termed and summarized is that it equates the ability to spend money with free speech.  Lets pretend for a moment that this was true.  Our nation started with only male land owners having say.  I don't know the arguments that started the trail to letting everyone, everywhere vote ... but surely equating money with speech returns us to the same problems as land owners.

Why do I think this?  Free speech / Expression [these are equated not entirely but expression is a necessary component of speech and thought] is roughly equal for all people.  There is some variation based on gender, health and wealth (in the sense that only the rich can spend long periods speaking or yelling), but by and large every human is reasonably equal in potential.

However if money is speech, then billionaires are able to speak with a voice and manner that makes only their speech audible.  If two people were in a park and one had amplifiers and transmitters but the other had a damaged larynx alone - who would consider these to be 'equal'?

IMO money is expression.  Everyone should be allowed to speak and think as they wish, and free expression is intrinsic to such freedom.  However expression alone has no business in our innate human rights.  Thus a reasonable amount of expression via money must be allowed, but to pretend that people on welfare are 'equal' and then talking about money as free speech is lunacy.",5,0,1442814533,1444726289

Huh? The problem with that is that people who were not white male landowners had literally no power to choose who represented them, they couldn't even vote. If you think not being able to make electioneering communications because you can't afford to is the same as being legally barred from voting, I can't help you.

>However if money is speech, then billionaires are able to speak with a voice and manner that makes only their speech audible.

This is not the case. Indeed, the point of things like PAC's is allowing lots of little guys who would otherwise not be able to afford to buy ads to do so.

>If two people were in a park and one had amplifiers and transmitters but the other had a damaged larynx alone - who would consider these to be 'equal'?

Not in terms of ability to get their message heard...but so what? The right they are equal with respect to is a lack of government interference in their speech, and in this sense they are equal. Stephen Colbert has a much better ability to get his political message heard than you or I do, is this somehow unfair or unjust? Does it require correction by government?

>Thus a reasonable amount of expression via money must be allowed, but to pretend that people on welfare are 'equal' and then talking about money as free speech is lunacy.

People are equal with respect to the rights they are allowed to exercise, the rich and poor alike are free from government restrictions on their political speech except in some very narrow cases. No one is arguing they have equal ability to get their message out, but that's not what the right to free speech is about.",1,0,1442846575,1444726289
cv95jn1,0,t1_cv918ie,zDougie,"Originally, the founders seemed to have felt that the main thing that needed redress was taxation without representation.  I'm pretty sure that is why we started with white male land owners.

Regarding your other points, I keep seeing them ... but I'm baffled at how people think your points are sensible.  I WANT to understand - I believe that if I can't argue for your points then I clearly don't understand them.

When freedom of speech, religion and press originated in the US, the first item of contention was how and when could such rights be forfeit.  For example, anyone could write their thoughts on a slip of paper and pass it to someone else.  However the rich were able to use print and news paper type processes to express their thoughts.  On this example, most states implemented rules that required news outlets to give reasonable access to everyone in the community.

Similar examples for religion and speech.  If I believe god is sending a meteor to strike your building at precisely 13:20 local time today, do I have the right to stand at the doors and access points yelling and screaming that you need to get out of the building by then?  When and how should I be impeded from such behavior?

The goal has never been to limit the rich's power, but rather to ensure reasonable access to everyone.  Do you think that news outlets should be allowed to only let billionaires write articles or air their opinions?  If no rules are in place, then that is exactly what will happen due to scarcity of resources.

Once upon a time, a company operated in a city, in a community.  Sometimes they were scrupulous, but the local people always had the power to affect change through local ballots if they really wanted to.  Today, companies operate in nebulous clouds - almost completely immune to the effects of their decisions upon local communities.  Yet we are giving them freedom of religious expression and freedom to fund politicians with [effectively] no limits?

Could you take your thoughts of speech using green ink that can correlate to circumstances in early US history for comparison?

cv99ieg,0,t1_cv95jn1,Hailanathema,">On this example, most states implemented rules that required news outlets to give reasonable access to everyone in the community.

So, the reason states were able to make these laws early in the republic is probably because the first amendment wasn't [incorporated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights) against the states until the ~1920's. Also, what does ""reasonable access to the community"" mean?

>Similar examples for religion and speech.

But this example has nothing to do with religion. If I wanted to impede traffic and quack like a duck, that would be exactly the same as your above scenario. The religious component is irrelevant. All this demonstrates is that time, place, and manner restrictions are sometimes constitutional, but limiting someone's speech based on how much money they have is almost certainly not.

>The goal has never been to limit the rich's power, but rather to ensure reasonable access to everyone.

If this is the case, shouldn't the government be doing something like put price caps on advertisements so that even less wealthy people can afford it? And again, what qualifies as ""reasonable access""? I take reasonable access to mean that people are not legally forbidden from doing it, at least in this context.

>Do you think that news outlets should be allowed to only let billionaires write articles or air their opinions? If no rules are in place, then that is exactly what will happen due to scarcity of resources.

Huh? There are currently no laws restricting who may or may not write an op-ed for a newspaper...but we don't see only billionaires writing op-eds. The effects you prophesy here have already failed to come to pass in exactly the situation you claim they would come to pass in.

>Yet we are giving them freedom of religious expression and freedom to fund politicians with [effectively] no limits?

We are giving the *people* that own/operate/work for these companies freedom of religious expression and freedom to contribute to political causes they care about. There are currently caps on how much you can give to a candidate directly, just not how much you can give to other political issue groups, groups which are forbidden from coordinating with candidates.

>Could you take your thoughts of speech using green ink that can correlate to circumstances in early US history for comparison?

This isn't really possible. There weren't even legal caps on how much money you could give to candidates at the federal level until  [1907](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillman_Act_of_1907). This seems to indicate the founders didn't think people giving money to candidates, even unlimited amounts, was a big deal.
