cv3hwx9,1,t3_3l60e3,NewWahoo,"Disclaimer: I'm a *huge* Webb supporter

Chaffee is an obvious nonfactor. He became a Democrat literally months ago. He's from the Rhode Island (where's that?) and has spent his political career taking middle of the road positions which don't appeal to anyone who votes in the Democratic Primary.

O'Malley's problem is a little different. He is to the left of Clinton on everything, so you'd think he'd pick up some of the anti Clinton sentiment. All the support he could have had was soaked up by Sanders. Sanders was viewed as very much separate from the ""machine"" or party establishment, while O'Malley is very much involved. Also, he left his term as a pretty unpopular governor. His hand picked successor blew a race in Maryland (I can still barely believe it).",5,0,1442413567,1444727946

cv3tg40,1,t3_3l60e3,jelvinjs7,"I find this whole situation pretty odd: the Republicans have a gigantic field and are scrambling to pick one, while the Democrats have placed all their eggs in one basket, with the others clamoring to get into the omelet. It looks like the Democrats have 1-1.5 candidates, when they really have 5, and they are some interesting characters. O'Malley has been a councilman, mayor, and governor; Chafee has been a mayor, governor, and senator; and Webb has been a senator and Secretary of the Navy. I have limited knowledge of the candidates beyond that (working on amending that), but it seems that there's a good mix of backgrounds that would make for great debates. Unfortunately, the DNC is only hosting 6, and these guys are getting no attention, so their input doesn't enter the national discussion as much.
