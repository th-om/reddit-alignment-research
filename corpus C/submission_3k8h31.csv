3k8h31,"People seek out incredibly aggressive and violent entertainment, compared to the old days. I don't know if this is a problem, but I think it might make sense of the zeitgeist.",47,littlebitsoffluff,"First of all, let me say that I have enjoyed violent, aggressive, and often morally bankrupt entertainment as much as anyone, in my day. Relatively recently, after decades of such, I have become a little tired of it actually, which is what prompts this post. I find myself trying to find more gentle ways of passing time.

Also, I am not trying to be a moralist, not expecting anything to change, or even wishing it to change. I am just making an observation that's probably pretty obvious to anyone thinking on the matter. But it confuses me a bit. 

I was born in 1961 in the U.S. As such, I entered a time that was still heavily redolent of the 1950s. Now, I am not saying that society was LESS violent then--that would not be true. I think I read somewhere that we are at a decades-long low point for violent crime in the U.S., murders being down, etc. etc.

But popular ENTERTAINMENT back then was so much less--violent. Bleak. Aggressive. And, reflecting on it as such, I think that it is a good marker for the general (I hate to use the term, but I can't think of a better one) moral temperature of society. I don't mean so much ""moral"" really, because that has religious connotations; I guess maybe I mean ""healthy.""

So, you listen to the tunes that were popular when I was growing up. Pre-Vietnam, and even through the Flower Power times, the songs were at least innocent and at most edgy/cynical. A parallel could be drawn with movies and TV shows. Maybury RFD. Petticoat Junction. Green Acres. Stuff that makes us roll our eyes today, it's so kitschy. You did have your cowboys and indians that had lots of shooting, and dying and stuff, but the actual violence was not glorified; you didn't see buckets of blood spraying in slo-mo as people got lit up with showers of lead. I remember when Pulp Fiction came out, it seemed so over the top; nowadays grandmas watch stuff that make Pulp Fiction seem like I Dream of Jeannie. 

The point is, for some reason, back then apparently people WANTED to ignore the violence that existed in the world and so turned to and surrounded themselves with fairly white bread forms of entertainment to allow them to forget that it exists. These days, for some reason, the reverse is true, and that is what many of us choose to fill our heads with when we have down time. 

I'm wondering--why? Why do we choose to do so, and why did it come to be?

Video games. Of course not all video games are violent, but let's look at some of the ones that are. (Again I find it necessary to emphasize that I am not casting judgment here. I would be the last to tell people what to do in their free time, and the very last to attempt say to ban violent video games. I'm just trying to understand.) If you could somehow bring a person from the 1950s forward in time to show them a typical 1st person shooter game, they would be TRAUMATIZED. Their sensibilities would be too delicate. If you sat that person down and had them listen to some gangster rap, I think their eyes might roll back in their head and they'd have some sort of seizure. But we've evolved in this type of entertainment so slowly that it is nothing to us today. 

And if you go back a generation further before my time, listen to the music of that generation, it's even more innocent. It's all about swing and dancing and ""making love"" (in the innocent sense) and paeans to love and such. Again, it's all so innocent that it sounds comical to our ears today.

But even on popular radio, which you'd think would be produced to appeal to the broadest and thus most PG audience, you've got lyrics about throwing up in the bathtub, having to stay high all the time to keep [him] off your mind, so on and so forth. It's all so much darker and in my eyes nihilistic. 

I said I wasn't judgmental, and I'm not. I don't want to be the old dude who complains about all the shit the young generation listens to. I don't really care what people listen to, or watch, or read. I'm not moralizing. I'm interested in the sociology of this and the political ramifications. 

Can we conclude that we really do live in a much more aggressive and violent society, at least in terms of the way people think? The fact that we are willing to absorb such violence and aggression and darkness in our supposed ""downtime""--who would willingly subject themselves to all this stuff if they actually had to experience it in real life? 

Is that the key, the fact that we actually lead very safe and insular lives these days, to the point where we need this edgy stuff to make us feel alive--compared to people who lived in more dangerous days, where death, sickness, and violence was much more commonplace and visible, and so people tried to find gentle, placid modes of entertainment to escape it all? 

Your thoughts, please.
