cvm1tys,1,t3_3n99yr,CUDawg30,"Sure this might play a role however there are many people in this country that come from broken homes that live great respectable lives and never commit a crime. I think we have to look at the overall life of these criminals to make an accurate determination of what brought them to this point. Bullying, mental health, friendships, home environment (not the broken home but was the criminal abused as a child, was the parents radical in their beliefs, were they raised to be a racist, is there drug or alcohol abuse prevalent in the household, was the relationship between the parents violent, and so on and so forth) all should be evaluated in these cases.

So what. That's true of EVERYBODY in every walk of life. What the OP did is find a common thread and I'm saying it makes sense.  IMO Divorce is not a net positive for society. Are you of the opinion that it is?",-1,0,1443815250,1444720391
cvm1nai,0,t1_cvm1i9v,littlebitsoffluff,"I think divorce can be a net positive for society, yes, if it means that the child is exposed to an environment better after the divorce than previous, it's good. There's nothing worse than a miserable marriage that goes on decade after decade because the parents won't divorce for some reason. That said, I think it's too rough a measurement to use for cause/effect. You may as well use violent video game use or use of psychotropic medication as measures, they paint with as wide a brush.",1,0,1443815459,1444720391

A lot of times desperate mothers make poor decisions and bring into the home a man that's interested in the child. How often do you read where the boyfriend has killed the child? And then there are the situations where the children learn women are treated like the town bike. 

The kids also learn that when you have kids that they are not the most important thing. They learn that they come second in life. ",-1,0,1443818844,1444720391

cvm26ik,0,t1_cvm1nai,Honest_Discussion,"This may be hard, but I ask that you not look at on a case-by-case basis. I feel like the situation you're scared of could be a problem. But it's exceedingly rare. Divorce is more popular than ever so your fear of bad marriages staying together is less than ever. This was probably common in the 50's (a time with alot less mass shootings btw). What is much more common are parents that couldn't handle difficult times or commitment and simply threw in the towel. In the meantime, they're children were damaged and were left less able to deal with life's troubles themselves. 

They also were (in many examples) front row witnesses to anger, hate, conflict and blame. *More often than not*, children suffer from divorce. I can't imagine you disagree with that.",0,0,1443816281,1444720391
cvm2nv8,0,t1_cvm26ik,littlebitsoffluff,"I think my answer to that is not that it's not that we want to try to avoid divorce so much as what we want are happy marriages. Divorce is the outcome of unhappy marriages. Life for the kids can get either better or worse after a divorce, and kids can be miserable in a family that SHOULD be divorced but isn't; but in any case, it would have been better if those kids had lived under a happy marriage in the first place.
