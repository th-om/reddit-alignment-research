(Never mind that he has PLENTY of time for twitter wars with celebrities but can't seem to find time in his day for civility.) 

It's not right to use the 'N' word. Because of Political Correctness? No. Because using that word is simply rude and there is a history of racism in this country that is represented by that word. And it's rude. 

Calling a woman a 'Pig' or using language to insult and degrade a person or a group of people -- it's just rude.

I disagree. I too find Rosie to be a pig. Not because she is a woman, or because she is fat, but because she is so obnoxious that a squealing pig really is a great way to describe her.

>He could have taken the high road and ignored it. Or he could have responded with a joke or two at her expense. But his twitter tirade against Rosie was uncivil and it went on for days.

You were the one acting as her white night and brought it all up. The idea that her participation, or what she said doesn't matter seems wrong to me.

I'm guessing that deep down inside you understand what I mean, and that is why you blew off what it was that Rosie said. Because if you had to look at what she said, and acknowledge that she too was acting like an asshole - it would detract from your point.

>""I've always been a believer in second chances. Tara is a good person. Tara has tried hard. Tara is going to be given a second chance,"" Trump said on December 19. Conner was allowed to keep her crown but had to go to rehab.

>The next day O'Donnell, who was a co-host of ""The View"" at the time, criticized his decision, saying that she doesn't ""enjoy"" Trump and said he went bankrupt -- a claim Trump continues to deny, most recently at Thursday's GOP debate.

>She added that Trump is ""not a self-made man"" but a ""snake-oil salesman on Little House On The Prairie,"" and she proceeded to slam his multiple marriages: ""[He] left the first wife -- had an affair. [He] had kids both times, but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America. Donald, sit and spin, my friend.""

I'm not even sure that was all she said... But certainly insulting a man's living, wives, and children is a bit of a smear. It's certainly a ""UnProvoked"" attack like the one you are accusing donald of making, isn't it?

cuydbgs,0,t1_cuy9u7o,srasmus4,"But ""decency"" is a changing social norm, and what is happening right now is that some groups are making organized pushes to change those norms. In the 1890's you could have used the N-word and it would have been considered fine, now you can't because social standards have changed. ""Tranny"" and ""retarded"" used to be a totally fine words to say, but now some groups are arguing they are essentially slurs. It's possible that in time not using the ""R-Word"" or using gender inclusive language will be considered basic human decency rather than a political statement.

""Political correctness"" is to ""basic decency"" what ""terrorist"" is to ""freedom-fighter"". If you don't like an attempt to make something a social norm you call it a controlling attempt at political correctness designed to limit speech, if you think it is reasonable you call it basic decency motivated by compassion and respect for others. 

But social norms (what words it is appropriate to use) are always constructed and contested and always being fought over. To call the current battle over language wrong because it attempt to control speech ignores that we have always been limited in what it is socially acceptable to say. But to say that this is ""basic decency"" ignores the fact that people had to fight for it to become indecent to use the N-word. We should acknowledge that what it is appropriate to say does not stem from instinctual decency but rather contested social norms, and discuss the value of the new norms we strive to create rather than vilifying the act of creating norms in the first place or pretending that what we are doing is not creating new norms.

I'm not terribly convinced they'll collapse society either, unless they succeed in realizing their grand, ultimately socialist vision.  More realistically, though, I worry that in their haste to shower historically disadvantaged groups with free stuff from the government that they will create that which they claim to be wholly against -- institutional oppression of a certain group, based on inherent traits of that group's members.

They managed to get the female-only contraceptives mandate passed during the ACA, and the Title IX kangaroo ""courts"" that now expel young men from their educational institutions based on mere accusations.  Those things are law, and at this point, those of us who fall *outside* of the SJWs' favored victims would be fools to assume that they are diligently weighing their desire to help the historically disadvantaged with the rights of those outside those groups.
