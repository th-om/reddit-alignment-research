3kfuwt,Why wasn't Kim Davis just fired?,27,LocalYocal,"      Kim Davis, the Rowan County clerk who had repeatedly refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, was released from prison earlier this week after a brief stint. Although she probably wasn't in prison long enough to develop a homosexual relationship of her own. 

What surprises me, is that she’s headed back to work next week. The fact that a low level government employee, earning a generous salary can retain employment after being deliberately insubordinate and going to jail for five days, speaks volumes about our government’s disfunction. If you’re still curious about how much Kim Davis is able to make it rain, she makes about $80,000/year. Which given the fact she lives in Kentucky, means she could be swimming in her money like Scrooge McDuck. If you adjust that salary to other parts of the country, in relation to the cost of living, it equates to about $250,00 - $300,000 in places like New York or Los Angeles. (www.payscale.com).

So we have a clerk at a local courthouse in Kentucky, with so little respect for the legal process and tax payers, that she’s willing to put personal beliefs ahead of it all. Furthermore the only way to reason with her, is to waste more tax dollars by forcibly removing and jailing her. Why wasn’t she just fired in the first place and how is she returning to her cushy government job?

This is one of the reasons people hate the government. It’s not necessarily the pointless arguing, wasted money, or special interest HJ’s. It’s the fact that a mouth breather like Kim Davis, easily collects probably twice the salary that her skill sets would fetch in the private sector. Even with that in mind, she is so ungrateful and feels comfortable enough in her employment to pull this crap. 

If Kim Davis had refused to give marriage licenses on the basis of race, there is no chance she would be coming back to work. However since it has to do with gay marriage, we really think she deserves another shot. Despite the fact that she was so stubborn that she let the issue escalate to the point where she needed to be removed by US Marshall's. Could you imagine showing up to your job tomorrow, getting sent home for intentionally disobeying a company policy and then being asked give it another go next week? Well you had better be as smart as Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory or at least be the owner’s nephew, because it’s not reality. 

Which brings me to the ridiculousness of why gay marriage was illegal in the first place. I think it’s safe to say that the opposition to gay marriage is primarily a bible thumper pursuit, which is fine. However a marriage certificate is legal document, intertwined with our tax code. So how if there’s a separation between church and state, did we ever allow religious values to govern a state issued license and discriminate against tax payers?

That’s really the point of all of this for me. I’ve always been in support of gay marriage, because that’s just more girls for me. Beyond that though, I’m very into this country actually being the land of the free and the government staying out of people’s personal lives. Whether it be playing poker on the internet or smoking a plant, there is still a lot of forbidden liberties in this so called land of the free. Is this what we a king’s ransom in tax’s for, to be told what to do?

Because our government is no longer a noble entity trying to make America a better place. It’s a collective of people like Kim Davis, looking out for themselves and wasting our money to try and dictate how they think we should live our lives. I can tell you that shareholders would never tolerate this type of behavior of an employee of a company. We should instill that free market principle in Kim Davis. We should send her out into today’s fierce job market and let her see how grateful she should be, that taxpayers let her be a clerk with generous compensation. 

So this issue isn’t about gay marriage, which for the record I am 100% in support of. If you don’t like gay marriage, then don’t be gay married. No one is telling you to be gay, except for maybe the voices in your head. If you’re comfortable with your own sexuality, other people’s shouldn’t be much of a concern. What we all need to agree on though, is we need to start reminding the employees who’s boss.
