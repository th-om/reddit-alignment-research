3mabon,Does anyone else dislike every major and minor political party in the United States?,19,BrianW1999,"I see Republicans as being for the most part, selfish ""every man for himself"", religious nuts, and war mongers. Domestically, they don't believe in anything but making as much money as possible. If some jackass like Donald Trump makes billions of dollars while others starve to death they think it's good. Greed is their mantra. Their Neo-Conservative foreign policy terrifies me. We saw how that worked with George W. Bush and his cronies. I think most Republicans are ignorant science deniers as well.

On the other hand, I see Democrats as being delusional humanists that think everyone is good and that we should open our borders to every barely literate biped that walks the Earth. I believe the Democrats are all about lifting women, minorities and the handicapped above traditional Americans like myself. Their foreign policy is much less insane than Republicans, generally speaking. They want to kill a whole lot less people. 

I see libertarians as being the extreme selfishness of the Republican party combined with the delusion that government only does bad. If they had their way, every human would live in a bubble and our economy would probably collapse. Their Ayn Rand domestic vision is horrifying. It would be selfishness to the extreme. 

What am I to do? I usually try to vote for the less crazy candidate but if I have to choose between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush or Donald Trump I may stop participating in our political process.
