3kvh5y,"Can someone explain the Hillary Clinton email, ""scandal?""",89,velocirapture88,"I am not a particularly tech savvy person so all this talk of various servers and such doesn't make much sense to me. Being a Liberal Democrat I tried watching FOX news last night to help me grasp why this issue is being taken so seriously by both the Republican House and right wing media.

The anchor on FOX spent the majority of the segment yelling over the woman she was interviewing. The message of her screaming seemed to be that Hillary had illegally wiped her servers and destroyed Government property in order to hide her complicity in the Benghazi attacks. The interviewee tried refuting this but was promtly taken off air in favor of Ann Coulter. Coulter's opinion was brilliant in its simplicity. This became obvious when she announced, ""Hillary Clinton is stupid!"" At this point I turned the television off. I refuse to watch some political witch hunt and that is all that FOX news seemed interested in doing.

So is this new Email ""controversy,"" a total non- scandal like Benghazi? Or did Clinton actually do something legitimately illegal or wrong with her emails/servers? I'm hoping Reddit can give me some real information in a way I can understand. If you could ELI5 any technical aspects I would really appreciate it. Thanks. 

Edit: So much for just getting some simple information on how exactly government email and servers work. 

At least now I know Hillary Clinton planned Benghazi to cover up her and Obama's illegal arms deals to Syria. Now that I have the truth I can ignore all contradictory evidence and vote Trump 2016!/s ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kvh5y/can_someone_explain_the_hillary_clinton_email/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442207998,1444729224
