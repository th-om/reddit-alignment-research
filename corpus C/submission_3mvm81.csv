3mvm81,My healthcare reform idea.,17,LDM123,"1. Nationalize emergency rooms and place them under the National Emergency Services. These rooms will be federally funded and only allow patients with emergencies. Including Heart attacks, stab wounds, gun shots, etc. 
2. Disallow states from creating barriers to health insurance companies from other states. 
3. Reword the ACA so that insurance companies are allowed to refuse coverage for pre-existing conditions WITH THE EXCEPTION OF genetic diseases.
4. If a patient gets sick, goes to the hospital, and if for any reason their insurance policy changes from the time that they contracted the disease, to the time that they were treated, allow the patient to claim coverage from their old insurance policy to pay for treatment.
5. Eliminate requirements for states to build healthcare exchanges, and instead let the federal government take control of all existing exchanges along with building new ones in states that have not yet built an exchange. 
6. Eliminate Medicare, Medicaid, and VA care and replace all of them with a unified, single public payer option that has negotiating power over healthcare contracts, and allow low-income, elderly, and veterans to qualify.
7. Eliminate the 10 essential health benefits requirement from Obamacare. 
8. Fix Healthcare.gov to eliminate its glitches and add a better layer of cyber security.
