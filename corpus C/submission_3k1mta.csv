3k1mta,The DNC's problem of having low turnout in midterm elections is about to become a huge problem.,21,revanyo,"The problem is that the democratic bench is constantly shrinking. A majority of potential Democratic Presidential and Senate candidates will never have the chance because they lost in 2010 and 2014. The only midterm that the Democrats had success in was 2006 and that was in the wake of the darkest Bush Era days. Take a look at the 2016 election. The GOP has 17 name candidates running. However, while some of them are doing it only for money or recognition, that leaves a solid ten and is more than the DNC's two.

Also, consider what happens if Clinton withdraws from the race. The only other options seem to be Al Gore or Joe Bide. Im sorry but those two people dont exactly insight energy into the party base.

Not only that but when you look at the 2018 or 2020 elections it gets worse. A lot of the GOP candidates in 2016 were seen as potential back in 2012 and maybe 2011. Now, dont get me wrong there are some people like Cory Brooker, E. Warren, the Castros, ect that seem good. However a lot of them dont have the experience yet(Castros), or seem more like VP's.

In my state of Colorado our Senator Mark Udall seemed like a potential national candidate, until her lost his election in a mid term. Not to mention that countless Governors and Senators who seemed poised for higher callings but they lost in midterms as well.

Back in Colorado the GOP is having a hard time finding someone to challenge Michael Bennett. However, for the DNC it is just as worse. Outside of Bennett the DNC does not have much. They have 3 house members who don't fit the bill of a statewide official, none of the offices(Treasury, Justice, State), and no rising state assembly members. While the GOP has some, they just need to convince them to run.
