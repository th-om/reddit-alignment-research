3n1i46,Was the Cold War truly about the struggle of two competing ideologies (communism vs. capitalism) as much as we are led to believe?,54,lifeisgood25,"Or is it more accurately described as a battle of two superpowers competing for world hegemony, wanting to create a unipolar world for themselves (which the US ultimately did), and not necessarily about who's economic system better serves their own people? As shown through proxy wars, subversion, imperialism, propping up of dictators, espionage, etc, by both sides, which seemingly have nothing to do with who has the better economic system. Why couldn't the US and Soviet Union have minded their own business, and let the results of their economic systems show for themselves who was better?  Am I missing something here?",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3n1i46/was_the_cold_war_truly_about_the_struggle_of_two/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443660467,1444721260
