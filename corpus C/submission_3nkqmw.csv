3nkqmw,What about a handgun ban?,196,Phantazein,"Handguns were used in roughly 70% of all gun related homicides(1) and most of the shooters in the recent mass shootings used hand guns(2). A handgun ban would help the biggest gun issue this nation faces, which is inner city crime. If we can get handguns off the street through buy back programs and strict penalties for possession of a handguns we can reduce violence in the most dangerous parts of America. When handguns become rare it will be easier to police inner cities because rifles and shotguns will be harder to conceal.

This way people can still hunt, protect their homes, and stop a evil tyrannical government, but we can curb gun violence. Thoughts?
