My wife and I are retired and live on a little homestead farm and live off our investments, so we can make our income whatever we want. So, instead of 75k next year, what if we make 60k?

The phone drone probably failed to tell you she was estimating based on your zip code and average plan cost rather then giving you an accurate figure. The way the credit works also hasn't been well explained.

The credit is both income and policy cost dependent and sets a limit on household spending of 9.56% if you qualify, if the policy cost without a credit is still under 9.56% of household spending you don't qualify (various household maximums exist ranging from 2% to 9.56%).

400% of FPL is the maximum for the credit, $63,720 from December.

She was estimating based on the average policy cost for the zip code not the policy you would actually choose, many states have seen the introduction of co-op's who maintain low introductory rates for a year or two before raising them but this brings down the average enough to screw up the calculator.

TL;DR: Under your current income you don't qualify, if your income fell you might qualify depending on which silver policy you chose.

She had just moved in with me when she applied and we had just moved into a new place very recently.

They asked us for information proving our income, we sent in our w-2s but lost our subsidy anyway. We tried to sign back up but the application didn't go through and the appeal papers we were told we'd get in the mail never came. We had to cancel because we couldn't afford to pay almost a fifth of our income on insurance. Now not only do we not have insurance but we have to pay a fine come tax time. Well we randomly got a letter saying we had signed up and to pay our first bill last week followed by a letter saying we had been found eligible for a subsidy. Now it's been like 5 months since we lost our insurance and i didn't sign up for anything and i have no idea why or how we were signed up. I'm going to call them this weekend and ask whats up. If we can get back on insurance I'd love to and I'm planning on looking into an exemption because we lost our subsidy for part of the year.

""An individual who meets these income requirements must also meet the other eligibility criteria described in section 5"".  

So it doesn't say X, it says X and the criteria in section 5.   How are you on those?

Also, how are you defining your income?  

>For purposes of the premium tax credit, your household income is your modified adjusted gross income plus that of every other individual in your family for whom you can properly claim a personal exemption deduction and who is required to file a federal income tax return. Modified adjusted gross income is the adjusted gross income on your federal income tax return plus any excluded foreign income, nontaxable Social Security benefits (including tier 1 railroad retirement benefits), and tax-exempt interest received or accrued during the taxable year.

Are the numbers you are giving us accounting for all that?  Sounds like you are living off capital gains, perhaps that is a factor?

So in terms of using the health insurance marketplace, it's pointless to put in children because they won't be counted in your household size. 
 
Feel free to play with my info on there... I am in Greene County. I am 31, so is my wife. Neither of us use tobacco.
