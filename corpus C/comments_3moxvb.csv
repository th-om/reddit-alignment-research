I'm on board with you about everything else, but I disagree bigtime with this one.  

Profit motive is the reason someone will invest 10 years of their life, and $300,000 in debt to become a doctor.  Profit motive is the reason someone will take the risk to personally guarantee $70,000 in loans to build-out a custom space to grow a practice.  Profit motive is the reason someone will pay $40,000+ a year in malpractice insurance premiums.  Profit motive is the reason why you pay $90,000 annually to have outstanding nurse practitioner on staff, and $60,000 annually to have outstanding registered nurses on staff.  (By the way, I'm exactly describing a friend's experience.)  I could go on.  

Yes, doctors genuinely love medicine as well, otherwise they wouldn't get involved, but profit motive is what makes the world turn.  It is a necessary evil in order to even produce medical services in the first place.  Even in a government single-payer system, doctors still have to make enormous up-front sacrifices that they otherwise wouldn't take were it not for profit motive.

I'm not so sure about this.  I'm admittedly not well-ready on the subject, but I did a little googling just now, and it seems like there are persuasive arguments that private toll roads are, overall, more efficient from an input/output perspective.  (Granted, they limit transportation because you gotta pay for them, and you disproportionately hurt the poor who have to pay just to get to work, so there are huge benefits to public roads as well.)",0,0,1443464369,1444722981

So will every system. Even if 100% of every person's efforts were dedicated to providing health care, some people would die of diseases that would be curable if only more research had been done into their disease rather than some other one. Some people would die because only the best surgeons in the world could successfully perform their needed operation, and all of those surgeons were off performing surgery on other patients that also needed them.

Even if they wanted with all of their hearts to allocate resources to the things that would benefit society most, they'd just be guessing about how best to achieve that with the resources they have available.

Customers get lower prices than they would otherwise get, which means more pharmaceuticals would be developed if the government didn't mandate that bargaining. Customers themselves have no actual bargaining power, because they don't have the right to opt out of paying for the government to bargain that way and instead use that money to bid up prices so that more pharmaceuticals get produced.

Not true in the most cases, but what's your point? Hospitals are just a part of the health care system, and the rest is also exceedingly tightly regulated. There's no reason to believe the urgency of hospital patients has very much to do with the existence of regulations on hospitals.

>Good Healthcare, like a good firefighting service has 100% coverage. If you ignore a fire, it has a tendency to spread and hit many other houses. You wouldnt be ok with a percentage of households being completely ignored by firefighting services.

If you're buying a house and the neighbors don't have fire protection, insurance companies aren't going to want to cover your house, so you're probably going to pick a different place to live. That's not very hard for the market to solve, now that fire protection is extremely cheap compared to the past and everyone has home insurance. You can also install sprinklers in your house. Instead of letting the market take care of it, we have public fire departments that are still growing in size and budget despite the number of fires falling rapidly, so you've picked a pretty bad example. Fire departments, like all other bureaucracies, exist solely to expand.

>Firefighting was once privately insured, it didnt work very well, so it became a public service. Now you would be hardpressed to find a country with private firefighting.

Lots of things didn't work very well 100+ years ago by today's standards because people were poor and didn't have our advanced technology. If governments had nationalized food production 150 years ago you'd be telling me we used to have private food production but it didn't work very well so it became a public service. Meanwhile we'd have 25% of the population working in food production because bureaucracies resist shrinking with all of their power.

>If you compare countries with public healthcare to America, they all have equal or much better standards of living, even in healthcare.

Why are you bringing up a healthcare system you acknowledge to be extremely heavily regulated, when we're talking about the consequences of a healthcare system with low or non-existent levels of regulation?

>There are no fully private healthcare countries that also have high standards of living. Its purely a theoretical Idea, like a prosperous communist society.

>Like I said, the free market works well for many goods and servies, but does a poor job with others.

Perhaps. Does government do a good enough job with the few places where the market doesn't do very well (very small number of things) to justify the government predictably putting its tentacles in the areas that the market does do well (nearly everything) and gumming them up? I doubt it. If government could possibly be restricted to areas where it actually does better than the market, maybe it wouldn't be a bad deal. But that's not how governments operate. They exist to expand.

>You could not have a privately run fire service

Why not?

That is undoubtedly more difficult because there's an actual public goods problem there. Is it worth the public goods problem necessarily created by having a government? Maybe not.

Different foods affect how much food you want to eat, and corn happens to be one that makes you want to overeat. Whether the bureaucrats could have known when the programs started is not relevant. We know it today, but the subsidies won't be going away because that's not how government works.

No, you see where politicians have invited themselves to intrude into the market and concluded they must have 1) been smart enough to know they could actually make it better with their policies and 2) cared seriously about whether they were making it better, rather than following ideology or worse.

>The reason why firefighting and street lighting are called public goods is that they only work when everyone has coverage.

Firefighting isn't a very good example of a public good, because the externalities can easily be handled privately. Street lighting is only a public good on public streets. On private streets, the street owner can restrict who can be around to use the lights, so it's not a public good.

> If one house on the street isnt covered by a fire fighting service, then a fire risks spreading to other houses.

Which is well known and can easily be handled privately. See, if your house doesn't have fire protection, the values of the houses surrounding your house go down. That ends up making the value of your house go down. And it's quite possible for private agreements to be made which require all houses in some neighborhood to be protected. It's not a big problem today because we're rich enough to actually be able to afford decent fire protection.

>Or, sewage systems, where not only is not having it has a serious knock on effect and hazard to your neighbor but the up front installation costs are prohibitive for private investment.

If private investment can fund skyscrapers, I think it can fund sewage systems.

>There are are no private systems in advanced countries because they do not work.

How do you know they don't work?

>Failed systems do not stay around for very long,

So every system that doesn't exist is a failed system? In the year 1775, would you have concluded modern democracy was a failed system because it didn't exist?

In some markets, the incentives and conditions are such that the people who privately benefit the most from some policy have an easy time convincing other relevant people to go along with the system. It's easy enough for doctors and insurance companies and hospitals to convince well-meaning stooges that their industries should be heavily regulated, and it's quite obviously been hugely beneficial for the people currently succeeding in those industries to have them regulated. So it happens. In some industries it's harder to make that argument, and in others there aren't as many benefits to making it.

>thats why state owned farms dont exist in advanced countries either.

State owned farms don't exist because they don't benefit the people in charge of deciding whether there should be state owned farms enough to persuade them to make state owned farms exist. That's it.",1,0,1443756467,1444722981

Given that your own link explains the serious downsides to governments attempting to set prices, I don't feel any need to point them out to you. The one I will mention is that they prevent entrepreneurs from coming up with innovative market mechanisms to take care of the problem.

>Carbon emissions

Pollution is fundamentally a dispute between the polluter and the person who doesn't want the polluter to be polluting. Governments have forcibly made themselves final arbiter of disputes. They have routinely sided with polluters since, oh, 1830. How could you expect the market to take care of pollution if government is in charge of enforcing property rights?

>Road congestion

Uh...roads are built and managed by governments. What does that have to do with a market failure? They're solely a government failure.

>Healthcare provision

This assumes the costs and benefits of health care can't be greatly privatized through freedom of association. Which they can be. The market works quite fine here.

>Unstable primary markets

No one said markets are perfect. The question is if the intervention is likely to make the world better overall. It isn't.

>Your ideas on private firefighting still result in a private company enforcing a contractual requirement that everyone buys fire protection.

No, it would be the other homeowners enforcing the contractual requirement.

America is also an example of a country where there are strict government controls on who can provide medical care, what medical equipment can be used, who can open a medical facility, who can offer health insurance, and so on. That raises the price drastically, and slows down innovation drastically, which means poor people have to rely on other people to pay for care that they could otherwise afford. The quality of care they would elect to pay for would probably have originally been lower than the mandated limit, but would have been at a price they could afford, and that quality would have increased rapidly beyond the minimum, had the market been allowed to operate.

>If you are too poor to afford the healthcare premiums, or you have a condition that makes your coverage non-profitable, the private system will leave you to die.

Like I explained to you earlier, every system, no matter how many resources it pours into health care, is going to have to make choices about who receives some of those resources and who doesn't. That is not in and of itself a criticism of any health care system. If you believe the free market will let more people die than you find acceptable, then make that case.

This is true. What you fail to understand is that intentions aren't results. It is perfectly possible for a system specifically intended to help as many people as possible to do worse than a system intended to treat those who can pay. Intentions are not results.

>This is particularly galling when many serious diseases will take away a persons ability to work and therefore afford treatment.

That's what insurance is for.

>As a result they will always move to avoid insuring those with such conditions who need it the most.

You're absolutely right. Insurance companies take on your future *unexpected* costs in exchange for upfront payment. It's unknown whether those costs will actually occur for any given individual, so the insurance company charges you less for premiums than you'd have to pay for those costs if they occurred and you didn't have insurance. If you're already suffering from some disease, then the insurance company knows they're definitely going to have to pay for it if they take you on. Their only viable option, in a free market, is to charge you even more than it would cost you to pay for that treatment on your own. It's just not a situation where insurance is a good solution. Insurance works when costs are unexpected. If you already have the disease, you're not looking for insurance. You're looking for charity.

Not much higher than the barriers to entry in most other professional fields, except for government barriers to entry of course. No other profession I know of is able to legally limit the number of people that can enter the profession each year. Doctors do that, and, surprise surprise, there's not anywhere near enough of them, and it's extremely expensive to see them.

>drugs require years of investment and research.

Yes, and? You think medicine is the only industry where businesses have to spend large sums of money to get a product out?

>Hospitals require a lot of equipment

Yes, and most of it is extremely expensive today because there are extremely heavy restrictions on who can provide that medical equipment and how they can provide it.

>plus there isnt exactly loads of trained doctors

Yes, there is a severe lack of doctors given the need for them. I wonder if that has anything to do with artificial limits on the number of schools that can accredit doctors and artificial restrictions on what sorts of medicine various types of medical professionals can practice. You're going to whine that without these restrictions, health care would be lower quality, and that may be true in some cases. But a lot of others would *actually be able to afford to get some care rather than none at all*. There are trade-offs to everything. You complain that people can't afford health care, and then champion onerous restrictions that immensely raise the price of health care. Well guess what? Everyone knows you're not going to have low prices if you have massive restrictions. And also, everyone knows the industry isn't going to advance quickly if you have massive restrictions. The way the free market works is that it incentivizes entrepreneurs to innovate and come up with new, better ways to serve people, so that in the future more people can be served better and more cheaply. You advocate for the policies that slowed down the working of the free market, and then you act as though it's the free market's fault that it hasn't shown the kind of progress advocates of the free market say it can.

> you are sick, and a hospital gives you a bill to get better, you can not negotiate, there will not be many competing hospitals or medicines to try. You have the choice to pay or suffer.

Ah, glad we agree.

>No one wants to go back to the time of poorly regulated medicine.

No one wants to go back to the time period because technology then was comparatively primitive. Many people would like to go back to the lack of restrictions, because they understand that freedom to experiment results in advancement.

>That is how you get frauds and people dying.

The market has ways of dealing with fraud, and heavy restrictions are how you get massive shortages, astronomical prices, and people suffering and dying because they aren't allowed to pay a nurse practitioner to take a quick look at them for a small fraction of the cost of seeing a doctor or because they aren't allowed to take a medication that would prevent them from dying for years but hasn't been approved by the FDA because they might experience side effects years after they'd die from not having the medicine.

>Its a guarantee people will not be able to afford it.

If they can't afford even low quality care, then they need charity. There is plenty of charity in the medical profession.

>Also, there will be long conditions that insurance will refuse to cover.

Are you referring to pre-existing conditions or to conditions that develop while you're a customer of the insurance company?

>A bad illness could guarantee you would never be able to get affordable insurance again if it had long term effects.

Yes, because **you're not looking for insurance at that point. You already know about the costs. Insurance companies take on risk, not certainties. If you already know about the costs and can't afford them, you're not looking for insurance, you're looking for charity.**

>A condition you were born with, would be a death sentence for poorer children or would preclude them from insurance for life.

Only if A) the parents didn't have insurance covering the long term costs of birth defects, which would probably be inexpensive because they're not that common and B) the parents can't afford to pay for treatment even with the help of abundant charities, possibly because there are massive restrictions on who can provide treatment and a massive slowdown in advancement because government approval is needed to do just about anything new, and the extent to which that approval actually hinges on the usefulness of the advancement depends on hoping the bureaucrats in charge have that as a priority.

>What you are left with is a portion of your society who are one bad fall or sickness from abject poverty.

>Now the free market sees no problem with people living like this, but most of the civilized world sees it as barbaric.

The free market actually does see a problem with people living like this. There are massive numbers of people that would love to pay a much lower amount of money for slightly reduced quality health care. But the market isn't allowed to offer that to them.

It will result in vastly more services being offered to the public, some which are lower quality than the current minimum level of quality which is fine because not everyone can afford the higher level of quality in the first place and not everyone needs the guaranteed minimum level of quality.

It is legal for them to do that. Some people are dumb enough to fall for it. If you want to reduce the number of people that hurt themselves through their ignorance, then educate them.

A pure private system would be one where there's no organization which the people generally regard as having special rights that other organizations don't have, i.e. political authority. But for the sake of this argument I'd be willing to accept a system which is at least not counted among those most heavily regulated by a government which spends ~40% of the GDP of its country. The problem with calling the US healthcare system private is that it's ludicrously heavily regulated, and has been for decades. If it were as heavily regulated as, say, the computer industry, I would accept it as an example of a private system.

>It says ""if you're offering insurance, you have to cover X Y and Z.""

Yes, it says that and about a dozen thousand other things.

>The government isn't examining individual cases and deciding who gets treatment.

The European population has 733 billion people and accounts for 30% of revenue for pharma.  USA has a population of 319 billion and accounts for 45% of pharma revenue.  Pharma is getting 3.5x the revenue per person in the USA compared to Europe.  If you extrapolate, total revenue could drop 33% for pharma if USA went to single payer.  

This is a source for what percentages the revenue comes from.  
http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/09/does-the-us-really-account-for-so-much-pharma-profit/24465/   

The FDA requirements for bringing a drug to market, with the testing and trials is massive.  Each time they green light a clinical trial it is a huge gamble.  Failure could cost the company hundreds of millions depending on the size of the trial(s).  

With a 33% drop in revenue, pharma companies are going to take far fewer chances and green light far fewer trials.  With less drugs going to trial, less new drugs will come to market.  Companies will then shrink their R&D since they will being doing so much less work in attempting to bring drugs to market.  

The USA is currently subsidizing the entire world's health care innovation with their for-profit health care system.  Single payer system would be great for the people of the USA, but I have no doubts that it would stifle health care innovation for the entire world, at least to some unknown degree.

> I've lived in Norway for just over 3 years, and have already acquired a lot of experience with the way the national health scheme here works.  So, inspired by other expatriates who have described their experiences, I thought I would write a bit about how the system here has worked for me.  
> 
> Some of the information I'll be giving out will get rather personal, but will be necessary to be able to describe the levels of care that I have received.  Just hop below the fold with me, and I'll do my best to describe the system as it works here.  To make it a little easier to write, I'll tackle this diary as a Q&A.  This diary is not meant to be an all-encompassing analysis of the entire public health system in Norway.  It's about my direct experiences with it, with some mention of problems I've read or heard about.  It is quite possible that I've made some factual errors.
> 
> ##Who qualifies for the public health services in Norway?
> 
> Anyone who has permission to live and work in Norway has complete access to the full range of health services that are available, regardless of how long one has lived here or whether or not one has paid any taxes.  When I first got here, it took a month before all of my paperwork was in order and I had my first work visa.  From that point on, I was in the system.
> 
> ##How does it work?  Do I get to choose my own doctor?
> 
> Shortly after moving to a new municipality (kommune), it is mandatory that one registers with the Folkeregister, or Public Registry.  Shortly thereafter, you will receive a letter with instructions on how to choose your GP (fastlege), with a list of who is available.  You can also choose a doctor in a neighboring municipality, if you wish to do so.  You are encouraged to do this online, which goes a lot faster.  Each GP has a quota of how many patients they have on their lists; I think the limit is something like 1,100.  If your chosen doctor's list is full, you can still get on it, if you used that doctor previously, then moved away and have now moved back within 3 years. You can change GPs up to 2 times in any calendar year.  You can't always get a same-day appointment with your GP, but if you call their office before 9 AM you are guaranteed to see the on-call physician.  To be guaranteed to see your GP, for a referral or checkup or similar, you need to get the appointment in advance.
> 
> ##Is it free?  Really?
> 
> Well, no.  It isn't.  Every year, each person receives a deductible card (egenandelskort) and a deductible which is set by Parliament for each year.  This year the deductible was 1780 kroner, or about **$278**.  Any time you see your GP the cost starts at 130 kroner, or roughly $20.  A specialist costs 280 kroner, or about **$44**.  All of these costs go against your deductible, as do certain prescriptions for chronic conditions, something called a blåresept or blue prescription (due to the color of the paper it's printed on).  Transport to and from specialists and/or hospitals is also counted towards your deductible.  This includes use of your own car to drive to a neighboring town for treatment as well as bus tickets, and in some cases, taxis. After you've met your deductible for the year you can apply for something called a free card (frikort).  Anything you pay over and above your deductible until you get your free card gets refunded rather quickly.  This includes transportation costs.  I tend to qualify for a free card by May.   
>   
> 
> If you have an emergency, you first go to the emergency room (legevakt). In most cases, you can be treated and released, which costs the same 130 kroner during the day, and 220 kroner ($35) at night or on the weekends. As I recall, you have to pay this cost whether or not you are admitted to the hospital.  However, that is the only cost associated with admission to the hospital in an emergency situation.  My husband has been admitted twice now, both in emergency situations, and not had to pay anything apart from the emergency room consultation.  I am not sure how this works in the case of life-or-death situations, such as serious accidents or heart attacks. In one instance, he underwent a long series of tests, including CAT scans and x-rays, and spent the night in the hospital.  The cost?  220 kroner plus I had to pay to park the darned car.      
> 
> 
> For outpatient and day surgeries, the cost is 355 kroner ($56).  I had to have two recently; one was an outpatient procedure to remove a benign skin tumor from my forehead, and was done with a local anesthetic in an operating room.  (It was a tricofolliculoma, for any docs/Latin nerds out there.) The second was a D&C, to finish off a miscarriage that had started and was taking too much time to resolve itself.  For that, I received full anaesthetic and was in the hospital for half a day; I was able to decide myself when I wanted to leave and also received transportation home via taxi; I live about 60 kilometers from the hospital.  The taxi cost me an additional 125 kroner ($20) but since I was long over my deductible, I get the costs of both surgeries and all transportation refunded.  
> 
> In some cases, treatments come with their own co-pays outside of the usual levels.  The example I'm most familiar with is fertility treatments.  These have a lifetime cost limit of 19,500 kroner or about $2,900.  This covers 3 attempts at IVF.  15,000 kroner of this go to the medicines; they cost about 9,000 kroner per attempt so you pay for the first attempt and half of the second.  The remaining 4,500 is paid to the clinic for the actual treatments and covers the medicines the day of treatment, all labwork, and embryo storage for 5 years (after which point they become non-viable, and are destroyed).  
> 
> 
> ##What about those long waiting times?
> 
> Waiting times depend on the urgency of the problem.  My father-in-law has a pacemaker and when he needed that, of course he didn't have to wait to have it put in.  If you have cancer, or any other situation that requires urgent treatment, you get it.  If you need a knee replacement, or something similar that can wait a bit, you will wait but generally not longer than 6 months.  You also have a right to up to 1 year's paid sick leave, if you are unable to perform your job duties, so it's not like you will be forced to work with a bad knee slowing you down in the meantime.
> 
> There are other, more serious situations that unfortunately have a longer waiting time.  Psychiatric services, including counseling and rehab, have about a year's waiting time.  The government is working hard to shorten these, but there is also a shortage of qualified providers in this area.
> 
> An example from my experience: I visited my GP to ask for a referral to a specialist, since despite our best efforts, I hadn't conceived after more than a year.  The wait to see the GP was about two weeks, and the wait for the specialist about a month.  When several months' treatment with the specialist had yet to achieve any results, we asked to be referred to the public IVF clinic.  We received an answer from them that there was a 4 month wait, then one week later, we had our first appointment.  So results may vary.  
> 
> Another example from experience: the aforementioned tumor.  I had to wait 3 weeks to get the biopsy, then waited about a month for the results because of Easter holidays and a long backlog.  After the results showed that I needed to get the tumor removed, I waited 2 more weeks for the surgery appointment.
> 
> ##What about prescriptions?
> 
> I spend 60 kroner a month on metformin to manage my PCOS; that's about $10.  My husband takes pills for high blood pressure; they cost about $15 for 3 months' worth.  The few other common prescriptions I've had (antibiotics, painkillers, cough meds) have been similarly reasonable in price.  I can't say much about other meds at this point.  My metformin was recently switched from one manufacturer to another, who apparently had a lower price.  One thing I will note, however, is that all of my prescriptions are manufactured in Europe, which is reassuring given the recent scandals involving Chinese-manufactured generic pharmaceuticals.

Most smart people have taken the extra 20 seconds to look further into the numbers to see that the metrics are not comparable across countries because every country uses different definitions for different results. Take infant mortality rates for example: In the US we count miscarriages and and stillbirths, other countries do not. The results in a 3 times higher death rate of infants in the US.
