cuugnoy,1,t3_3k3myl,JayConz,"Truth be told, these articles pretty much come around twice a session, so I usually don't buy into them too much.

HOWEVER, things are reaching a boiling point in the House GOP, and Boehner could very well be in trouble this time.  I still doubt it- dumping the Speaker mid-term in the middle of what will be a hectic Fall would be one of the dumbest things the House GOP could do at this time.  But past 2016?  If there is a Republican president then Boehner will almost certainly want to stay on at least one term, but if Hillary/Sanders/Biden gets elected then he probably won't want to stick around.",9,0,1441724637,1444731575
cuuhqaa,0,t1_cuugnoy,DarthGinger,"I typically don't buy into these much either, but this is the first one that I recall reading that states that Boehner's aids and top allies were worried about it.

I agree that Boenher is in trouble. He's caught between his right flank and McConnell / Pres. Obama, and he doesn't really have an out. If he sides with his right flank, he risks another government shutdown and the political ramifications. If he sides with Obama / McConnell, he risks a conservative rebellion in the House. This time just feels different than the others. He legitimately seems stuck.

>  I still doubt it- dumping the Speaker mid-term in the middle of what will be a hectic Fall would be one of the dumbest things the House GOP could do at this time.

I agree, but it's already been illustrated that a handful (25 - 30) of Republican representatives don't care. If a vote on the motion to vacate is forced and 30 Republicans vote against Boehner, then Boehner either loses or has to rely on Democrats to survive.

cuvi0zv,0,t1_cuvgle6,DarthGinger,"Definitely misremembering. The favorability of the Republican Party dropped 10 points, compared to the Democrats 4. The plurality of the American public blamed Republicans for the shutdown. The majority of the country viewed the Republican Party as too extreme. 

For all the negative PR, Republicans gained essentially nothing from the shutdown. That's where the real failure was. The only concession they won was some increased means testing, which is pretty miniscule. ",2,0,1441801175,1444731575

To say that they suffered no political ramifications from the shutdown because they won the mid-terms isn't exactly accurate.

Furthermore, they would be rolling the dice going into a presidential election year that is decidedly less favorable to them than the 2014 mid-terms. In 2016, Republicans are on the defensive in the Senate and trying to find a way to win the presidential election.

No, but hopefully they will get complacent and take away the bone, and we'll become an angry dog.
