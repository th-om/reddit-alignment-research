Incremental gains or change is the concept that small tinkering around the edges of problems leads to the solving of those problems in the long run, both because of the small, immediate gains you get right now and because of your signaling a willingness to compromise and negotiate with the other side.

Let's take your example - the ACA.  Just saying 'let's repeal it!' isn't a serious attempt at incremental change, because that simply isn't going to happen: the Dems will never go for it and a lot of it is un-repealable in this this political environment (voters actually like many of the provisions).  The Incremental Gains approach would be to tinker with it, and make the parts of it better than CAN be made better, to show that your ideas actually work.  Then, once those are in place, you tinker some more.  Then you tinker some more.  Eventually, you get to an acceptable solution; or, barring that, you've shown that you've tried to fix the problem but it just isn't working.

Don't confuse an unwillingness to compromise with being fed up.  [Peggy Noonan wrote a great piece about this during the Tea Party's rise] (http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703440604575496221482123504):

> Imagine that over at the 36-inch end you've got pure liberal thinking—more and larger government programs, a bigger government that costs more in the many ways that cost can be calculated. Over at the other end you've got conservative thinking—a government that is growing smaller and less demanding and is less expensive. You assume that when the two major parties are negotiating bills in Washington, they sort of lay down the yardstick and begin negotiations at the 18-inch line. Each party pulls in the direction it wants, and the dominant party moves the government a few inches in their direction.

> But if you look at the past half century or so you have to think: How come even when Republicans are in charge, even when they're dominant, government has always gotten larger and more expensive? It's always grown! It's as if something inexorable in our political reality—with those who think in liberal terms dominating the establishment, the media, the academy—has always tilted the starting point in negotiations away from 18 inches, and always toward liberalism, toward the 36-inch point.

> Democrats on the Hill or in the White House try to pull it up to 30, Republicans try to pull it back to 25. A deal is struck at 28. Washington Republicans call it victory: ""Hey, it coulda been 29!"" But regular conservative-minded or Republican voters see yet another loss. They could live with 18. They'd like eight. Instead it's 28.

Oh, I can clear this up for Ms. Noonan real quick: the problem is that once the GOP gets in charge, they start cozying up to their donors and approving additional spending in exchange for lining their own pockets with money and investments.

Not only that, but their own constituents don't support what they are trying to do!  For example, GOP voters are typically older and rely upon Social Security and Medicare to survive; younger members of the GOP talk about getting rid of or reforming these programs all the time, but their own voters won't support them doing so.  

So, to say 'how about spending nothing' is simply an unserious approach to governance and ignores the very real problems this spending seeks to address.

The status quo is, by definition, the current level of funding. The conservative desire is ""no funding."" The liberal desire is ""more funding."" The middle ground is, naturally, somewhere in between.

Well, one could argue that because the Democrats are in the minority in both chambers, they are not in an adequate position to propose a middle ground.

Regardless of that, McConnell has already proposed a solution that Democrats and many Republicans find acceptable: maintaining the status quo. It is expected to clear the Senate by a wide, bipartisan margin.

Evidence is to the contrary, considering the aforementioned bipartisan compromise proposed by a prominent Republican and supported by both Republicans and Democrats.

No, I'm saying that the middle ground is somewhere between funding or no funding.  If the conservatives are going to capitulate on funding, then they're going to be looking for something else in exchange, also reasonable.

> The status quo is, by definition, the current level of funding. The conservative desire is ""no funding."" The liberal desire is ""more funding."" The middle ground is, naturally, somewhere in between.

Funding naturally rises based solely on inflation, so ""more funding"" is *basically* the status quo.  If the left would like to continue this status quo, it will be interesting to see what they're willing to give up.

> Well, one could argue that because the Democrats are in the minority in both chambers, they are not in an adequate position to propose a middle ground.

This is also true, but they are also ultimately the ones holding this up.  The standard from the last 4-5 years has been set, in a sense.  The minority is expected to have an alternative in place, right?  I don't agree with it, but that's where the rhetoric is going to sit.
