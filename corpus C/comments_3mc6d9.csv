They're really big supporters so they think once a larger audience hears him speak then everyone else will love him too. That isn't necessarily the case at all. He's very far left compared to the average American and even the average democrat. 

He still has far less money, far less establishment support, doesn't have the national campaign infrastructure that Clinton has and up to this point has been the only one really campaigning so far. 

He hasn't been attacked yet. He's essentially running under the radar. He hasn't been campaigned AGAINST. He has benefitted massively from that.

Someone has to be offered up for sacrifice to the mob, Hillary fits the bill quite well in that regard.

He's way behind, but there is a long time remaining between now and the primaries.  That ground may prove difficult for her to navigate.   There is a legitimate question as to whether he can overcome her first mover advantage and positioning as ""most electable"".  

There is also a very legitimate question as to whether Biden will choose to run, which will splinter the ""mainstream"" element of the party.  Should Biden choose to run, I'd expect Obama to back him, perhaps not publicly and overtly, but perhaps with behind the scenes moves. This scenario is probably not to Hillary's benefit.

The debates could flip things overnight or cement Hillary's position as the top contender.  They will be huge, although I'm not going to make any prediction as to who emerges the winner.   I do think that Lessig's presence will work to Bernie's advantage as he should come across as more moderate on the left axis, by comparison.  

Anyhow, it will be interesting.  Long way between now and the finish of the race.  

Backing a winner tends to be a solid strategy in politics.  If the position is risky, then more proof of confirmation is needed to pull support.
