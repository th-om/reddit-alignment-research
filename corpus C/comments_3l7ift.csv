cv3ttwd,1,t3_3l7ift,lollersauce914,"> In America, Perhaps we should make a law against an individual both voting and practicing religion, when their religion dictates that there cannot be separation. Any better ideas?

Yeah, this one:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof",15,0,1442431415,1444727802
cv4fikk,0,t1_cv3ttwd,FranticOne," I never said anything about wanting to make that law. The idea is that when a voter or office holder has a religion with strict guidelines relating to government, how can there remain the separation? Republicans have formed a majority based on a religious population. That is evidence of the lack of separation. Anyone have real ideas on how we could have separation, or do you all agree that it is in fact impossible?

cv529w1,0,t1_cv3u34h,FranticOne,"That is what started my thought.  Gay marriage specifically.  It is required by religion to follow the law and the rulers, so the government ruling on gay marriage has an effect on religion.

If we had separation, government could not control marriage in anyway.  A marriage license is the government acting in accordance with religion.  

No one cared that marriages were controlled by government in accordance with Christian Religion.  Now that it is anti-Christian, they have a problem with it.

The truth is government has no right to issue marriage licenses and gay marriage is not even an issue.",1,0,1442520103,1444727805
