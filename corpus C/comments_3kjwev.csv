cuy0uwl,1,t3_3kjwev,lollersauce914,"> a popular Republican governor and at least control of one legislative branch.

That's seems like a poor way to judge how a state votes in national elections. For example, the district I grew up in reliably sent Republicans to both the state legislature and even to its congressional seat, but still voted pretty overwhelming democrat in for presidents and senators (the state is IL, so this is likely an artifact due to the electoral college and the left lean of the state overall). 

I don't have access to robust data in this regard, but given the anecdotal evidence I've seen in the district I grew up in and others, I'd really need to see data that supports the ""local elections are a good way to tell the future direction of the state in national elections"" hypothesis before I'd buy into it, personally.",8,0,1441987062,1444730064

I would argue maybe Iowa and PA has PA has been getting redder and redder and IA has gone red once in the last few elections.
