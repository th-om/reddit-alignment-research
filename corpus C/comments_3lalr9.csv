If a CEO uses his company to embezzle money from clients, he is not exempt from prosecution simply because he did it under the guise of a corporation. What does limit the liability of management in criminal cases is the burden to provide evidence of wrongdoing.

Can you prove that the CEO of GM told his subordinates to cover up the defect in ignition switched? What if someone further down the chain of command chose to hide the issue from their boss for fear of losing their job? Should a manager be held criminally responsible for negligence when he was unknowingly receiving bad information?

The burden of proof in criminal cases is on the prosecution in our legal system, and without sufficient evidence of negligent or intentional wrongdoing a conviction is improbable at best. Just saying, ""Someone knew about the problem,"" is not enough. You need specific names, dates, and verbal or written correspondence.
