3koil8,An Inconvenient Truth,11,wweldin,"The far right is loath to admit this but they have liberalism to thank for the founding of our country.  In the late 1700s a group of citizens, who the far right would today call radical liberals, banded together to form a new nation based on the ideas of equality, free speech, religious freedom, right to protest and so on.  These were radical ideas at the time and it was the liberals who kept them alive with their protests and actions.  Not a lot different from the Wall Street protests of a few years ago.  The conservatives of the day were the ones who wanted to maintain the status quo and remain part of the British empire.

The far right should get on their knees and thank God we have liberalism.  If it were not for the liberals we might be flying the Union Jack rather than the Stars and Stripes.
