In this paper we argue that the lack of spectacular growth in Mexico cannot be blamed on either the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the other reforms that were implemented, but on the lack of further judicial and structural reform after 1995.""  This is how this neoliberal b.s. always works: first, tell people that neoliberalism will improve the country's economy; then, after the neoliberal reforms have failed to improve the economy, insist that further neoliberal reforms are needed.  This is not a falsifiable theory; it is the thinking of a cult member, and it is exactly why so many academics (outside of the field of Econ, of course) have come to regard the discipline of Economics as a joke.  Note also the CEPR article I linked to stressed a comparison between the economy of Mexico post-NAFTA and the economy of Mexico prior to its neoliberal turn.

No it wouldn't because [Mexico's currency crashed 11 months after NAFTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_peso_crisis).  Any reasonable analysis would attempt to disentangle the effects of NAFTA from the effects of their unrelated economic downturn, which is what separates good analysis like NBER from shitty partisan analysis like CEPR.

Economics isn't a joke, it's a science that relies on evidence, which is why NAFTA has universal support among people who know what they're talking about.

And BTW, your posts just prove my original point.  Bernie seems like an honest, genuine person, who relies on partisan analysis to back up his priors rather than actual economic analysis.",3,0,1442078617,1444729831
cuz1hms,0,t1_cuyy097,secondsbest,"NAFTA has been overwhelmingly good for Mexicans. It's been bad for Mexican agriculture, but overall, their economy saw huge investments from US and Canadian interests that boosted Mexican production output and the economy overall. There are problems with so called free trade agreements that actually add trade protections, but that's a specific problem to be addressed.

[Here](http://www.cepr.net/publications/reports/nafta-20-years) is the Center for Economic and Policy Research on how NAFTA benefited Mexico:
""This paper compares the performance of the Mexican economy with that of the rest of the region over the past 20 years, based on the available economic and social indicators, and with its own past economic performance.  Among the results it finds that Mexico ranks 18th out of 20 Latin American countries in growth of real GDP per person, the most basic economic measure of living standards; Mexico’s poverty rate of in 2012 was almost identical to the poverty rate of 1994; real (inflation-adjusted) wages for Mexico were almost the same in 2012 as in 1994; and unemployment has increased significantly. It also notes that if NAFTA had been successful in restoring Mexico’s pre-1980 growth rate – when developmentalist economic policies were the norm – Mexico today would be a relatively high income country, with income per person significantly higher than that of Portugal or Greece.  It is unlikely that immigration reform would be a major political issue in the United States, since relatively few Mexicans would seek to cross the border.""",0,0,1442073092,1444729831
