3ksyxv,What are some good websites & facebook pages to follow for a balanced view?,17,zascar,"I've only recently started getting into US politics but now I'm really interested in it. Like many I get a lot of it from facebook from pages that I follow - however, I know they are incredibly biased. I follow the likes of Salon, Addicting Info, Huffington Post - and even though I enjoy the articles its clearly incredibly one sided.

What sites or pages do you guys follow that maybe give a more balanced view?",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ksyxv/what_are_some_good_websites_facebook_pages_to/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442165203,1444729356
