I'm sure even educated republican voters are called ""Liberal"" when dealing with these people.

Conservative gets it just as bad.  You see all the time here people say ""Well, that sounds like a typical conservative comment"" as well as the load of other uses of the word as an insult. ",10,0,1442417475,1444727890

All I can think of is how this is such a typical reddit liberal statement. The smug, self declared, intellectual superiority of reddit liberals is just unbelievable. 

>you race baiting liberal

Identity politics has become a huge flag of the democratic party. Using race, class, gender to argue any point has become so common it boarders on a parody itself. 

[In this argument here, the guy was was being unreasonable for sure, but then you countered with a completely bullshit version of the story, completely omitted the part where Michael Brown reached into the car of a cop and went after his gun.....](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/3j8jqa/autopsy_reveals_el_paso_man_who_charged_at_cops/cup7fdq?context=3) Then you called him a racist.

[Then later you claim that the autopsy was done by a crazy autopsy guy, and completely ignored the fact that there were 3 autopsy's done. One initial, one at the families request and one by the feds request (pretty sure)....](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/3j8jqa/autopsy_reveals_el_paso_man_who_charged_at_cops/cuosgqh?context=3)

I'm not here to be a dick OP, but maybe you're just not as smart as you think you are.

George H.W. Bush. He was the first politician to use ""liberal"" as an insult. IMO it's just indicative of the rising tide of conservatism in the US since the Nixon era and the increasing polarization of politics that happened concurrently.",3,0,1442415040,1444727893

FDR started the transition from ""free [from government interference]"" to ""free [with government money],"" which is why the liberal thinkers of the Enlightenment would be considered far right today, rather than far left. Many other countries still use liberal to describe the right wing.

This can happen to any word. It what has traditionally happened with words that are now considered racist. 

This has more to do with the way language lives and changes and has less to do with education. 

I think your post would have been more accurate, if you criticized people using the words like socialism or communism without really understanding the accurate definition of what those things are. But the term liberal is a bit more subjective. ",1,0,1442418607,1444727893
