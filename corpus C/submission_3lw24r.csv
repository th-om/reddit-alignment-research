3lw24r,Why are some people vehemently against the Iran nuclear deal?,126,ballandabiscuit,"I've browsed through this and other subreddits and done some Googling but so far I haven't been able to find any concrete reasons why the deal is bad other than ""we just shouldn't work with them at all, instead we should increase the sanctions and really bend 'em over.""  

It sounds like a pretty good deal to me. Iran's nuclear capabilities are essentially crippled to the point that all they can do is a little bit of non-military research for 10 or 15 years, the UN has unrestricted inspection privileges, and some of the trading sanctions on Iran are lifted to hopefully allow them to grow their economy and avoid any further unrest among the populace.
