And he would be much better prepared than he was in 2008.  He wasn't ready.  He needed 8 years on the hill to network before he would be ready.  And jumping a newbie freshman senator over the heads of senior senators created a serious amount of resentment that gets glossed over next to the more obvious racism but is absolutely a factor in how determined to spite him the senate has been.  

Having him serve his time on the senate before going after the big chair would have made things a lot easier on him.",23,0,1442709204,1444726470
cv88rac,0,t1_cv7fowf,ashstronge,"Completely agree with this post. This has been my opinion for years- Hillary would have been the better choice in 2008 and Obama would have been a far better President in 2016-2024.

Unfortunately, the democratic (and general election) voters of 2008 went with hope for change over experience and I think the country has paid a price overall for that choice. I think Hillary Clinton would have been more effective and built a better relationship with congress, which would have less to (slightly) less gridlock and more effective legislation being passed.

Obama would have had 8 years to build relationships and experience as a senator (or even vice president) which would have been a great candidate in 2016, & more importantly, a more effective president.",1,0,1442780510,1444726470
cv7hr9b,0,t1_cv7fowf,EzzeJenkins,"Very possible. 

At the same time, from Obama's own words(I'll try to find a source if you ask) he *hated* the US Senate, running for President was almost a welcome respite for him from the incessant doldrums of the US Senate. I think it's possible he would have served his term and not run again.

Political ambition can't be discounted of course but from what I've heard Obama hated the Senate, Michele hated him being away for such extended periods of time and he missed his daughters. ",2,0,1442713477,1444726470
cv7q19r,0,t1_cv7hr9b,kevinbaconjames,"What did he hate about the senate? 

He clearly doesn't mind legislative politics, after having served in the Illinois state senate for so long. And he had a real reputation as a policy wonk there. I can't imagine what it was he didn't like about the senate",1,0,1442734615,1444726474

cv7kgyy,0,t1_cv7fowf,1337Lulz,"> Having him serve his time on the senate before going after the big chair would have made things a lot easier on him.

I think it would have actually made it more difficult. In 2008 he had just enough years as a senator to politically validate him, but not enough years to really have a record that could be attacked. 

It fit nicely with his ""Hope & Change"" mantra as he appeared as a fresh face. ",5,0,1442719140,1444726474
cv9xunp,0,t1_cv7kgyy,karmapuhlease,"Publicly, yes, it helped that Obama had no record. He's talking about Obama's ability to be respected in Washington though, and it's much easier to do that if people know you to be a prominent and accomplished senator instead of a freshman who declares he's running for president because he gave a good speech at the DNC only 3 years earlier when he was just a state senator.

cv7q07d,1,t3_3lmdmn,kevinbaconjames,"Barack Obama would be in a very similar position to Hillary right now. Overwhelming establishment support, very few opponents because he has already sucked up all the endorsements and donor money. He would still have a huge wave of support as the potential first black president, plus 8 more years experience as a senator (or possibly VP). He would be a formidable opponent.

Bernie Sanders would still be running, because he was in it for the point of spreading his message, not necessarily winning. ",5,0,1442734494,1444726474

Also, I could see good ole Chelsea Clinton being groomed for the spot by the Democratic party at this point. She is 35 years old now, and she has the money and name recognition.",2,0,1442721225,1444726482
