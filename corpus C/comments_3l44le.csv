Assad no longer being in power means that Syria is free-game rather than an asset/ally of Iran & Russia. The stabilization of the Syria is practically a non-factor in the politics, it's simply about who's in charge of Syria & whether they're friends with the west or with Iran & Russia

A major behind-the-scenes part of Syria's recent political importance are proposed [pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar-Turkey_pipeline) that would either be a HUGE boost to Iran's economy or to Qatar's. Qatar is a western ally. Iran is a Russian ally --- With Assad in power, a Syrian pipeline will greatly benefit Iran. With a more pro-west leadership in Syria, the pipeline would likely hurt Iran's economy & weaken Russia's hold on European energy supply --- If the Iranian pipeline was made, then Russia & Iran would become the biggest energy suppliers to Europe

I honestly have no clue how the Iranian nuclear deal effects the energy/economic politics of Syria's civil war, Iran's economic sanctions have been lifted with the deal (which was both the reason why they wanted a lucrative pipeline so badly & the reason the U.S. didn't want them to have it)",1,0,1442549586,1444728080

The evidence of Assad's chemical weapon use is neither in dispute nor was it brought forward by the US government. Furthermore, if we wanted to be in Syria so badly fighting Assad, why would we have taken up Russia's offer for the destruction of Assad's chemical weapons? Why would we have not just said no and gone in like we said we were going to?

> the migrant crisis as an excuse to take out assad, etc...

The refugee crisis has not changed the obama administrations policy. There have been no ""renewed"" calls for Assad to step down.

What, you mean back in 1912?

> The refugees don't want Europe they want to be able to go back home, so why aren't people helping stabilize syria instead on bombing it's government?

We're not bombing its government. Assad's forces have not been the target.

How does evidence suggesting that rebels used chemical weapons mean Assad's regime did not use chemical weapons?

> Obama's red line

That he did not act on despite Assad's use of chemical weapons because he (evidently) does not want to go to war in Syria as you suggest he does.

And polls reflect the will of the Obama administration how exactly?

Was he one of Assad's soldiers? I didn't say the US-UK airstrikes don't kill civilians or even that they are a good thing. All I said is that Assad and his government are not the target. If they were, we would issue a no-fly zone and we would, ya know, actually bomb government targets instead of those of Islamist rebel groups. 


You asked ""why does the US government want to attack Syria?"" Evidence suggests that it does not. If it did, it would have seized one of the dozens of opportunities handed to it so far to do so as opposed to avoiding such a commitment as much as possible.",1,0,1442424884,1444728080

Read the article, they don't rule out some troops loyal to the assad regime could have used chemical weapons(Not assad himself), but there is strong evidence the rebels we back used it on their people. It stand to that if the rebels see it the government will strike back at them.  

>That he did not act on despite Assad's use of chemical weapons because he (evidently) does not want to go to war in Syria as you suggest he does.

There you go again saying Assad used chemical weapons yet there is no evidence he ever did. He did act, he has been funding radical Islamists in syria for a while now.

>We would issue a no-fly zone and we would, ya know, actually bomb government targets instead of those of Islamist rebel groups.

We're bombing ISIS and funding al-qaeda linked rebels who use chemical weapons on their own people at the same time.....How does that make any sense whatsoever?

Syria is just a battlefield against Iran, by itself it is not that important to the US. The intention was never to go to war directly, it was to support a rebel army to take Damascus. Obama vetoed intervention in 2013 and the end result of that saw most of America's proxy forces defeated or quit battle all together. The consequence of this disastrous decision is that the war in Syria will now require a much more significant & direct military presence than would have been desired. 

No, its not just war mongers who want it anymore. The conflict has simply been so mismanaged by this administration that now even the Europeans (France, Belgium) are publicly stating they are considering strikes and possibly ground troops in Syria. ",1,0,1442406120,1444728080
