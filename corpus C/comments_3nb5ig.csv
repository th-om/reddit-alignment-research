cvmiswj,1,t3_3nb5ig,JeterWood,"Boehner is too busy picking out furniture for his new office on K St.  The final act of his political life was getting a clean CR til December.  He has washed his hands of the mess that is Congress.

So all we have is McCarthy to rely on to prevent the next self imposed political disaster.  McCarthy is a political novice who is promising to be more to the right than Boehner.  This will not turn out well for the GOP...",2,0,1443850536,1444719991

cvmmn7i,1,t3_3nb5ig,ivetakenadickortwo,"It's primary season nationally, the ones that think they can get the more enthusiastic pro-lifers to bloc vote them will definitely be trying to get it to shut down.

You know Cruz is going to do everything in his power to do it. I honestly don't know about the others, but Cruz is going to hold it over their heads as being insufficiently anti-abortion and since it's a primary, not a national election, at this point it may work in Cruz's favor. Or it'll backfire like last time and the party establishment starts to hate him even more (if it that's possible). The damage will be done if it does and Hillary is going to hold it over their heads during the election. 

Boehner doesn't give a shit at this point, he's done herding cats. ",0,0,1443867488,1444720003

cvmq9fq,0,t1_cvmo1sc,Awesometom100,"Seriously. Republicans have the advantage here. They are offering a compromise and are being told no.

Last time they tried a shutdown it worked very well in elections.

If anything this will endanger democrats when they turn it around and say ""we offered a solution, why didn't you try and work with us?""",2,0,1443881302,1444720011
