3nfs04,Why do/don't you believe that difficult access to guns will dissuade would be mass murderers?,22,khlumps,"I think every gun debate in this sub boils down to an affirmative/negative variation of this assertion. It seems that *by the time posters reach this idea*, no one comments anymore, or *it devolves into an I'm right, you're wrong discussion*. So **let's start here**

Both sides show statistical evidence that refutes/corroborates this assertion. So let's not bring those up.

Instead, let's have a **philosophical discussion** on the answer to this question

EDIT: What is see in most posts in this sub about this. Pro-gun people vilify mass shooters as inherently evil by saying that they will find a way to get a gun even if access is difficult.

What im seeing here is


1) anti-gun side believes that mental health is impossible to police because it is hard to identify and rooted on social rejection which cant be fixed

2) both pro & anti gun sides **agree** that limiting access deters murderers, but...

3) pro-gun people believe that any laws enacted will not make acquiring guns more difficult because people love guns too much and black market will appear

The reason i made this post is i wanted to move the discussion forward. So what is the next logical question?

A) Is it a good thing to abolish the gun culture in the US?

B) Is it a good thing to force people to be more inclusive?

Is it right to frame this debate thusly:

*With respect to mass shootings, do curtail the right to bear arms, the right to freedom of association, both or neither?*",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nfs04/why_dodont_you_believe_that_difficult_access_to/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443952081,1444719467
