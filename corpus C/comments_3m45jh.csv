They show that Democrat politicians want to be compared to FDR, and the media (especially left-leaning outlets) often compares Democrats to FDR - the exact same thing that the right does with Reagan.

I've actually been very critical of the way that Republicans idolize Reagan.  They adore his small-government rhetoric, but his actions were those of a big-government statist.  

That being said, while Reddit liberals are quick to call out the GOP for their Reagan mancrush, it's important to point out that the Democrats have their own ""Reagans"" in the form of FDR and (soon) Obama.",2,0,1443071497,1444724862
