No shit on the first statement, I don't think so on the second sentence. There is plenty the NRA etc. has offered up for negotiation, like universal background checks in exchange for national concealed carry reciprocity. 

But that is not the point of my post. My point is, it's Obama's job to find a solution even with his most strident adversaries when it comes to the weal of the nation. He's not making any attempts to reach out. Clinton would have done so in a heartbeat. It's doubly sad, because Obama would score major popularity points if he made such a statement.

Or would he be alienating his base too much by consorting with the ""enemy""? If so, then the left wing politics are as guilty as the right-wing, in this case. ",2,0,1443881898,1444719683

The way he's acting now, it's his way or the highway. It would be different if he wasn't President. As President, he is supposed to suppress his personal animosities and grudges and look for a solution, even when it looks like it's impossible. 

I hate to say it, but Donald Trump would do a better job of resolving this than Obama.

Again, my last word on this (with you). ",-5,0,1443882362,1444719683

I hate to agree, but you're right.  Whether it's Obama's fault or not (mostly not) the people with whom he would need to open a dialogue would be committing political suicide by even allowing a hint that they discussed a ""compromise"" with him on this issue.
