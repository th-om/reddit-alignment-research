cvc67du,0,t1_cvbbz04,Mrs_Frisby,"Notice how Bernie supporters are constantly talking about how the GOP means that even if they get their way nothing will happen?  They are already writing excuses for a lame duck Bernie presidency.  Thats how little faith they have in him.

I'm voting for Hillary because I believe she can get things done *even in the face of GOP opposition*.  The GOP is fracturing right now with incredible amounts of infighting - [even attempts to oust their own speaker](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/249551-gop-lawmaker-seeks-to-oust-boehner)!  The clintons are wedge masters who consistently find ways to wedge off support from opposition blocks by finding some little compromise that gets just enough votes from across the aisle to move things leftward.  Play the centrists against the tea party.  The handful of sincerely religious against the hateful bigotry of the fundies.  How can you support ""Our Troops"" if you won't fund their medical care?  They can phrase left wing proposals in right wing language and get just enough bites on the hook.

Bernie's simplistic ""with me or against me"" view of the world keeps him from even seeing these opportunities, nevermind acting on them.  And he lets perfect be the enemy of good.  So yeah, he wouldn't get anything done.  ",-4,0,1443063845,1444725139
cvbkwmc,0,t1_cvbbz04,PoliticalMadman,i think how successful he is will be determined by if people actually listen to his message about a political revolution and actually keep voting.

However, he'd face opposition from many Republicans and some Democrats, and their level of cooperation or non-cooperation would make a big difference to what he would be able to achieve.",12,0,1443011951,1444725147

There are some things he wants to do that are obviously impossible unless Congress goes along, so you may some compromises made (Say a $12 minimum wage rather than $15), but I wouldn't really call those flip flops.

The only area where i expect to see significant shifts is on foreign policy once he starts receiving the daily national security briefings and whatnot; but foreign policy has never really been the focus of his campaign anyway (unlike Obama, who's opposition to the Iraq war/Gitmo was a key component of his campaign)",1,0,1443011686,1444725155
