3llux0,The poor people I work with spend their money on the most useless stuff,18,JW_2,"I'm a waiter while I am in school. Every other waiter I work with graduated high school and didn't go to college. They are in their mid twenties, live at home, and work full time at this restaurant. All of them spend money on weed, alcohol, hard drugs, video games, stereo systems for their car and tattoos. Then, without fail they complain that they are broke all the time, can't go out to eat, can't go on vacation etc. But hey, ""im getting a new tattoo next week!"" they say.

It's none of my business, so I never say anything, but it bothers me that they complain about being broke. Well, maybe you wouldn't be so broke if you didn't spend your money on tattoos and drugs. 

I really don't have much sympathy for them when they complain about not having money, and frankly I have no reason to think many other people in their economic situation are like this.
