3m0s2q,What issue are you on the fence on?,21,mrmoustache8765,"For example I'm kinda on the fence with healthcare. I mean I believe in free market principles and I can't deny that the USA has some of the best healthcare in the world (for those who can afford it...) and is constantly on the forefront of medical research. On the other hand, we're one of the most developed countries in the world and we simply don't make good affordable healthcare available to all our citizens and the cost of simple things like an ambulance ride is completely out of control. I don't know what the solution would be, I worry that federally controlled universal healthcare would just end up being ineffective at caring for 320 million people and ridiculously expensive. However, going on the way we have been is just silly. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3m0s2q/what_issue_are_you_on_the_fence_on/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442977749,1444725195
