3m6vsd,"Is it better to appeal to Independents with the head of your party's ticket and appeal to the base with your VP candidate, or is better to appeal to Independents with your VP and the base with the head of the ticket?",11,KeyzerSozee,"A lot is made of balancing the ticket, both politically wise and geographically. Romney chose Paul Ryan, a more conservative congressman from the Midwest and McCain chose Palin, a more conservative governor from Alaska. Both of those did not work out obviously. Would it be better for the GOP to have a more conservative canidate leading the ticket (like a Rubio, Paul, Carson) with a more moderate VP (Kasich, another republican not in the race)? Would Democrats be better off this way too?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3m6vsd/is_it_better_to_appeal_to_independents_with_the/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443097232,1444724716
