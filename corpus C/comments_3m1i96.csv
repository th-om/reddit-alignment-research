cvbeoln,0,t1_cvb8hvi,BrawnyJava,"Its not completely baseless.  The President made three controversial recess appointments to the NLRB, which were later ruled unconstitutional.  So basically the President packed the NLRB with pro labor officials.

One of the things the bakers union at Hostess was fond of doing was filing thousands of petty grievances and then bringing this to the NLRB as evidence that management was not ""fair"" or something.  NLRB uses these findings of fairness when deciding how to rule in a contract dispute.  The UAW also files thousands of petty grievances before contract negotiations.

The main thing the owners of Hostess were weighing when deciding what to do was ""Is the NLRB going to give us a fair hearing, or are they going to impose an unfair contract?""  Had the NLRB imposed a contract, they could have imposed one that made it impossible for Hostess to make money because Hostess would be forced to pay far too much for labor.  And made them more inefficient via work rules.

So, had the President not stacked the NLRB with union cronies, Hostess would have taken their case to NLRB instead of opting to shut the doors and liquidate.  

The NLRB system as a whole is a pile of shit and needs to be scrapped.",0,0,1443021262,1444725172

cvb6o5b,1,t3_3m1i96,DevonWeeks,"I heard people blame him for successful foreign policy once.  Still don't know what was wrong with them.

There's always going to be the uninformed base that doesn't really understand what the president actually does and what he has control over and doesn't.  President's have an impact on the stock market to a degree, but it's really not all that much.  But, overall, Obama has actually had it pretty easy in regards to what he gets blamed for.  I mean, compare pretty much anything you can think of regarding Obama to people saying they saw Bush and Cheney with TNT blowing the levies in New Orleans.  Or the people who blamed Clinton for the uprising in Mogadishu that led to Somalia's civil war (that was admittedly started by Ethiopia's communist regime, not Clinton).  Hell, remember Reagan and George H. W. Bush?  They got blamed for Iran keeping hostages!  Overall, Obama has been the beneficiary of quite an unusual level of leniency.  The American people can lose their heads pretty quickly, but for the most part they've been rather low key with Obama.  ",3,0,1443001522,1444725172

cvbn9o3,0,t1_cvbn34n,DevonWeeks,"Yup.  I remember Carter and his foreign policy blunders, and it doesn't come anywhere close to what we see with Obama.  At least with Carter you could argue the balance of positives and negatives because he had a few of both.  But, Obama?  It's this lengthy novella of failures with a flyer of successes.  It's objectively the most failed foreign policy in my lifetime.  Even JFK was better than this, and he was pretty awful with foreign affairs.  ",1,0,1443033684,1444725172
