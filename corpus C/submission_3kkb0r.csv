3kkb0r,9/11 - How things have changed,70,carter1984,"I thought that it being the anniversary I would put forth a couple of questions for discussion - 

1 - What was your very first reaction to the news that a plane had hit the WTC, and did you end up watching quickly enough to see the second one hit?

2 - What have we learned in the last 14 years, if anything?

3 - If you were President on that day, would you have done anything different than Bush did, both immediately and in the years that followed?

4 - How safe do you believe we are from another coordinated attack such as this one happening today (or anytime in the near future)?",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3kkb0r/911_how_things_have_changed/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441991140,1444730014
