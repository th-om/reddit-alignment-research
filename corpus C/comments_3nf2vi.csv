An economist will tell you that corporate taxes are administratively silly because the taxes corporations pay are ultimately passed on to consumers through pricing, plus the cost of that administration and regulatory compliance. Therefore we should eliminate the burden and just levy the tax on the earners who end up paying it anyway.

They would argue tariffs are threats to global economic integration, and economic efficiency. Comparative advantage FTW.

Most of what economists do on a day to day basis, especially those in academia (I am less familiar with those working in industry), is empirical research. They measure things that have already happened. The fact that we are dealing with humans is a ""not even wrong"" criticism. It is just completely irrelevant to the point. Economist use clever statistical design to measure the effect of the stimulus (or any other policiy choice).  There are extremely valid ways to criticize the empirical methodology of economics, but the fact that human behavior is involved isn't one of them. 

I am sure that ""plenty of stimulus money did not lead to massive hiring"". However, the tools of economics tell us that, on balance, we would have been much worse off without the stimulus. 

Forget the stimulus for a second. There are dozens of other issues where economist have a near consensus. Rent controls cause problems. We can look at places that use rent controls and places that do not use rent controls that are otherwise very similar, measure things like housing prices and availability, and come to a conclusion. Free trade is good. We can compare otherwise similar places that have high or low barriers to trade and make the same kind of conclusions. I could go on, but I don't want to belabor the point. There are a massive number of policy outcomes that economist agree on. These do not involve forecasting in any meaningful sense. 

The economist being polled by IGM, specifically, are all extremely bright. They have heard every criticism you have just uttered and more.

You are clever but you know what I am talking about. Every instantiation of fiat currency, prior to the current tries, have hyperinflated. If economists were measuring what has happened and adjusting based on science we would not have fiat money. The government wants fiat money and they have loads to pay to economists with the right answer. You can deny and obfuscate all you want. Lord knows there are mountains of economist precedent for you to pull from but you are just evading the reality of fiat money.

They did not fail. They were abandoned because government did not like the restriction on their spending that commodity caused.

cvpa7m1,0,t1_cvp970s,CompactedConscience,">the facts I am trying to drag out

What facts? There are no facts here that support your argument. Not every fiat currency has hyperinflated by any meaningful definition of the word hyperinflation. The fact is, the vast majority of fiat currencies that **ever** existed still exist. You say ""prior to the current tries"" but there are so relatively few that don't exist anymore. Especially not ones that started in a modern context. Weimar Germany and Zimbabwe are pretty much the only two notable examples of a fiat currency failing since the turn of the 20th century. Whereas the bullion backed dollar, pound sterling, franc, etc. all failed between the 1930s and 1970s. They ceased being a useful currency. They were extremely vulnerable to speculative attacks. They did not allow the combination of capital mobility and monetary policy flexibility that fiat currencies do. These failures were true of every single bullion backed currency that ever existed in the entire history of mankind. 

Economists evaluate the performance of actual currencies and conclude that fiat currencies are better than bullion backed currencies. Fiat currencies can be managed such that expansionary monetary policy can be used to offset recessions and contractionary monetary policy can be used to constrain price levels during more normal times.


Inflation does not cause a currency to fail. There is no mechanism by where inflation would lead to a currency not serving its purpose. Hyperinflation might, because the value is changing so quick that commerce is effected. And that phenomena is extremely rare. 

Bullion backed currencies don't provide any meaningful restrictions on spending that fiat currencies do not also provide.  Most economists work in academia. They are paid by universities, and not the government. Some work in industry or government, but their opinions do not differ meaningfully from those that work in academia. Most economists are motivated by the professional prestige (that leads to better paying jobs) that comes from doing good research that earns the respect of their peers). Throughout this conversation you have demonstrated an ignorance of how economist come to conclusions, but call them corrupt anyway. You have demonstrated an ignorance of the mechanics of inflation or how the trajectory that currencies have gone it, but drawn conclusions about the benefits of inflation and the course of currencies anyway. I am focused on your style of argumentation, because the mental gymnastics fascinate me.

Three times in the US alone. The colonies tried it and failed to hyperinflation. We printed paper money during the revolutionary war and it failed to hyperinflation to the point where people abandoned it for tobacco as currency. The cycle repeated during the civil war. That is three strikes in one location - yay science and math. 

>Economists evaluate the performance of actual currencies and conclude that fiat currencies are better than bullion backed currencies.

Better for banks but not better for the people. From 1870 to 1900 wages for the poorest workers doubled while price moved between -1% inflation and 1% inflation keeping prices stable. This was during the creation of great prosperity and a huge expansion of the economy. There was no central planning or central bank. The money was gold.

>Bullion backed currencies don't provide any meaningful restrictions on spending that fiat currencies do not also provide.

This is fiction. I am not sure what ""bullion backed securities"" are that you keep bringing up but a proper gold standard will restrict government from unlimited money creation.
