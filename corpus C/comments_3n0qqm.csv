cvjsmu3,1,t3_3n0qqm,thatnameagain,">However, their critique seems awkward politically given that Obama has been in the president for the past six+ years and that most of the police brutality cases have occurred under Democratic city governance like in New York and in Ferguson, MO.

The presidency has nothing to do with local police departments or law enforcement. 

Local democrats failed to reform police practices while in office, and people are mad at them and pushing them to do so, and some are. Republicans more often side with police unions and oppose more reform/oversight for police, so it's not like it would make more sense for the protesters to go looking for them for help.

cvjum4x,1,t3_3n0qqm,syncopator,"I'm angry about the fact that our government is being ever increasingly used as a tool to benefit the few at the expense of the many.

When was the last time a piece of legislation of enacted that *clearly* benefitted the people more than it did the industries and institutions lobbying the government?  It wasn't the ACA.  It wasn't the Patriot Act or any of it's renewals.  It wasn't the Bush tax cuts.  Somebody help me out here.....

I'm angry that in the name of national security our government has wrapped itself in secrecy, essentially removing from public scrutiny any actions it would rather not explain.  There is no doubt that there are many things that should be kept secret, but a President's legal arguments and memos granting himself the authority to execute a US citizen without due process aren't among those things.  The documents and memos that argued the US can torture prisoners of war in violation of US and international law, then refuse to investigate these violations are also not among those things.

I'm angry that we are every day stepping further and further away from a truly democratic society while we routinely destroy the power structures of other countries in the name of ""democracy"".

cvkktjb,1,t3_3n0qqm,prinzplagueorange,"You are confusing the left with the Democratic Party.  They are not the same thing.  Progressives want the U.S. to return to the economic policies the country followed during the post-WWII era (1950s-mid-1970s).  This consists of using the federal government to support full employment, unionization, and raising taxes on rich people and corporations.  Progressives believe that this traditional Keyensian approach worked better at expanding the middle-class than the economic policies that have become dominant in the first-world during the last 40 years.  Socialists generally agree with Progressives but insist that those economic policies only became mainstream in the post-war era due to aggressive class warfare waged by sections of the international working-class.  

The Democratic Party claims to uphold the legacy of the economic policies, but realistically, it does very little to expand these policies and often works to subvert them (for instance, Bill Clinton's ""ending welfare as we know it,"" Obama's refusal to fight for card check, etc.).  The Republican Party, by contrast, is explicitly hostile to those economic policies.  Many ordinary Democrats have not recognized that the Democratic Party is now economically a center right party (though moderately left on social issues).  Leftists who support Sanders either believe that it is possible to force the Democratic Party into returning to its post-war economic agenda or that it is possible to educate the working class into recognizing the Democratic Party's near-absolute betrayal of that agenda (and thereby leading Progressives to split from the Democratic Party).",1,0,1443713880,1444721288
