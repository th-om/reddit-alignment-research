Petty, yes.  Although it speaks to a lot of issues in the mainstream, too.  At its root is a corruption in this genre of media, but we can see the same sort of gladhanding between the media and politicians, between reporters and the access they get to certain officials, in the more mainstream world.

For all the talk of not being so easily offended and how we should avoid making gaming or the internet the battleground for some culture war, the gg movement is doing a pretty good job of setting an example of exactly what they're saying the Bad Guys are doing:

Getting super offended over nothing: tumblrinaction is literally people sifting through tumblr for examples of dumb things people say so everyone can get good and mad. So 14 year old Hanna from Wisconsin wants to be called a dragonkin or some shit- who cares? 1000 commenters apparently can get pretty pissed about it.

Using overinflated language to make small things seem like a big deal:  see above, you just tried to claim Greatest Generation status for what amounts to a bunch of complaint emails. You're literally using war and battle language to describe your point of view on what is just in our society. Want to see a social justice Warrior? Find a mirror. 

Using political correctness to stifle free speech: I bet if you wrote a piece for HuffPo about how games don't need to change at all, you'd get some disagreement. If you wrote a piece saying games are sexist or racist or whatever, you might want to make sure your home phone number is unlisted. Might be a good idea to stay off twitter for a month or so too. Yeah, the people doing that stuff don't represent the core of the movement, but it does happen.


Yes, some random  YouTuber says games are sexist. There are other people saying movies, books, TV shows and the news are sexist and racist, or anti-christian, or too sexual, or too violent, or not diverse enough or too diverse. There is literally nothing in the world of entertainment that nobody is complaining about. 

And yes, some random game developer was in bed with journalists, but entertainment journalism is a hack job in every area. You think Entertainment Tonight really did love the new fantastic four movie? Or did it have something to do with the ads they were running for the movie? Gaming isn't being targeted, they're just being exposed to the same crappy entertainment media everyone else kind of puts up with. 

Of course people are upset about political correctness. They always have been. The Brady bunch had to show the parents sleeping in seperate beds,  Star Trek had to almost scam the network to show an interracial kiss, Archie Bunker's character was a constant source of controversy on TV.  The Clinton era was filled with claims of political correctness and whether it had gone too far. People have always argued about social issues, and will always argue about them. It happens, but it doesn't mean Evil is winning. People just think other people shouldn't be assholes and disagree about what that means. 

Tldr: political correctness isn't new and you didn't defeat it, you just started paying attention. ",3,0,1441833270,1444731218

It's my personal opinion that video games are my son's generation's curse, so when I hear about college campuses full of feckless students too afraid to have an opinion, I naturally blame video games.  It's not that video games have made them dumb so much as video games are what they live for, so best not to make waves least you risk life infringing on your gaming time.  Or something like that.  A pretty unpopular opinion, especially on reddit, and not one I really feel like arguing for.  So to get it off my chest I decided to argue against the premise and see what happened.  Cheers.  I'm in my 40s, have 4 kids and don't play video games.",1,0,1441896522,1444731218
