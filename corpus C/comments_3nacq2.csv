A backpack would be a terrible place to carry concealed.  It's better than nothing but not much.  Rather than being used in your scenario you made, the backpack is more likely to be forgotten someplace and the gun stolen.",4,0,1443829974,1444720111
cvmamh8,1,t3_3nacq2,boker49,A better way to argue your point would be to show statistics or actual stories of conceal carry being effective at stopping crime. Your post presents your argument as a fantastical scenario. I also don't like how it borders on victim blaming. ,7,0,1443831299,1444720111
