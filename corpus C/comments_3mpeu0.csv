cvgxq8s,1,t3_3mpeu0,NonHomogenized,"No, for a number of reasons. 

First, George McGovern only won the primary in 1972 because of the split between the Southern Democrats and the rest of the party, which split the vote between Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace, which is a fundamentally different situation than the comparatively united Democratic party of today. The entire path to the nomination is necessarily different today.

Second, he was facing a popular incumbent Republican president, not an open field... and not only that, a popular incumbent president who ran a 'dirty tricks' campaign which engaged in the kind of conduct which eventually led to his resignation to avoid impeachment. There isn't anyone to play that role in 2016.

Third, the demographics of America are fundamentally different than 1972, which fundamentally changes the electoral landscape.",40,0,1443453474,1444722893
cvhzvjz,1,t3_3mpeu0,EuroYankee,"Nonhomogenized is correct in that the situation is very different from 1972; but I will go once step further. I posit that the correct analogue to a Sanders nomination is that of Ronald Reagan. 

Like Reagan, Sanders has spent decades in the wilderness. He has endured the long period in which “liberal” was a dirty epithet, and “socialism” even worse. But his time has arrived, and I would bet that we will see “Bernie Republicans” come out and support him.
And after all, why not? Bernie represents the economic interests of what we used to call “Reagan Democrats” - every one of his positions enjoys strong majority support among ALL Americans, regardless of party affiliation.

Ronald Reagan didn’t just become President in 1980 - he also led a successful national movement - what was called the “Reagan Revolution” – one which not only won the White House but gave the GOP control in the Senate for the first time in 26 years. I am old enough to remember it, having voted in that election as a liberal  - and I remember how shocked everyone was that Reagan won, because he was thought to be too “radical”.  Remember, Medicare and Medicaid had only been passed a scant decade earlier, and the socialist streak in the American consciousness was still thought to be strong. Reagan had to fight for the nomination against the “establishment” GOP, and the RNC limited the primary debates to only 6 because they were so afraid he would get the nomination. Such a move has not been done since, except for this year when the DNC did the same thing to shut out Bernie Sanders.

But Reagan did win. And he won BIG. If anyone had told me in 1979 that a far-right cowboy B-movie actor who was against social security and against Medicare and against unions and against civil rights would win in Michigan, Massachusetts, New York, and yes, even Vermont, I would have told them they were CRAZY.
So go ahead. Call us crazy.

Most countries don't have a population of 312 million, or a GDP per capita of $56,000, so of *course* they aren't going to be spending $1 trillion on anything. 

> Democratic president Obama wasn't even able to get a public option passed

Because he didn't try. He took it off the table in the name of ""compromise"" early on (and never even seriously advanced the idea of single-payer), dragging the negotiations towards the status quo from the beginning.

If you [look at polling from the time](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-most-back-public-health-care-option/), a clear majority of Americans backed a public option. According to a Rasmussen poll from [2013](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/healthcare/march_2013/46_oppose_single_payer_health_care_system), almost 40% of likely voters support single payer health care, which is consistent with [this 2009 poll by Kaiser Family Foundation](https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7990.pdf). I'd call something supported by something approaching 40% of the population pretty ""mainstream"".",1,0,1443470361,1444722909
cvhckaq,0,t1_cvh95ko,ZenerDiod,">Most major countries do, however, have some form of government-run health care system to ensure universal health care, and provisions by the government to control health care costs. In some cases, that's single-payer; there are other models which have been implemented as well.

As do we, ever heard of the Affordable Healthcare Act?

>Many of them do have widespread support in one of the major parties.

Show me broad Democratic support.

>Yet many do have a FTT. And in fact, from 1914 until 1966, so did the US. And there are other major countries considering FTTs.

Only one country has tried it close to the scaled that Bernie is asked for and it was a disaster that raised less then 1/10 of the revenue it was supposed to and repealed.

>Most countries don't have a population of 312 million, or a GDP per capita of $56,000, so of course they aren't going to be spending $1 trillion on anything.

Still none of this proves we need 1 trillion dollars on anything. 

>Because he didn't try. He took it off the table in the name of ""compromise"" early on (and never even seriously advanced the idea of single-payer), dragging the negotiations towards the status quo from the beginning.

It took off the table because even Democrats wouldn't vote for it, even the bill he passed got many Democrats that for *it* kicked out of office.

Polls go up and down based on the media cycle and how the question is asked, as most voters are low information.

Suppose that Democrats had lost the 2012 election by 18.2 percentage points, as Walter Mondale did to Ronald Reagan.

They don't vote because they don't see voting as important. Most people under 30 don't have the economic pressures that weigh down on them every day (mortgage, kids, medical bills) that adults and older people do. They're more isolated and more often rely on their parents for support and information thus there's a separation from how government (via taxes and services) affects them. The under-30 crowd is much more interested in social acceptance and bettering themselves so they place more importance on working and socializing, thus studying up on politics often falls by the wayside.

The problem for the Republicans is that their extremist rhetoric has produced a base that is out of touch with the rest of America. In order to win the primary Republican candidates have to say all kinds of crazy shit. On the other side of the aisle, the Democrats don't have a culturally and ideologically cohesive base so they campaign in the primary just like they campaign in the general election. Unlike the GOP primary where you win by cornering the market on hardcore conservative white people. 

Whoever the Democratic nominee is has the advantage in the general election. They will have proven themselves able to appeal to a broad coalition of voters and won't have a lot of extremist statements to explain away like the Republican nominee.
