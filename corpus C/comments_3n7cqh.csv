On a geopolitical factor as long as Iran, Syria, Russia, and China try to become a power in the region Saudi Arabia will remain a ally of the Western Powers to counter this move.

Oil matters - sure. But we don't get that much oil from Saudi Arabia (most of ours comes from Canada and Mexico)

The other reason is that Saudi Arabia is a major Arab influencer, much like Egypt is/was. They're the head of the Gulf nations (UAE, Qatar, Baharain, etc.) and thus wield incredible influence.

Also, as the leader of the richest Arab nations, they have a lot of influence on the world affairs of the Arab nations. As thus, they help keep Israel safe, keep the Persian Gulf/Straits of Hormuz open to traffic, etc.

Finally, consider that we are allies with the Saudi monarchy. Yes, many of their citizens do donate money to groups that are hostile to the US. But at the same time, imagine if the monarchy - which has been attacked by extremists before - disappeared, and those citizens ruled themselves.
