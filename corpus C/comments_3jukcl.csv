In short, the foundation of morality sets a person up to have conservative/liberal ideals,  the video describes a 5 channel morality and how people who are conservative tend to feel strongly about all 5 channels while liberals are passionate more about just a couple/few and discard the others.",12,0,1441546953,1444732224
cusi4el,0,t1_cusg15y,,"Haidt is good for bringing that kind of thinking into the mainstream, but I think most of what he says is absolute nonsense. His five foundations were pretty clearly made post hoc (which is a problem with all theories that use evolutionary biology to explain human behavior - you can always come up with some just-so story), and they reflect his very obvious agenda to tell liberal academia that they aren't any more enlightened than the average Fox News viewer. His whole book is colored by that, and it skews everything he says. You could probably come to the exact opposite conclusions if you substitute the average Tumblr poster for the professors and compare all that to Mises and Hayek. What Haidt actually discovered is a separation between intellectual ethics and parochial morality, which is something he points out in the beginning of the book without understanding the consequences for his own idea.

His idea is much better expressed by just breaking it down into consequentialism and deontology. Moral thinking tends to work through those two channels: ""is it good"" and ""is it right."" People on the left tend to think almost exclusively consequentialist, people on the right mix the two, and libertarians are exclusively deontological. This makes a lot of sense out of politics: Liberals don't understand how conservatives oppose things on bases that aren't immediately-consequential (""big government"", federalism, ""dependency"") and so see them as obstructionists or reactionaries; Conservatives don't understand how people disregard some of those things and so see liberals as subversive or naive.",11,0,1441552175,1444732228

I've never seen it expressed like this. Since you seem to know what you're talking about, what happens when someone perceives consequentialist reasons for conservative or libertarian policies?

This coupling was disastrous because it allowed communists and Leftists to portray themselves as scientific ""progressives"" when they were no such thing; and to portray supporters of capitalism as being stuck in the religious past, when capitalism was in fact the most radical advance beyond that past.
