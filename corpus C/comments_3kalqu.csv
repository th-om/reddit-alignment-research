>Holding the government budget hostage to change something that already exists strikes most people as an illegitimate way to change policy.

Meaning that if Republicans have the votes, they can either repeal the part of Title X that gives federal funding to Planned Parenthood or garner enough votes to pass a budget without that funding in it by offering Democrats something in return.  At a certain point though, an offer can become ridiculous.  Saying to Democrats ""get rid of this funding that's existed for the past 45 years and we'll let the government function"" doesn't strike people as legitimate because ""the government"" consists mostly of people and things who are totally unrelated to this debate.  There are levels of legitimacy, and some processes are more legitimate than others.  If this type of channel is reasonable then we've set a pretty low bar.

>Meaning that if Republicans have the votes, they can either repeal the part of Title X that gives federal funding to Planned Parenthood or garner enough votes to pass a budget without that funding in it by offering Democrats something in return.

First, the idea that a budgetary item should be included in the next budget by default until it's repealed strikes me as patently absurd. Each budget should stand entirely on its own. Second, I think we both know that there's nothing that Republicans could realistically offer that would convince Democrats to accept a budget that doesn't fund Planned Parenthood.
