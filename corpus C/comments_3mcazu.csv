The real danger is losing employees all together.  There is a fairly intensive training program for my job which qualifies us for better non government jobs.  The stability makes the federal job more appealing.  Take away the stability and people might start leaving even more frequently then they do already.

They would have to hire a bunch of people to make up for those leaving which would lead to more mistakes and probably a long term cost increase from the additional training and inevitable fuck ups by new people. ",8,0,1443202578,1444723720

Most projects (all of the ones that fall under 'non essential') get a stop-work order, meaning we cant charge to the project - we *legally cannot do work on the project*.

Since my company (and others like mine) actually get paid per employee hour on contracts, my company cannot afford to pay me my paycheck.  If I can't 'bill out' my company is not making any money and I don't have any work to do.  Some projects/contracts that belong to 'essential' parts of the government retain their funding, and management tries to put people onto those contracts.  If I can't be put onto a contract like that or when that contract runs out of funds for the billing cycle I have to take a vacation (if I want to get paid) or take unpaid time off.

It's really really shitty.  The government workers all get their pay furloughed so it's a little tough (they have to have savings) but they still get that money later.  People in my industry lose money and/or vacation time.",6,0,1443196430,1444723720

cve3jde,0,t1_cve19ve,maddata,"I don't even work for the government; it's not my job that's essential or non-essential.  The projects get put on stop work or not depending on whether or not their funding gets shut down with the government (and other factors depending on how the contracts are structured).  The money is already spent, I just don't get paid and the project gets delayed.

I'm not all about gov't spending either, I'm a fiscal conservative. I totally get the political argument that, idk, HUD shouldn't be showering the world with vouchers, but building a website to see if you qualify for vouchers is really not that expensive.  Again, it's not like the gov't is saving any money, it's just I don't get paid, my colleagues don't get paid...  I'd love to build websites for non-alphabet entities, and we are expanding into that market especially since gov't contracts now apparently carry a risk price tag with them.

I don't know how else to put it, but we're not doling out grants or anything like that, we're just building and hosting random websites, when the gov't suddenly might say ""You can't do work on this or get paid for a while my bad"".
