cv3w1fn,0,t1_cv3vim7,lollersauce914,I don't understand. What does a peaceful American presence in Syria look like to you? Do you mean a ground force that cooperates with Assad?,2,0,1442434539,1444727800
cv412da,0,t1_cv3w1fn,,"I don't think there is much Assad could do at this point. He controls what, a third of his country? In addition, he would expect retaliation if he attacked American troops, so he would not do so unless absolutely necessary.

cv3wh9j,0,t1_cv3w467,lollersauce914,"Ok, figured that was what you meant, was thrown off by the ""peaceful"" in there. An American military presence in Syria in support of Assad would likely not be a particularly peaceful one, lol (I get that you mean peaceful with respect to the Assad regime).

I would argue that the window has long since closed on that strategy. Assad ruling over a peaceful Syria in the future is rather wishful thinking. After nearly 5 years of a horrifically brutal civil war, I don't think most Syrians would ever back the regime again.

It reminds me of the comments by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founding father, when he wrote on the British Raj:

> The present artificial unity of India dates back only to the British conquest and is maintained by the British bayonet.

I feel like American, or more likely Iranian and Russian ""bayonets"" would be needed to keep the peace in any future Assad-ruled Syria (and lots of them).",1,0,1442435171,1444727800
cv40idd,1,t3_3l7mx8,Quetzalcoatls,"Nobody cares about John Kerry. Ash Carter has already publicly stated the Pentagon has no involvement in those talks. That is John Kerry desperately using what little influence he has left to try and accomplish something.

Keeping Russia out of the Middle East has been a longstanding policy of the United States. There is no legitimate reason to discuss allowing Russia to carve out a sphere of influence in Syria as nothing has changed that would make that presence in the United States interest. The only reason to support Russia in its current maneuvers would be to protect the Obama White House from the political fallout of a collapsing Middle East policy.",1,0,1442441176,1444727800

So that whole ISIS thing and unprecedented migrant crisis are not issues?

""Military to military"" talks coming from Lavrov is probably meaningless. If those talks are important to have, the militaries are already having them (and I'm guessing they have, what with the U.S. dropping bombs in a region where Russia is now moving forces).",1,0,1442442909,1444727800
