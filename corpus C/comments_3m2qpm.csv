Aw, you're so cute. Now go back and read that article again, and look more closely at the claim I made. The article basically says, ""at the time we're writing this, Obama has only been in office for four years, and Bush has deported more people, but if Obama is reelected and continues at this rate, he'll surpass Bush"".

Now, I don't have numbers for deportations since Obama's reelection handy, but I never claimed that he deported more. I claimed that he deported at a greater *rate*, which he absolutely did.

Try reading next time.

There's only so much that Federal agents can do in a given year, and they take their cue on what to focus on from the administration. They focused more on this issue than any prior president.

Ah, then you're talking about the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for those making over $400,000. Which could have been the tax cuts for *everyone*. All he had to do was nothing. And that would have been perfectly in line with *liberal* economic theory because, as Krugman said, tax cuts aren't stimulative.

> And the numbers speak for themselves.

of particular note: 

>Dow Jones & Co. in a letter to Romenesko responding to the study's classification of the Wall Street Journal news pages as liberal:

>""[T]he reader of this report has to travel all the way Table III on page 57 to discover that the researchers' ""study"" of the content of The Wall Street Journal covers exactly FOUR MONTHS in 2002, while the period examined for CBS News covers more than 12 years, and National Public Radio’s content is examined for more than 11 years. This huge analytical flaw results in an assessment based on comparative citings during vastly differing time periods, when the relative newsworthiness of various institutions could vary widely.

and:

>We leave to the reader the judgment on whether anyone could take seriously a coding scheme in which RAND is considered substantially more ""liberal"" than the ACLU. But this is not the only problem with Groseclose and Milyo's study; they lump together advocacy groups and think tanks that perform dramatically different functions. For instance, according to their data, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is the third most-quoted group on the list. But stories about race relations that include a quote from an NAACP representative are unlikely to be ""balanced"" with quotes from another group on their list. Their quotes will often be balanced by quotes from an individual, depending on the nature of the story; however, because there are no pro-racism groups of any legitimacy (or on Groseclose and Milyo's list), such stories will be coded as having a ""liberal bias.""",2,0,1443098489,1444725096

Feel free to search for any instance of Democrats accusing the GOP of ""blocking"" something by simply voting no on it (you won't find any).

It's different this time because absolutely nothing that happened in 2013 is happening here...this is by republicans, for republicans, and democrats & some republicans have simply voted no due to the preposterous nature of defunding planned parenthood 

The 2013 shutdown happened because the GOP wouldn't allow a spending bill funding Obamacare ***to come to a vote***....the 2015 shutdown is going to happen because the GOP can't get enough votes for a bill defunding planned parenthood ***to pass***.
