Good done in the name of Shaitan is still good.
Evil done in the name of Aslan is still evil.

If people put their echo chamber headphones down and look at what clinton *does* ... she is the most successful socialist in American politics.  Her rhetoric is centrist, but her *actions* are democratic socialist.  Bernie's rhetoric is heavily socialist but his accomplishments are nearly non-existant.  

It's great, for example, that Bernie thinks we should fund education better and speaks out about it.  Meanwhile, 30 years ago Hillary was leading the charge as first lady of Arkansas to [increase funding to Arkansas schools and got them from last in the nation to average](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/hillary-clinton-2016-arkansas-116939).   She traveled to every county in her state, met with thousands of educators, ran dozens of town halls, drafted a plan, lobbied for it, got it passed, *and increased school funding substantially.*  Thanks to her initiatives Arkansas moved from fighting with Mississippi to be last in the nation for education to average.  

Its wonderful that Bernie thinks we should raise the minimum wage again.  Where was he last time it was raised?  1996.  Under Bill Clinton.  Who delegated pushing that issue to Hillary.  Sure, Bernie voted for it ... the bare minimum action.  [But Hillary was the one networking, horse-trading, leading the way.](http://correctrecord.org/hillary-clinton-less-minimum-more-wage/) 

>The San Jose Mercury News reported in 1996, “The argument for increasing the minimum wage – which first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton endorsed Saturday – is simple and direct: The wage has not been increased since 1987 and those earning minimum wage receive no benefits or vacation.” And as she wrote in “It Takes a Village,” released earlier that year, “There are additional actions we can take, through our government, to preserve our country’s promise of opportunity for all. We can raise the minimum wage, which is nearing a forty-year low; two out of five minimum-wage earners are the sole breadwinners in their households, and many recent studies show that a modest increase does not cost jobs.” In his 2007 Hillary Clinton biography “A Woman in Charge,” Carl Bernstein wrote that, “In the ten weeks since the [1996] election, she had been working with administration officials to find ways of saving vital government services and programs that Gingrich and the Republican majority were determined to eliminate in the new session of Congress. They included legal aid for the poor, educational assistance incentives, important Medicare and Medicaid benefits, pension protection, and the minimum wage.” The minimum wage was successfully increased in August of 1996. 

Hillary has been fighting to improve health care in America [since 1979](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/the-briefing/fact-sheet-affordable-care-act/) when she spearheaded efforts to get better health care to rural areas of Arkansas while Bill was Govenor.  His tendency to delegate policy efforts to her lead to the ""attack"" of calling him ""Billary"" which opponents thought was an ice/burn slam of his manhood.  When Bill became president in his first term he again delegated health care related efforts to Hillary which lead to the creation of SCHIP:

>In the early 1990s as First Lady, when Congress defeated health care reform, Clinton refused to give up – instead, she joined with Sen. Ted Kennedy to expand health insurance to children by helping to create SCHIP. Kennedy later said of Clinton’s effort: “**The children’s health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.**” [AP, 10/05/07; Politifact, 1/6/08]

She continued to push for it as a Senator then made it central to her presidential campaign.  

Bernie, meanwhile ... um ... voted the right way?  Thats better than voting the wrong way.  But its far short of wading into the political fray and whipping votes.  Which Bernie does not do.  

Bernie says he'll try to raise taxes on the wealthy?  Thats nice.  The last time a Clinton was in office taxes on the wealthy were raised.  Who is more likely to be able to do it in 2016?  A radical with few friends and no network or the political team that got the job done in the 90s?  

Choosing Bernie over Clinton to pass socialist legislation is like choosing a chihuahua over a doberman for home defense.  As far as I know she would be the first president in American History to have both substantial experience as a chief executive ( not just her very active first lady-ships but also running her charity, organizing several other charities and running the state department ) and also have been a Senator with lots of social ties in the Senate.
