3mj2wv,Does anybody else believe that if teens were to unite and rebel against the school system that it would be a powerful thing?,54,RedditDevil2,"You know, it's just a thought. I myself am a teenager, but I wonder how the world would react to us if teens were to suddenly start a rebellion. It would kinda be cool too...I don't know, personally I think the school system sucks and I'm kind of done with the world currently. I just want to hear some of your thoughts.


By the way I hope this counts as political discussion. I didn't know what subreddit to post it in. Please don't feed me to the bear.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mj2wv/does_anybody_else_believe_that_if_teens_were_to/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443316038,1444723231
