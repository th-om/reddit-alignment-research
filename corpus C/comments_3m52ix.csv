cvcgf1p,1,t3_3m52ix,shanedoth,"The filibuster should be abolished because it creates a distortionary incumbency/status quo bias.

Under an ordinary majority-to-pass system (like the one followed by every multi-member independent agency, federal or state court, or the House of Representatives), undoing a prior action only requires flipping one vote from barely passing to barely repealing. But in the Senate, going from a filibuster proof majority requires a flip from 60-40 in favor of a policy to 60-40 against (meaning 20% of the Senate needs to change its vote). Combined with the fact that only 33% of the Senate goes up for reelection every 2 years, you have a huge status quo bias.

With legislation so hard to pass, Congress ends up writing massive must-pass omibus legislation (and playing chicken with the non-critical portions of a critical bill), knowing full well that it's too hard to pass different laws independently. So instead of 200-page bills we get 3000-page bills that cover all sorts of unrelated topics.

More pernicious still is the outsourcing of rulemaking authority to the executive and independent agencies. The FDA is charged with keeping the food supply free from harmful additives, so it passes a trans fat ban in 2014 on the authority of a statute passed by Congress in the 1930s. The FCC passed net neutrality regulations on authority granted by a 1996 statute (modifying a 1936 statute). The EPA started regulating greenhouse emissions under authority granted to them in the 70's. Congress allows this in part because they lack the expertise and the focus required to pass such legislation, but also because they lack the agility and because they can shield themselves from electoral accountability.

Quicker, smaller, more responsive legislation is impossible with the filibuster. Undoing bad laws is impractical with the filibuster. Abolishing the filibuster would allow for lower-stakes legislation, which would encourage more piecemeal, more agile legislation that responds to the political pressure. Voting the bums out should have an effect, instead of letting a former majority defeat a current majority.",0,0,1443096464,1444724818

Every time the Senate changes hands you could have huge swings. 2008: Obamacare passed. 2014: Obamacare Repealed. 2016: Obamacare Re-passed. 2018: Obamacare re-repealed. 

Some status quo is good for things like this. It stops parties from completely undoing anything the opposing party does just by switching from 51:49 to 49:51.
