cvne8u0,1,t3_3ne6l4,cjdeist92,"Part of the GOP's luck in 2014 was that most of the Senate seats up for grabs were Democratic seats, with only a few Republicans facing reelection. On top of that, the GOP capitalized on the lackluster beginnings of the ACA to distract the public from the shutdown, along with many Americans not feeling the initial impact of the shutdown.

2016 is a whole different beast. Most of the Tea Party freshmen will be facing their first reelections in the Senate, with the seat breakdown favoring the Democrats this turn around. Plus, with it being a presidential election too, the Democrats will see far better voter turnout than 2014 (Democrats tend to have lower turnout during midterms). And if the GOP is seen shutting down the government again, the Democrats will run to town with it, using it as a prime counter to the GOP's usual mantra of fiscal responsibility and management. Also, the Democrats will likely point to the last two years of GOP-controlled Congress and the lack of anything that's been accomplished besides trying to drag Clinton's campaign down (through the Benghazi and email investigations) and tearing down Planned Parenthood (and the botched hearing that's occurred on that front). Finally, the GOP is facing a civil war of its factions, making a unified fight nigh impossible right now. 

All this adds up to the Democrats having a very strong possibility of maintaining the White House and retaking at least the Senate in 2016. The GOP has a long road ahead.",31,0,1443926092,1444719523

Clinton will win the female vote by a substantially larger margin than Sanders, and that substantially larger margin will trickle down to senate and congressional races as well.  

The White House is pretty much a Democratic lock from this point forward based on (1) the baseline 255 electoral votes in solid blue states that Republicans have no chances of winning, and (2) demographic shifts in purple states like Florida and Virginia pushing them ever more blue each proceeding election.

So taking that into account, I think that a Clinton candidacy offers Democrats a huge chance to really drum up a huge female turnout that will easily put the Senate back under Democrat control, plus very possibly flip the House of Representatives as well.",2,0,1443961005,1444719531

cvnvftj,0,t1_cvne8u0,ClaraOswinOswalt,"> Most of the Tea Party freshmen will be facing their first reelections in the Senate,

The great majority of those candidates are from strongly republican districts that have [no practical chance](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-hard-line-republicans-who-pushed-john-boehner-out/) of turning blue. Many of those reps ran on a platform of noncompromise and essentially have a mandate from their constituents to do what they're doing. (I'm from Curt Clawson's district and the entire special election was basically him saying he would do whatever it took to stop the Obama Menace and accusing establishment R's of *appeasement*.)  

Other than that I think your analysis is spot on. A shutdown could definitely hurt establishment Republican's, who really don't want to lose any more numbers. Why vote for the party that comprises and deals to get things done if they don't actually have the cohesion to push through policies?  
But, I think a shutdown is either going to be neutral to or bolster the ranks of the Freedom Caucus. Sanity and reasonable practice aside, they are actually doing what they were put in office to do. Plus, voters apparently love pageantry in my district (you should see all the Trump bumper stickers) and will turn out in droves for a headline-maker.

cvoa1gm,0,t1_cvnvftj,cjdeist92,"While it's true that many, if not most of the Republican Senators up for reelection are in solidly red-states, the Democrats don't need to take out the majority in order to retake the Senate. The GOP's control over the Senate is tenuous at best, a narrow majority. And several of the Tea Party Senators are there because they knocked out sitting Democratic Senators. The DNC will likely fight tooth-and-nail to retake those seats in order to flip the Senate. Bolstered by the expected higher DNC turnout rate due to the presidential election, and there is a real possibility for the DNC to come away with a win.

A government shutdown would play right into the DNC's hands, as they will run to town with the message that the GOP cannot be trusted to manage the government--particularly the Tea Party caucus. And depending on who the GOP nominates for president, you could see a lot of synergizing between the congressional and presidential elections, especially if the GOP nominates someone like Trump or even Cruz. The Democrats lost 2014 largely because more of their seats were risky at the time and they didn't really campaign as a cohesive party (with those in red states trying to desperately distance themselves from the Obama administration and core of the party to appeal to conservative voters). This time around, the GOP is fractured, fighting among itself for control of the party. Meanwhile, the Democrats realize what's at stake in 2016 and are more likely going to learn their lesson from 2014 and fight back hard.

Essentially, 2016 is the Democrats' to lose, whereas the GOP has it's work cut out for it.",2,0,1443997435,1444719535

If I don't hear him (or her) making those points, I won't vote for him.

There's no reason to believe a *similar* shutdown wouldn't have similar impacts on Republican electoral prospects.

No. If there is a shutdown now, there is really nothing to buffer the damage; its a presidential election and there is no real Democratic scandal (like the ACA).  PP defundment would only rally a small part of the GOP party. Polls have consistently shown that a majority of Americans support PP and this scandal has actually benefited PP. Lots of woman around me are starting to get politically active for fear of the shutdown of PP (the accuracy of this is up to debate) and its leaning Democrat than GOP. 

Personally, I feel the PP issue will only rally GOP supporters in GOP strongholds which mean nothing.

They didn't even try to let private enterprise take over because the whole point is that the government wanted to show that it works against the people. ""Oh you want this thing? Well we'll violently monopolize the market and you have to bend over if you want it."" 

If those government agencies aren't willing to do what it wants to on a shoestring budget, then those agencies should be abolished.
