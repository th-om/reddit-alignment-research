""Pulling out the stops"" means putting out a new message, which is dealing with #2. As for #3, this is the same thing as #1 - she is maxed on name recognition but is also maxed on personal opinions of her. People think she's untrustworthy, but it hasn't kept her from staying in the lead. 

All that stuff in #2 about media tactics and showing humor or astroturfing really isn't what's going to matter. People don't give a shit about authenticity, unfortunately. They just need a general campaign message that is clear, simple, and has wide appeal. This is something that has been notably absent from her campaign so far, and if she can't actually craft one then yes, she will fail politics 101 and lose.

currently she's at **40%** and counting down, which is not enough to win a 2 person race. She needs Biden to stay out, and she needs to win ALL of Biden's July supporters (I'll gladly grant that) PLUS all the people who have since jumped ship from Clinton to explore Biden (I'm not sure all of them will return). I think Bernie has a pretty good chance to win the majority of O'Malley, Chafee, and unaligned voters. It's not like these voters don't know who Hillary is, they're staying unaligned for a reason. 

Fundamentally Hillary's name recognition and media are so high that this is less like a primary and somewhat more like a re-election race. An incumbent at 40% against a field of opponents is not in good shape unless that field fails to find a unifying champion.

> People think she's **untrustworthy, but it hasn't kept her from staying in the lead.** 

I think through the summer she was largely in the lead because there was a **lack of visible credible alternatives.** Bernie changed that and in turn opened the door for a Biden run. Hillary's quiet 'inevitability campaign' based on scooping up all the endorsements, Obama strategists, and early fundraising to scare away challengers certainly failed.

Mark Penn, Howard Wolfson, Lanny Davis, Terry McAuliffe etc. would beg to differ. This stuff mattered in '08 as she fell further behind on elected delegate count and her campaign spiraled into a media-driven circular firing squad.

Even with those scraps he's not taking the lead. And I disagree, I think O'Malley supporters at least would go to Hillary.

Again, disagree that that is ""not in good shape"". A 10%+ lead over all opponents is a flying lead. And that field is not going to find a unifying champion because Biden isn't running.

This is true, but only to a certain extent. Again, she still has a commanding lead. I agree that if inevitability was the only strategy her team had, then she will lose and deserves to. I don't think that we've seen the full extent of her campaign messaging. 

>Mark Penn, Howard Wolfson, Lanny Davis, Terry McAuliffe etc. would beg to differ. This stuff mattered in '08 as she fell further behind on elected delegate count and her campaign spiraled into a media-driven circular firing squad.

That's not why she lost. It was an incredibly close race with Obama, and she lost because Obama had an excellent ground game with supporters as well as a killer message. Sanders is working that angle now, but has significantly less appeal than Obama did in key demographics as well as significantly more left policies that make him a no-go for most of the Democratic base. 

In 2008 the media sharks picked her campaign apart as this was happening. But they didn't cause it to happen via picking her apart.

I'm going to disagree with both of you. Fundraising and winning endorsements has been one of, if not the most important, metrics to predicting political success. Money and friends may not be everything - but they seem to go hand in hand with election winners. 

Clinton has a political warchest that has brought in $75 Million, compared to Sander's $40 Million. [Source](http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-raised-28-million-in-3rd-quarter-edging-bernie-sanders-1443665690). Now, to be fair, in the last quarter alone, Clinton brought in $28M compared to Sanders $25M. This is inarguably impressive for a candidate who does not have the same level of name recognition that Clinton does, but that total $30M gap doesn't bode well for Sanders in the future.

Looking at Endorsements, Clinton has virtually [all Democratic endorsements to date](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/). Not a single Governor, senator, or congressperson has endorsed Sanders. Again, to be fair, in the last presidential cycle the vast majority of all endorsements were announced and declared in the days after Iowa leading up to the convention. But even then, if we were to make a comparison to 2008, Clinton has more total endorsements now than she did in 2008. Obama, at the time, was barely on the map, but he was still on it.

Sanders may be a bit more electable than many mainstream Democrats assume, but he certainly will face a much harder time in the general election than Clinton would (even with all of her baggage).

Right now the biggest aspect to the campaign is being able to sail through financially. Ask Scott Walker, who had he had a better financial single donor game, would probably be the guy to lock in once the Trump/Carson/Firoina wave dies out.  Hillary has that in spades.  As much as the media says she's vulnerable, they're completely overlooking why she's still here, her ground game is huge, and her war chest is massive.

Instead, what I am going to do is try to give an overview of campaign strategies and maybe help people who are very familiar with campaigns to understand them.

Many people see poll numbers as the ultimate measure of how a candidate is faring. Intuitively, this makes sense as it's a measure of how willing people are to vote for you. However, it's just a snap shot of how willing people are to vote for you today and in the next couple weeks. After that, it's accuracy falters which is especially true early in the game where a relatively small percentage of the electorate is really paying attention.  Even with that knowledge, it seems like there is no reason for a candidate's numbers to sink without there being something wrong with their strategy/electability. However, that's because you're only looking at one side of the equations. Most people see the strategy of best allocating your time, money, and words to get the best poll numbers. It can go the other way as well though (especially with strong front runners). You can spend your poll numbers to get more time, money, and words. 

In a way, it's similar to the game Magic: The Gathering. If you've never played it, it's a card game where you start with 20 life, can play creatures (which attack your opponent and can block your opponents attacks), and can play spells which help you or hurt your opponent. Some spells allow you to gain more life and others cost life to cast. Many new players gravitate towards spells that give you life, shy away from spells that cost life, and will sacrifice offensive creatures to avoid losing their life. It's typically a strategically poor decision because going from 20 to 18 or 8 to 6 doesn't matter. It only matters when you hit 0 and lose. So the best option isn't worrying about going down to 12 life but knowing which move will put you closer to bringing your opponent down to 0. In politics, it doesn't matter if less people would vote for you today if more people will vote for you on election day.

To bring this back to the democratic primary, Hillary doesn't need to worry about her poll numbers today since she'll be stronger tomorrow. On the other hand, Sander's strength today might be his downfall tomorrow. I'm going to list some ways Clinton benefits from laying low now and then some ways Sanders suffers from not having an active opponent. First, there are the obvious ways Clinton benefits: the email scandal will die down, it prevents gaffes, and she can focus on creating nationwide ground game. For a less obvious benefit, she can be the target of all the Republican soundbites for the next couple months and come out making it look like the GOP is scared to death of her and have the momentum carry into the general election. For how Sanders suffers from the lack of an opposition, he is running an issues-based campaign where a big risk is voter fatigue. Most people don't want to hear about the same couple big issues for months on end, it's simply tiring. Sanders is largely framing his positions in terms of inequality and it's difficult to keep people excited about a handful of issues for a year. Clinton now has time to poll-test his major points and add some more nuance so that once she is in the debates, she can make it seem like Sanders is naive and sees things in black and white. Although there is a chance that she won't be able to come back from this, the chance of failure (in the primary or general) is greater if she becomes active too early.

In the Democratic Primary, it's Hillary vs Not Hillary. The more visible Not Hillary is, the more people are going to consider Not Hillary. 

Hillary's central problem in 08 and 16 is that much of her support comes from people who are sort of accepting her as a *fait accompli*. When those people see there are alternatives, support drains away.",1,0,1443757381,1444721010

I think you misunderstood me. All else being equal, being high in the polls is better than being low. However, all else being equal doesn't exist in this case. In order to become and remain high in the polls, you need to give something up (typically time and money). So there are times, typically when you are the frontrunner, where the stuff you give up to remain high in the polls is worth more than the poll numbers themselves.


Why should Clinton spend a bunch of time an money to win by a massive margin? Winning is winning. She can (or at least believes she can) wait, avoid saying anything stupid and spending money, to win by thinner margin. There's no reason to spend a bunch of money to win 80% of the vote in the primary when she can capture 60% and have that much more to spend during the general. What benefit does she gain from trying to remain ridiculously high in the polls?

Read less reddit; that might be how the majority of the progressive faction feels but that's far from the majority of the democratic base. Her favorability is high when she's visible.

I just think that's flatly wrong, as becomes more clear day by day as she drops in polling, her fundraising stagnates, and people increasingly look to a Biden run.

It's a timing issue.  There's still an entire year until the elections and Hillary (and more observers) don't see Sanders as a true threat, so why waste your ammo on him?

Releasing too much info too early, when nobody is paying attention, or getting into the weeds unnecessarily, only has the ability to damage her at this point.  There's literally no upside to her 'trying hard' right now.  She's doing the right thing by laying low and letting the action on the right-side of the fence play out.

As for her poll numbers, they were always artificially high and a product of her name recognition - I believe that she, like most Dem observers, expected them to drop significantly (both via Sanders and via the GOP nominee) as time went on and the country reverted to its usual polarized voting/polling state.",5,0,1443720956,1444721014

How about this upside: if she ""tried hard"" during this stage of the election, Biden wouldn't jump in and she'd be running against Sanders, who most consider unable to win the nomination, literally making her a lock.
