In our fantasies the innocent are protected and the guilty are punished. Yes, I said ""fantasies"" because we have an idealized notion of crime and punishment and it's causing some serious problems.

A recent study points out that [4% of the people on death row](http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/04/study-suggests-that-4-of-the-people-we-put-on-death-row-are-innocent/) are innocent and that percentage is higher for those sentenced to life in prison.

No. The overwhelming majority of murderers I worked with in corrections before I GTFO are basically normal people, not the incredibly warped Gacy types everyone envisions. I'll take murderers any day over rapists and especially thieves. Noticed quite an inverse relationship between how much someone relishes ""tough on crime"" policies and actual experience with the prison system. 

Most of the killings were committed in combat - either in warfare with enemy soldiers (aka gangs) or personal disputes that would've once been handled with dueling, or were fueled by provocation on the part of the victims. Recall one case where a guy came back from Iraq to find out that his wife had shacked up with a ""Jody"" and moved him into their home, and was absolutely rubbing his face in it. Guy had packed up his movable possessions and was leaving, then they are on audio laughing at him and bragging about all the money they were going to make selling the stuff he had to leave behind. Cue him snapping, grabbing his sidearm, and dispatching them both. 

People love the idea of sentencing people in life in prison because it's emotionally satisfying, and they can mentally file that abstract person away and never think of them again. They don't see the side of it from those who look at those who've been thrown away as garbage every day. 

If you were going to remodel the US prison system (frankly I'd rather destroy the entire concept) , it'd have to have a lot of Scandinavian-esque reforms -- 21 year max sentences with extensions if they continue to prove dangerous, comfortable conditions, efforts at keeping the inmates from becoming severed from how the outside world works, actual rehabilitative focus and high quality psychiatric evaluation, frequent paroles, etc.
