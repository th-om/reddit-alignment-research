3mf1ie,Why not bring back feudalism?,15,,"Lets start off this conversation by me saying that medieval peasants actually had it overall a lot better than most people realize, the average persons life actually went down after industrialization rather than up. So whats so wrong with there being a peasant class? We have a working class today, both of those things are servants, so why force people to earn wages like chumps in this current system? Can't we have a tiered land ownership system instead, with lords and land guilds instead of mega corporations who dominate the agricultural industry and bring in untold numbers of immigrants. Why can't citizens work the land? Getting a STEM degree just makes you a higher paid servile wage-slave, so why not be free instead? On your own land under the protection of a lord or guild, and who can be protected by a constitution.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mf1ie/why_not_bring_back_feudalism/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443234833,1444723512
