3m7lfc,Health Insurance Marketplace Woes,92,ellipses1,"To preface this, I was a bit supporter of the ACA and of President Obama in general. I've read how straightforward the process is to use the health care marketplace on reddit... last year was difficult for us to get through the process, but we were in the middle of a move to a different county and our internet sucks... we ended up getting coverage, but I thought this year would go much smoother.
 
That said, after trying to use the Health Insurance Marketplace for the second year in a row, I'm ready to shoot myself in the face.
 
First, I received a letter in the mail saying that it was time to review our coverage for 2016 and make any changes. 
 
Great, we want to add our 2 year old to our marketplace plan. He's currently enrolled in Pennsylvania's Chip insurance. 
 
Here's our situation: Wife and I are both in our early 30s. We have two kids, age 6 and 2. Our income is 75k per year. We live in Pennsylvania.
 
This should be simple, right? Everywhere you look, you see that table that says ""A family of 4 with a household income under 94k is eligible for a tax credit to reduce your monthly premiums!""
 
Except, of course... that a family of 4 doesn't exist in Pennsylvania. Here's why:
 
If your children are eligible for Chip or Medicaid, they do not count toward your household size. No problem, right? Chip and Medicaid are cheap or free, so you're still getting a break if your children are eligible. Wrong. Literally every child in the state of Pennsylvania is eligible for either Chip or Medicaid. **Edit- we pay the full premium amount for Chip. We don't get a subsidy.**
 
There is a minimum income cutoff for Chip. Under that income, your kids go on Medicaid. There is no maximum. I could make a billion dollars next year and both of my kids are eligible for Chip. 
 
I literally cannot have a family of 4 in the state of Pennsylvania in order to qualify for a tax credit. 
 
Ok. No problemo. The same income/tax credit table says that a family of 2 can make up to $62,040 and qualify for a tax credit. My wife and I are retired and live on a little homestead farm and live off our investments, so we can make our income whatever we want. So, instead of 75k next year, what if we make 60k? 
 
The woman on the phone read the eligibility results and they are for zero dollars. 
 
Ok, drop that to 55k.
 
Zero dollars.
 
50k?
 
Zero dollars.
 
40k? 
 
64 dollars per month. 
 
Despite the fact that the static, published information you find with every single search for the information says 62k, there is apparently a lot of other stuff that goes into your tax credit eligibility... and for us, we have to drop to 65% of what the table says in order to qualify for anything. 
 
And let me say, that's all well and good. I'm not trying to game the system. I just wanted to do the thing that everyone says you can do and have it be easy breezy and work... and it's a massive cluster of fuck. 4 hours later... after talking to the marketplace representative several times and a Chip representative once, we are just going to buy a policy on Highmark's website. 
 
It's absolutely retarded. This is not what I lent my support to. This is not how it was supposed to work. The marketplace should be the path of least resistance to getting insurance. 
 
Does anyone have a success story to share? A horror story? 
 
Are any of you residents of Pennsylvania with children? Have you managed to get them on a marketplace plan? Do you qualify for a tax credit? What are your family details and how are they different from mine?
