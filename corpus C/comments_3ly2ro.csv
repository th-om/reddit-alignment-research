These jobs make a lot of money because their service is in demand, not because of its human value.

The reason why healthcare is better suited to public provision is principally because it is not a suitable market good. Shoes, electronics and cars are example of excellent candidates for free market goods. Roads, water utilities and schools are good examples of goods suitable to public provision.

Healthcare is far from a pure private good in America (it is quasi-private at best). Healthcare is an absolute necessity that everyone will need, it requires a vast supporting infrastructure, and it is heavily regulated. It's not realistic to exclude people from it (people aren't just going to go ""I'm poor so I guess I'll just die) and you can't always divide it in to logical billable chunks for which prices can be negotiated prior to services being rendered (we're not selling shoes here).

Public healthcare is not a welfare program. it's an essential service needed to keep society going and virtually every developed country sees that to be true. We don't have private healthcare in this country and didn't before Obamacare either.

Not the original person you were replying to, but it's not just about sob stories. 

Healthcare isn't a commodity like a sports car. No one needs a sports car, but it's a luxury someone with enough money can buy should they have the desire. It would be preposterous to propose a universal sports car system, where everyone gets a sports car, even if they can't afford it.

It's preposterous because people don't need a sports car. An economy car or public transportation will get people from point A to point B just as affective ly.

Healthcare is not a sports car. On a long enough timescale, everyone consumes Healthcare whether they want to or not.

Let's use Jeremy as an example. Jeremy is a lazy peice of shit. He has a bad attitude, and that bad attitude has prevented him from staying employed. He never exercises and eats nothing but junk food. By age 40, he is a diabetic, but he can't afford insulin and the other diabetic treatments on his own, so he is on federally subsidized medicaid and gets everything paid for by the government.

Jeremy is the exact person you are probably thinking of. He's a peice of shit. He has not right to your hard earned tax dollars. Healthcare is not a right, and his case is just a sorry sob story. Fuck jeremy. He's an adult. He needs to pay for his own shit. So you vote for a politician who will promises to cut the states medicaid spending. And guess what? Congressman Joe Bumfuck lived up to his promise, and slashed medicaid spending, and now jeremy's insulin is no longer paid for by honest tax payers. The sorry sack of shit has to pay for his own medicine. Except, he can't. He doesn't have any money. The money he does have, he spends on booze. 

One day, having been off insulin for weeks, jeremy goes into a diabetic coma while standing in line at the liquor store. He is rushed to the hospital, where he is put on the ICU for several weeks, racking up millions in Healthcare costs that he can't pay. When he is finally released, he gets a bill for millions of dollars, but he can't pay it, so he throws the bill in the garbage. He's got shitty credit anyway, so fuck it.

Long story short, the hospital doesn't get its money from Jeremy. Until, one day you come in for a colonoscopy, and you find out that your bill is astronomical. How could a simple, routine procedure cost so much? You ask the Doc. And he tells you that they have to compensate for all the people who are unable to pay. They have to keep the lights on some way, so they raise the prices. He tells you about a law called EMTALA which requires hospitals to give people emergent care, regardless of their ability pay.

Being the politcally active person you are, you contact your congressman and get momentum going to repeal EMTALA. And whadaya know? You succeed. Now you no longer have pay higher taxes to give free medical care to the lazy folks, and you also don't have to pay for their emergent Healthcare in the form of higher Healthcare costs. You are now living in a god damn freedom utopia. 

Except, now Jeremy has no way to get the care he needs. Now he is desperate. His life is on the line. He goes into survival mode. He begins stealing, and turning to crime to get what he needs. In fact crime rates all over the country have been going up since the repeal of EMTALA and Medicaid. Now your favourite politician wants to raise taxes to pay for more law enforcement. Holy fuck. You are back where you started. You keep plugging your finger into holes, but new leaks spring up. You start to wonder, how can the leak be stopped?

cvair75,0,t1_cvah3vw,awa64,"> The government runs the VA poorly enough

The government runs the VA damned well. Patient satisfaction is great and the VA hospital network is one of the most cost-effective health care providers in the country. Sure, there are problems with wait times to see doctors and backlogs of approvals for treatment. But the former is just as big a problem in private-sector health care as it is at the VA—the VA is missing their 14-day target by 7 days, while in many cities the average wait time is over a month—and the latter was a temporary problem caused by a perfect storm of problems (influx of Iraq and Afghanistan vets, global economic crisis causing veterans to lose private-sector insurance from private-sector jobs and return to relying on the VA, and a change in standards for PTSD and Agent Orange exposure treatment qualifications leading to huge numbers of veterans re-applying for benefits). Note the use of past tense—the backlog is largely resolved.

> We can keep insurance, but medicaid needs to stop with the 'only paying a small %' so the hospitals put prices on things that are 10 times the amount they expect to get paied

Medicare and Medicaid don't do that. They publish a flat rate that they're willing to pay for a treatment or procedure, and hospitals decide whether or not they'll take Medicare and Medicaid patients based on that.

It's the private insurance companies that negotiate the pennies-on-the-dollar agreements with hospitals.

The ACA requires hospitals to publish price lists for procedures. Prior to its passage, most hospitals didn't publish procedure rates at all.

The thing seems lost in this conversation is that at an individual level, the best thing for an insurer is just to drop someone from coverage; i.e., the practice of recision or simply not accepting someone into your pool if they have a pre-existing condition.  If I have have leukemia, there is no premium at which it makes sense to insure me; from an actuarial perspective, I am nothing but a black hole of costs.

Right that's why you buy insurance *before* you need it.  The whole point is to disperse risk.  Imagine if you got free lottery tickets and but only had to pay in to collect, that won't work.

Someone might, but at pretty extreme costs.  Sort of unrelated to health insurance since it's a choice to DUI but I get your parallel.  Anyways, I'm pretty sure people don't go into contract with a health insurer and agree to lose coverage if they get sick, that sort of defeats the puropse.

What I love about this argument is that it can be used to negate any anything that utilizes analysis of reality.  Is the metric system just because everyone else uses it?  Can't tell!

But economically speaking, I just think it's backwards currently. And I'd really want to change too much of the health care system for me to propose a single plan to easily implement.

But let me address subsidizing supply. This is where we would give out subsidies to health care providers and say ""lower your price to this if you wish to keep receiving subsidies"". This shifts the supply curve to the right which lowers prices and increases supply. A new equilibrium will then be created that meets more of the demand that already existed.

But I'd really like to see a system with the following...
- Separate curative care and preventive care.
- Curative care is the ""risk"" portion that insurance is suppose to be about. I'd like to see a universal system where we do all chip in for one large insurance pool, but to the government, not insurance companies. 
- Preventive care would be left up to the ""free market"". Because this care can be thought about, customers are able to shop around. Health care providers will then compete in price and offerings. They will want to draw in customers here to get them to become customers when they need to use the insurance pool.
- No more deductibles.
- This also removes health care insurance from employment. Possible plan would be to just have all employers pay a health care tax to help pay for the curative care pool. But nothing tying your employment to your health care.
- We would also require health care to be more upfront on costs/prices. We need to totally revamp how the customer views the health care marketplace.
- Changes to actually try and reduce prices OVERALL instead of just subsidizing them.
