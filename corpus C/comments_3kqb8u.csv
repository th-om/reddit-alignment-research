Every primary will feature a different pool of candidates. It's simply too expensive and too taxing to keep running (unless you're a third party candidate or someone who always enters but exits quite early). 

2020 will bring a whole new crowd of candidates in. That is way too far away to even speculate who would enter, but the only notable omission from this current primary in my opinion is Paul Ryan. I would not be surprised in the least if he tries again in 2020. ",10,0,1442111458,1444729711

cuznj3r,0,t1_cuzn5c2,pankpankpank,"Not that strong of a tradition, and I said its usually fringe candidates, not runner-ups. Santorum, sure. But look at how he is polling this year? Awful. 

2012: Romney--Santorum runner-up (fringe)

2008: McCain--Huckabee runner-up (fringe)

Huckabee and Santorum were also both popular based on the tea party, not the GOP general electorate. 

[ENTER BUSH ERA]

2000: George H.W. Bush - runner-up John McCain

1996: Bob Dole - runner-up Pat Buchanan 

So I personally don't necessarily see that as a tradition within the GOP. Sure, they may run again, but win the nomination? History says no.

RUDY GIULIANI 21.0  
JOHN MCCAIN 12.2

And at this time in September 2011 Rick Perry was still leading polls varying with Romney, Herman Cain, and later in the year even Gingrich leading over Romney.

We both know McCain obviously came to get the nomination 2008 and Romney 2012 so of course Jeb Bush not leading the polls at this point is certainly no cause to be pessimistic if you support him. A lot, and I mean a ton, can happen between now and the primaries.",4,0,1442137682,1444729711
