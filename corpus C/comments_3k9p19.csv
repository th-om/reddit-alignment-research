From the tone of the post, I can only imagine that you are either a supporter of the status quo or something more austere. As one of the wealthiest, most influential countries on the planet, the fact we have some of the highest povery, encarceration, and infant mortality rates in the world and that we are one of the only socialized countries to not have healthcare as a guaranteed human right is, frankly, a disgrace. 

One of the major tenets of Bernie Sanders' campaign is that ""We Succeed Together"".. which is something that I think is largely lost on most people because until recently, this has been a very isolated world. No longer is that the case. Globalization/the advent of the internet has made the world a lot smaller, and given people the ability to extend their reach far beyond what they used to. 

> ""Magical free healthcare with no waiting lists""

[Did you know that you are already paying for the uninsured?](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2011/02/02/myths-of-the-free-rider-health-care-problem/)
And at rates that should make your blood boil because of a system crowded with insurance companies that obfuscate the cost of medical procedures. I'm sure you've heard ""Hospital Bills $4000, insurance only agree's to pay $900, 90% of that goes to administrative costs and 10% goes to the doctor peforming the care"" -- Its a messed up system that needs to be replaced by, yes, a ""Universal Healthcare System"", the most popular being [""Single Payer""](http://www.pnhp.org/facts/what-is-single-payer). Obamacare was important in one way, and that is that it started a discussion on healthcare reform, but the ACA did nothing to remedy the heart of the issue and that is the cost of medical care in the US. Single Payer organizes medical care under one insurer (government) and allows individuals to still seek private care at a more reasonable cost (FAR lower administrative costs, no haggling)

> and for wealthy people to give me their money

I guess this is a jab at raising the marginal tax rate on the obscenely wealthy (note that this affects the top .1%, yes the top **tenth** of the 1%). Despite the fact that even [millionaires themselves WANT to be taxed more (68% in this study)](http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2011/10/27/most-millionaires-support-warren-buffetts-tax-on-the-rich/), or the fact that he only wants it above 50%, when post WW2, the marginal tax rate was **90%** under Eisenhower. People seem to forget that this is just taxing their **income** and **only** above a *certain level* (read: obscenely large). 

At a certain level, these millionaires and billionaires (the nonsociopathic ones at least) have realized that losing that extra couple million in taxes doesnt affect them much at all because they already live an extremely lavish lifestyle and are making more than they know what to do with, **meanwhile** those extra millions can affect 10's of thousands of destitute families.. see where i'm going with this? No one is kicking the rich out of their homes and selling it to provide free ""obama phones"" to the poor (which btw, a phone # is required for most job applications, much like an address is usually a prerequisite, so I don't see how providing these people with a tool for employment is cause for outrage.. but i digress),  they are simply having those who have already reached a well insulated level of comfort, contribute a fair share so that some of the other people who may not be so fortunate can have a chance to do the same. (fair share obviously being subjective, however my empathy for the person who can only buy 3 helicopters instead of 4 this year is in rather short supply, compared to the parents who aren't eating tonight so that their child/children can because they lost their house/job during the 2008 mortgage crisis)

> I want to see a united states where I can have more than I don't work for, and pay less taxes than the people whose taxes pay my bills.

This is an argument I hear often being made by those who think that they have job safety. The implication here is that people who are struggling must not be working hard enough, not that people who are working jobs they are overqualified for and still struggle to make ends meet are being undercompensated. You have heard of income inequality, no? What about the people who want to be working but can't find a job? Are they lazy, or just unlucky? Is that their fault? Should you care? Well you might if it ends up being you. 

Are you a physician? A surgeon? A taxi driver? An accountant? How about a factory worker? How about a fast food worker? Do you know what they all have in common? [They are all going to be obsolete within the next 20-50 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)

The advent of automation is going to create an enormous amount of unemployment in this country, something we are already beginning to see. We already have terminals taking the place of fast food workers and restaurant servers. Soon bartenders will be replaced, factory lines will be entirely automated (some already are). More efficient and more sterile to have robots do medical procedures.. no more surgeons (already have Cyber Knife). Watson is already relied upon by top doctors for diagnoses (bye bye physicians). What are you going to do when your job is replaced and you are looked upon as the ""unskilled"" because you aren't a fluent programmer? (maybe you are, who the hell knows; its a hypothetical that should make you empathetic towards those who might not be, and doesnt even matter since software bots are faster and better than human programmers). We need a social system in place that will be able to take care of these large swaths of unemployed. 
[Negative Income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_income_tax) has been proposed as an idea that keeps the incentive to earn more coupled with proving a social safety net. Fully socially progressive societies would ideally be full of co-ops where the laborers own the businesses, and people would be free to pursue their passions and live a life they are proud of rather than just working to survive. Also, [the wealthy pay a lower effective tax rate than the lower and middle classes do](http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2013/03/06/as-stock-market-recovered-rich-took-bigger-share-of-nations-income-and-paid-lower-tax-rate/) so, yeah, they definitely can afford to help out some of the poor and starving.

As far as bringing the troops home, I'd invite you to look up how the fall of the Roman Empire came about. (Spoiler alert: spending wildly on a military it could not afford and spreading its defense forces throughout an ever expanding ""kingdom"" until they were rife for attack. Considering we scan only [4.1% of all the cargo that comes into our country](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-08-13/u-s-backs-off-all-cargo-scanning-goal-with-inspections-at-4-), and have two of the largest unsecured borders in the world, perhaps having a greater number of our military here, or perhaps focus some of our enormous defense budget on domestic security, rather than global policing (read: destabilizing regions where we want political influence -- [see Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Iraq, Costa Rica, Syria, Israel/Palestine, Iran, etc. etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions) )

So yeah... this is barely scratching the surface of the actual solutions, but i honestly think you probably are under the impression that progressive ideology is all a crock of magical, utopian bullshit. Its not. These policies have been thought up by some of the most intelligent people of our time and have been implemented on smaller scales successfully. Much of this atomization of society where we refuse to take care of our neighbors and fellow citizens is ""cutting off the nose to spite the face"" in that it often costs MORE to ignore these issues than address them head on and pay upfront. Things are extremely messed up in this country but fixing this tangled cord requires patience and critical thinking. Lowering taxes and de-regulating industry isnt going to save us this time. There is no oil boom and we arent the only economy left in the world because the rest were reduced to rubble (post WW2 recovery). Basically, it appears that the only way we will get through this impending economic depression is *together*..",7,0,1441827244,1444731210
cuvyakb,0,t1_cuvxlo2,VanGoghingSomewhere,"you might write me off for asking, but does bernie factor abortions into the infant mortality rate? i assume you see a stark difference between a fetus and an infant, but in recent years, in certain demographics, more babies have been killed by abortion than born. i don't think he cares about cutting back on those numbers. but boy! what a bleeding heart with solid morals and steadfast beliefs about holding the people together",-3,0,1441828263,1444731214
cuw0bei,0,t1_cuvyakb,itstriche,"I won't write you off for asking, but the sarcasm doesn't help your case as being the bastion of reason that you think you are. Firstly, Bernie isn't responsible for the IMR statistics, [that would be the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/infantmortality.htm). And no, they don't include abortions because infant mortality rate is used to determine what infants are dying unintentionally due to environmental causes/birth defects (in some cases, environment BEING the cause of the birth defects -- i.e. leaded gasoline, second hand smoke, etc.) 

For arguments sake, I will assume you believe life begins at conception since you seem put off that he believes in the individual liberty of a woman's right to choose what to do with her body. A quick google search for the claim that more babies are aborted than born returns alot of sources like Breitbart and The Federalist Papers, and very few that are trusted or known for impartial journalism. I am not surprised that the ""certain demographics"" these articles seem to focus on are minorities and people of color (non-hispanic blacks, and hispanics) and use these statistics to somehow insinuate that this is race related and not a poverty issue (couldn't find the actually study but would love to see the method used in calculating what is considered an abortion -- e.g. taking Plan B vs partial birth abortion). Whether or not you ""think"" he cares about cutting back these numbers is irrelevant to the facts, and a [quick google search could have provided you with all of these answers and more.](http://www.bustle.com/articles/80644-bernie-sanders-stance-on-abortion-is-exactly-what-youd-expect-from-the-progressive-candidate)

He, foremost, stands up for the rights of the women to choose over the rights of the unborn child (given that it is her body, and her baby). However, he, like I, would prefer that the women just NOT have an unwanted pregnancy in the first place:

>Rather than focusing on the issue of abortion, Sanders places his attention on prevention, education, and the accessibility of contraception. 

... something that christians and conservatives simply cannot seem to understand. Abstinence DOES NOT WORK for everyone and contraception is a proven method to reducing the amount of unwanted pregnancies. However, the unfortunate circumstances do arise where a woman cannot reasonably expect to carry and raise a child while impoverished. I always found it funny how the second the baby is born, this whole argument about ""protecting the baby"" seems to fall apart. You'd rather this baby be born into a family where it will be neglected or starve to death? Where an older sibling has to raise the child because the mother is working two jobs just to support the one that already is there? Or are there no circumstances you can wrap your mind around where these things might not just be as simple as ""kill the child or not kill the child""? I would gander to say that probably 99% of the women who go through this are embarrassed, ashamed, and left emotionally scarred by the experience of having to make the responsible decision to have a baby when she can properly raise it, rather than to further dig themselves and their future child into a life neither of them want. The fact that child services in inner cities are so poorly funded and yet you have these religious zealots clamoring on and on about abortion when there is so much to do about the *already alive children living among us*, just goes to show how selective people are about their beliefs. Leave the sick, poor, and hungry children to die in the streets, but god forbid someone is allowed to make a decision about their own personal health and well being that goes against a portion of the population's religious beliefs. The argument is nonsensical. Fund contraception and planned parenthood **properly** and you will see abortion rates go down, like they are in affluent areas of NYC.

Saying that taking the right to have a fetus aborted away from a woman is telling her what she can't do with her body is like saying the government can't tell a woman she's not allowed to wipe her butt. It has nothing to do with the mother's body, that adage is such baloney. When an infant is born, it isn't considered the mother's body, and she most definitely is not allowed to kill it. While it's being internally nurtured and prepared for infancy though? Oh that's just part of her body let her get rid of it if she likes. It's *her* body.",-1,0,1441834906,1444731214

As opposed to what? You or someone else having that authority? Arguing with people like you is what concerns me about the American public. So much ignorance paired with so little empathy. Considering the fetus is only made possible by the fertilized egg of the woman it is inside, yeah, I'd say until it can exist on its own outside of her body, it is most definitely *part* of her body. And the supreme court agrees, considering Roe v Wade was over 50 years ago and is upheld to this day. So maybe instead of being butthurt and spouting the bullshit talking points you heard on Fox News in some failed attempt to be clever, actually do some research and maybe cite some sources for your wildly ignorant and inaccurate 'beliefs'. There are plenty of valid reasons to get an abortion, not the least of which that you are not equipped to properly raise the child. We have enough people in this world already who got fucked up as kids and now take it out on society.
