3ncnnq,"To the (seemingly few) Redditors who don't support sanders, why not?",113,obeetwo2,"I used to be pretty into politics, but since moving to a university I haven't had cable and just don't pay attention to the news anymore. I tend to vote republican, but like I said I haven't been paying as much attention to politics. Bernie sanders has described himself as a socialist. Which, at its core, I disagree with, but he does have good ideas, he wants to deprivatize prisons, legalize non harmful drugs and, even as a republican I feel pharmaceutical drugs should be a little more regulated. 

What is it that stops you from voting for sanders?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ncnnq/to_the_seemingly_few_redditors_who_dont_support/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443886432,1444719607
