3nknlm,"If you had to run a presidential debate, how would you choose the candidates?",25,Ytoabn,"Inspired by this [Politico Article](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/polls-2016-gop-accuracy-214373) on how pollsters don't appreciate being used to narrow the field, I started thinking how I would choose the candidates for a debate if I wasn't allowed to use the polls. The only reasonable criteria I could think of was some kind of letter writing campaign. Voters registered to the party that was having a primary debate would have to write in and declare who they wanted to see on the stage. This would at least give you some idea of who had the most active supporters and organized campaign.
