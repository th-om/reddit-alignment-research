Well, it's a subjective moral judgement, so we do.

>who benefits?

Anybody who wanted them dead... and probably a few people in Vegas (they'll let you bet on pretty much anything).

That being said, I think a lot of people deserve to die. I just don't trust any person or institution (including myself) to actually carry it out. Institutions are made of humans and are therefore fallible. ",1,0,1443169981,1444724377

The state has the power to condemn people to death, thank to the monopoly of violence. A state which cannot do so cannot really be called a state.

The death penalty to me is thus a demonstration of the reality of the state's power, and to abolish the death penalty is to deny that reality. As I like to observe, even the Norwegians ended up shooting Quisling. ",4,0,1443139368,1444724377

A state, for the sake of moral grandstanding, may claim that it does not have the power to condemn people to death. But the reality is that it does by the nature of its power over violence. And that power over violence exists both in handling external enemies of the state as well as internal enemies like criminals which threaten the state's authority over law.

Absolutely. If someone has taken a life they themselves have just acted on the idea that other people's lives don't matter and therefore deserve to be victims of the perspective they initially acted upon.

>If someone murders children in cold blood, and in a sane state of mind, does he deserve to die?

Sure. There's actually no good reason for an individual like that to be alive. We need to set precedents in order to deter people from certain behaviors. A huge deterrent for people with the desire to murder is the idea that they will be losing their lives if they do so.

There's the argument to be made that the death penalty should not exist because of potential to convict innocents, but do you believe that certain criminals deserve to die?
