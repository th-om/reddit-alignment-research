 not a bunch of isolated societies living within one country. 

When the quote used as the title is pulled out it makes it sound like he wants everyone to ""act white"" and frowns on people speaking other languages, especially when paired with the headline ""jeb bush thinks multiculturalism is wrong"". 

> But Bush said later he viewed multiculturalism as not aspiring to an American ideal. ""You have to have people assimilate into society. But that doesn't mean we have a monolithic, homogeneous population. To the contrary,"" he told The Associated Press before headlining a legislative fundraiser in Cedar Rapids.

To just say ""jeb thinks multiculturalism is wrong.

Tbe way I see it he's not asking anyone to abandon their own cultural heritage but rather to embrace certain American values and to adapt to America so that they may be better equipped to succeed. 

For example, speaking spanish at home but being able to speak english at work (as jeb and his family do themselves). Its accepting of other cultures but acknowledges the reality that you are limiting yourself if you can only speak spanish. You are also limiting yourself if you can only speak english but it's significantly less of an impediment to success in the US than not speaking english.

This is more or less what happened in the 19th century and early 20th century with European/Asian immigrants. That's why you have Chinatowns and little Italies all across American cities: they are legacies of ethnic enclaves within the United States.

The thing with this is that even if first generation immigrants are insulated and stay ""Indian"" (as an example), their kids are not gonna stay that way. Kids are going to be bombarded with American pop culture and want to join in to be cool. Even in India you get exposed to American pop culture lots and lots and the effects are going to be order of magnitudes greater if you live in America. Everybody young is going to want to speak english to get access to more opportunities in life. You are going to be exposed to a lot of mainstream culture/society because there's probably going to be a non-Indian neighborhood 20 minutes walk from where you live and young people rarely wants to stay where they grew up forever.

Basically this has being done before by immigrant groups, the end result is that it always breaks down in a generation or two because the kids are going to be more American than whatever else.",6,0,1443131134,1444724552

You can't, I don't think parents are even able to shield their kids from American pop culture in urban India/China.

The other big reason is because you have to learn english to get more job opportunities. If you want to work in a Chinese/Indian grocery store all your life then you don't need to learn english.
