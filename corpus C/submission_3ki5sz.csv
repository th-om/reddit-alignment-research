3ki5sz,To the Democrats who are salivating over the possibility of Donald Trump winning the Republican Nomination,337,INTELLECTUAL_FETUS,"To those people that think Trump being the Republican presidential candidate would mean an easy win for the democrats: I got news for you. Listen closely to what Trump says beyond his nativist and belligerent rants. He wants to ""renegotiate"" trade deals, imposing import taxes to keep jobs in america, raising taxes on ultrawealthy people to pay for middle class tax cuts, massive spending on infrastructure and healthcare, and a massive increase in military spending. On top of this, he rails against the practice of the ultra wealthy buying politicians. These are all highly popular positions, ESPECIALLY with the democratic base. If you think Trump can't woo democratic voters because hes too abrasive and divisive, ask yourself if that laid off, blue collared democratic voter would relate more to Trump, or would they relate more to Clinton or Sanders? Trump is a lot of things, but he's no joke.
