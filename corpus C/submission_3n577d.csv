3n577d,How to deal with Regulations?,19,werthecrystalgeminis,"Too much bureaucracy and red tape is naturally a burden on growth and especially harsh on smaller firms, but an untamed free market is not particularly safe. How do we prevent regulatory capture without throwing common sense out the window? Are we supposed to fight our way through the 900 bazillion pages of regulations we've already passed and decide which ones should go? Do you think there's a better system out there of holding firms accountable for their actions than our current one? I'm just interested in what people have to say on the subject.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3n577d/how_to_deal_with_regulations/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443730261,1444720846
