I hope $0 counts as a living wage, because that's what all the people his $15 minimum wage would put out of work will be making.

> Anyone who works 40 hours a week should have the right to be a home owner, drive a nice car, put food on the table, take vacations, etc.

None of those, other than food, are rights.  They're privileges.  The sheer level of entitlement required to claim that driving a ""nice car"" is a right is staggering.

> Sanders has done more to advance Civil Rights then any other politician serving in the Senate. He's marched with MLK

> He voted against the war... He's against war, especially endless war to fund Halliburton and keep the oil companies rich. He's pro peace. 

Which war? Iraq? Yeah, he voted against it, but then he voted to fund it three times and was only in favor of a gradual drawdown of troops.  Aside from that, [he has a long and storied history of being hawkish on foreign policy.](http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/07/27/bernie-sanders-savior-or-seducer-of-the-anti-war-left/)  He's known as ""Bernie the Bomber"" for a reason.

No, it won't.  It will cost trillions, raise the tax burden on the lower and middle classes, and add to the towering deficit.  The concept of stealing from future generations to fund social programs now is not original, unique, practical, or moral.

> He's the only candidate for college students. My tuition is $60,000 a year. Under Bernie it would be completely subsidized by the government.

Government subsidies are the reason why your tuition is so high.  The student loan racket has removed any incentive for colleges and universities to charge a tuition that the average person can afford.  They know they'll get their money no matter what, so why would they ever voluntarily decrease their prices under the current system? 

""But isn't that money going towards higher-quality education?"" you ask.  The answer is a resounding no.  It goes to useless Gender Studies and Underwater Basketweaving programs, even more useless administrators with bullshit job titles, and campus amenities like shiny new dining halls and gyms.

Education will never be ""free"" - your choices are free-market education, government-sponsored debt slavery, or oppressive taxation.  I know which option I'd rather have.

No candidate is ""owned"" by donors.  The supporting data for claims of this type of influence has been zero.

The lack of support Sanders gets from those classes, however, should be troubling, as business interests are what drives this economy.

> He supports a real living wage. Anyone who works 40 hours a week should have the right to be a home owner, drive a nice car, put food on the table, take vacations, etc.

A living wage does not confer any rights on anyone.  Anyone who works 40 hours already has the right to do those things, you'd just prefer they have the means.  Unfortunately, basic economics tell us that a ""living wage"" will price a large number of people out of jobs entirely, create inflation issues, and is largely a moving target depending on where one lives.  A living wage in New York City is different than a living wage in the midwest, and Bernie Sanders shows no understanding of that difference.

> Sanders has done more to advance Civil Rights then any other politician serving in the Senate. He's marched with MLK, sponsored pro-gay rights legislation since the 90's, and was the first politician to openly support trans rights. He understands why women would like to see a woman in office but confidently points to his own record on women's rights issues that is second to none.

There are dozens of people in the Senate, and plenty of people running, who have similarly excellent civil rights records on both sides of the aisle.  Bernie Sanders should be commended for being on board early, but he's not unique.

> He voted against the war. 

Good for him.  The war is over, and leaving early created a worse situation as a result.

The 2016 election is not a litmus test on a war from 13 years ago.

> He's against war, especially endless war to fund Halliburton and keep the oil companies rich. He's pro peace.

No one is ""pro-war,"" it's just a largely different mindset as to attain peace.  Many, myself included, see ""peace through superior firepower"" as an option.  ""Peaceful"" solutions to ISIS aren't going to work unless we just let ISIS run rampant and murder millions as a result.  Sanders refuses to acknowledge the unique position the United States holds on the world stage and would rather the middle eastern citizens of those nations be held hostage by that extremist group.

If you're ""pro-peace,"" you should be rejecting that outright.

Also, wars don't exist to keep oil companies rich.  They exist to keep people from dying at the hands of brutal regimes when we get involved.

> He's the only candidate who has never wavered from his belief on single payer healthcare.

A foolish proposition far out of step with the nation he would like to govern.

> His economic plans will save most tax payers a lot of money while providing a better life, including free healthcare and actual living wages.

The health care would not be free, it would need to be paid in taxes.  This means that we'd have to see ""most"" tax payers (remember, 47% or so of people have no federal income tax burden, and about 20-25% or so have no federal tax burden period) paying *more* in taxes if Bernie Sanders was to somehow get his agenda passed through Congress.

> He's the only candidate for college students. My tuition is $60,000 a year. Under Bernie it would be completely subsidized by the government. 

Sanders's college plan is only for public universities, and only for tuition.  His plan is untenable in the long term because of the lack of cost controls, the way subsidies provide adverse outcomes (as we've seen from the massive college price inflation following subsidized student loans), and the watering down of the four year college degree.  The feel good ""free college!"" aspect would be far overshadowed by what it would do to the overall college results in this country.

> . My generation is the future of this nation and saddling us with unreasonable debt while we pursue our dreams is clearly a bad idea. 

If your dream is to get a poetry degree while going to a $60,000/year college (and this is a general you), there's no reason why a taxpayer should be supporting you in that.  Some degrees are worth a six figure investment, others are not.  Bernie Sanders's college plan ignores that stark, cold reality of life.

> Bernie is pro-immigration. He recognizes this country was founded by immigrants and we need to be more accepting and accommodating to modern day immigrants.

This isn't even true.  Bernie Sanders thinks immigrants are stealing jobs of Americans and drives down their wages.  He's completely backwards on this issue.

> I can't believe the GOP is actually making this an issue but Bernie supports science.

Bernie Sanders supports GMO labeling.  He once wrote in a newspaper article that orgasms can prevent cervical cancer.  Bernie Sanders isn't pro-science, he's just pro-science he likes.
