3nk9bk,On the consequences of gun control,12,fizolof,"Mass shootings are always committed by a person who is in a terrible place, mentally. No healthy, satisfied person wants to kill a bunch of people just for the hell of it.

If we take away guns, that will make it more difficult for them to commit mass murders, however it won't change their mood - they'll still feel terrible, just unable to do much about it.

Therefore, wouldn't one argument against gun control be that if we took away people's guns, we would have less incentive to make sure others are okay? Right now, people might care more about the mental well-being of others, for the fear that they might shoot up schools. Without guns, people would be less inclined to care about others.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nk9bk/on_the_consequences_of_gun_control/,PoliticalDiscussion,1444043650,1444718546
