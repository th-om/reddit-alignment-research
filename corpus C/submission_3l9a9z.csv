3l9a9z,"Who impressed you as the most SUBSTANTIVE speaker in the recent debate, whether or not you agreed with them?",15,Deggit,"I think this debate finally exposed Trump's content-free bluster but who was the ***MOST detailed and policy-oriented debater tonight?***

This debate was largely a trainwreck with CNN's questions typically just telling Candidate A that Candidate B recently criticized them and asking them to respond. There were very few questions on policy.

Here is my scorecard - keep in mind I am a liberal, and **I want to hear what conservatives think.**

--------

My scorecard:

**The Not Ready For Prime Times - Trump, Carson**

 Trump blustered and Carson stammered, both of them were revealed to be empty of detail, nuance and policy ideas. Trump barely mentioned any names or facts during this debate, often referring to ""great people"" or ""many people."" Carson had one good moment talking detail about immigration but elsewhere he was constantly reduced to simply commenting on others' ideas.

**The Forgot You Were Heres - Huckabee, Kasich, Paul**

They barely spoke in the first hour and did not make a dent. I've always liked Huckabee's sense of humor and he wins my Have A Beer With primary.

----

**The Unremarkables - Walker, Bush**

They gave relatively standard, blah conservative performances that did nothing to wow the crowd, win spontaneous applause or stand out from all the OTHER generic conservatives on the stage.

I feel that Bush is the **HUGE AND TOTAL LOSER** (as a certain candidate would say) of this debate. I simply cannot picture Bush's donors looking at tonight with confidence. Bush lived up to many voters' first impression that he simply doesn't have the passion and fire they are looking for and he barely did ANYTHING to differentiate himself from Walker, much less Rubio and Fiorina. **At times Bush was almost a nonentity** in this debate, being asked to comment fourth or fifth instead of jumping into the thick of things.

**The New Contenders - Top tier: Rubio and Fiorina; B-Tier: Cruz and Christie**
---

**Rubio** was immensely detailed and policy oriented. For example he broadened the illegal immigration discussion to also talking about reforming our LEGAL immigration system to reward merit instead of family relation. When he talked about foreign policy he had a clear grasp of geopolitical strategy, he was the only candidate on the stage to even mention NATO although Fiorina also alluded to it. **My favorite Rubio moment in the debate** was when a moderator asked him if he though Trump was uninformed on foreign policy and Rubio replied ""Why don't you ask Trump a foreign policy question and see?"" (implied: ""Instead of asking us to attack each other""). The only problem Rubio had was he often sounded younger than 40 especially when he got excited.

**Fiorina** was pretty vicious in this debate. She talked all over the moderators and candidates but got herself a lot of airtime. She clearly got the best of her several back-and-forths with Trump. She put on a strained performance to spout as many factoids as possible especially about the military and foreign policy as if to reassure viewers that she knows enough to be CinC. I felt that Fiorina was utterly unlikable but seemed strong and resolute.

**Christie** dug himself out of his grave in this debate if you ask me. He showed himself to be personable, he talked about his record and generally made a good impression that made me think ""Why has this guy been counted out already?""

**Cruz** is the one that's hard to judge. I think a lot of the Cruz vote is following Trump right now. But I think people are also paying attention to the fact that Cruz CONSISTENTLY staked out his ground as THE most conservative candidate and the one who had been taking the fight to the Dems. Cruz is the Bachmann of this cycle and is due for a bump, I reckon.
