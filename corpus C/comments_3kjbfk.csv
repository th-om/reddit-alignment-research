Alzheimers doesn't affect all elderly people, and Reagan/Sanders aren't so much older than Biden/Clinton that the chances skyrocket. It's very unlikely that a person would be able to run for office and then, out of nowhere, be senile. Much more likely that absolutely anyone in office over 50 would get a heart attack or something. 

Also, here are some Alzheimers facts:

* Only 2.9% of white Americans between 65-74 have Alzheimers.

* That percentage grows by just 8% in the next 11 years of life. 

* 2-in-3 people with Alzheimer’s are women. (Alzheimer’s Association)

* African American and Hispanic Americans are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s than white Americans. (Alzheimer’s Association)

It's a low-blow to suggest that someone is going to become senile in office when it's such a low chance and there's no reason to think he has a high likelihood of it. It's not like he's going to choose Michael Moore as his running mate, either. I think we can relax a little on the McCain/Palin comparisons. ",1,0,1442195578,1444730116

cuzr6pe,1,t3_3kjbfk,Mrs_Frisby,">Just a thought - I've heard very little criticism of Sanders for being so elderly.

You've heard very little criticism of him for anything because nobody takes him seriously as a candidate outside his pep squad.  He has, effectively, never been vetted.

For example, did you know that Bernie [really hates nuclear power](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/nuclear-power) and generally is bad on environmental issues?  Hardcore conservationists do not like him and love Hillary.  

> Sanders also questioned why the federal government sinks billions of dollars into federal subsidies for the nuclear industry. With a $15 trillion national debt, he  questioned subsidies like taxpayer-backed insurance for major disasters and $18.5 billion in loan guarantees for nuclear plants. 

>""When it comes to taxpayer support for nuclear power there is no end in sight,"" Sanders said.

Nuclear power is so much better than coal - which [also emits radiation btw - Coal ash is more radioactive than nuclear waste](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/).  But Bernie is a scared old man who hears nuclear and thinks Chernobyl and goes all NIMBY on it.  Clinton, meanwhile, lets scientists guide her environmental policy instead of fear.

Bernie also believer that injecting colloidal silver into your blood stream can cure cancer and thinks the scamming quacks who do it should be allowed to get state licenses to practice ""Naturopathy"" as ""alternative medicine"" even though that shit is worse than homeopathy because at least homeopathy does nothing at all.  [Naturopathy actively poisons it's patients](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/legislative-alchemy-revisited-naturopathy-in-vermont-and-colloidal-silver/).

>I recently learned that Vermont licenses naturopaths, NDs, as physicians and that they have a state sanctioned formulary, a list of drugs they can prescribe and administer to patients. To my horror, the 2009 formulary includes “colloidal silver preparations” to treat eye infections and “silver” which they can administer intravenously.

> I was horrified because of the danger this poses to patients, the incredible ignorance it shows on the part of naturopaths, and because NDs had, without my knowledge, been licensed in Vermont to administer prescription drugs and other strange substances like silver and tin, do physical exams and order the same diagnostic tests that MDs order.

>Colloidal silver is nonsense. There’s no evidence that it is good for anything. Rosemary also revealed to me something I didn’t know before, namely that there’s another woo-friendly Senator that I didn’t really know about: Bernie Sanders

Bernie sanders supported legislation to allow untrained idiots pretend to be doctors in Vermont, and even held a symposium in Washington to preach to his fellow legislators about how awesome quack medicine is.  **[From Sanders own website](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/events/2010/10/16/complementary-and-alternative-health-care-conference)**:

> Join Bernie at a free day-long conference where you can learn about acupuncture, massage, stress reduction, chiropractic care, **naturopathic medicine**, and other complementary and alternative health care modalities.

He is anti-science.  Which is fine when he happens to be right about something but becomes a problem when he is objectively wrong and won't admit it.",0,0,1442120865,1444730120
