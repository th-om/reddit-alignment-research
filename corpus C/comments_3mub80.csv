Did I say I did? What I'm saying is that there is no intellectual value added by showing a video of an abortion. Everyone agrees that it is an unpleasant procedure. But so are most medical procedures. But that holds no bearing on whether or not the procedure should be legal. The **only** purpose of showing such a video is a direct appeal to emotion; to elicit a guttural, knee-jerk reaction.

> I think showing everyone what you are for would be telling too much about you.

That I am for women having the freedom to choose whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term, within some reasonable restrictions (such as late-term abortions or superficial reasons, like gender)? Again, showing such a video adds nothing to the debate of intellectual value. All it would do is further cement the views of anti-abortionists, basically preaching directly to the choir. Furthermore, most of those videos (as produced by anti-abortion groups) provide no context for the footage--they just show a dead fetus and go ""Oh the horrors of abortion!"" They don't tell you *why* the fetus was aborted--it could have had a life-threatening illness, severe birth defects, could have endangered the life of the mother, could have been the product of rape or incest, etc. Hell, sometimes the videos aren't even of aborted fetus. For example, the video Carly Fiorina referenced during the recent GOP presidential debate was debunked repeatedly--the footage wasn't from Planned Parenthood and wasn't even an abortion; it was footage of a stillborn baby that was edited into an anti-abortion video. All for the emotional reaction it would elicit.

I'm not denying that abortions are an unpleasant procedure. But footage of abortions don't add any real, intellectual value to the debate over abortions. Such footage is solely for an appeal to emotion, and largely just serves to recommit the positions of those *already* against abortion. There's nothing to be gained.",2,0,1443557354,1444722297

If the images upset you I ask you to consider why that is and reconsider your stance.

But hiding from these images is just hiding from the truth and you are not helping yourself that way.",0,0,1443551584,1444722301
cvi97l0,1,t3_3mub80,mrhymer,"No. The Right lost this debate when they allowed the Left to skip a step. We went from abortion illegal to ""since we have decided to intervene in a healthy pregnancy when does life begin?"" 

The Right should have been like, ""Whoa! slow down. We are not there yet. We have got to have the discussion about whether we should intervene in a healthy pregnancy.""",-4,0,1443546038,1444722304

cvjchff,0,t1_cvjc4of,mrhymer,"The entire abortion debate for the last 4 decades has been a discussion about the point in a healthy pregnancy where intervention should happen or ""when does life begin"".  The intervention is a given moral and legal acceptance despite the fact that one side is arguing that life begins at inception. The idea that a few cells is life is ridiculous. The idea that a healthy pregnancy that is not interfered with will result in a life is a scientific fact.",1,0,1443626217,1444722304
