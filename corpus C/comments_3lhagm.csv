cv6bpiq,1,t3_3lhagm,Drexelhand,"> It is theorized that in the early 1990s, the sudden drop in crime rate was attributed to the Roe v. Wade. Namely, the first generation of high risk teenagers were never born.

Number of abortion has been falling and crime continues to fall, there isn't a strong correlation. It's an interesting pet theory, but [there are a lot of pet theories](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/07/economist-explains-16), [some much better supported](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21582004-crime-plunging-rich-world-keep-it-down-governments-should-focus-prevention-not). There doesn't appear to be a consensus on any one factor.",6,0,1442612098,1444726888
cv6dk4m,1,t3_3lhagm,Precursor2552,"This has been taught numerous times as bad statistical work to me.

Of particular concern is that abortion was leaglised in the US, but the drop in crime wasn't limited to the US. I've heard a few explanations from just general economic improvement, to the use of unleaded gasoline (my personal favorite). ",6,0,1442615468,1444726888
cv6doki,1,t3_3lhagm,evanb_,"It's an interesting social science article but I don't think it bears any relevance to the political discussion surrounding abortion bans.

Opponents of abortion aren't going to consider whether or not abortion is a utilitarian good. There were economic arguments that suggested slavery was a utilitarian good. But for the opponents, these are both issues of individual human rights, not what's best for society.",4,0,1442615692,1444726888
cv72wd8,0,t1_cv6doki,qi1,"Exactly.

Even if the correlation is true, a simple pro-life response is this: Why not just round up every impoverished and unwanted three-year-old child growing up in the United States and kill each of them, one by one, to prevent them growing up becoming high risk teenagers and criminals?

Can't do that because you can't kill a human being? If the unborn are also human beings you can't justify abortion to reduce crime.",0,0,1442684493,1444726888
cv6e3he,1,t3_3lhagm,TelescopeFeed,More persuasive is the [lead-crime hypothesis](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline).  Which would mean that the [EPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead#History) is responsible for decline in crime (and increase in our collective IQ).  Something to think about (young libertarians).,2,0,1442616480,1444726888
cv6aus8,1,t3_3lhagm,Measure76,"Makes sense logically, and was well backed by statistics. 

To re-investigate now might be impossible, because there's no other country quite like ours, and the going from illegal to legal abortions isn't likely to happen again here. 

Still, it's quite possible more studies have been carried out that supports or undermines the findings, unfortunately I'm not aware of any.",4,0,1442610644,1444726888
cv6b2zt,0,t1_cv6aus8,iuseoxyclean,"Yeah I'm having difficulty finding any opposing data either. I for one am against abortions but honestly it wouldn't be my place to say.

One thing I would ask though is this: How much productivity do you think it would have cost if abortions were still illegal? Thinking in terms of this: How many teenagers never get an education or gainful employment because they have to raise a kid? How many kids grow up as orphans or in poverty because they were unwanted and unaffordable? How many advances in medical technology do you think we made from the stem cells they've been able to harvest from these fetuses?",1,0,1442611029,1444726892
cv6b7td,0,t1_cv6b2zt,Measure76,"Probably a lot of productivity. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the mother's productivity went up from having an abortion nearly immediately.

But how against abortions are you? Imagine a 15 year old girl raped and impregnated by her uncle. Do you force her to have a child and have to mentally, phsyically, and financially support the product of that rape for the next 18 years, or do you have a little bit of compassion here and allow the abortion?",1,0,1442611252,1444726892
cv6buz6,0,t1_cv6b7td,iuseoxyclean,"In a sense that abortions are awful - there's no other side to that. If my girlfriend got pregnant today I would say whatever I could to convince her not to but in the end I respect that I have no say in it.

I'm also willing to acknowledge the terrifying existence of coat hanger abortions and I would much rather give women a safe avenue of options, even if it costs my tax dollars.",1,0,1442612364,1444726892
cv6dx0h,0,t1_cv6buz6,Measure76,I'm even totally with you that abortions are awful. Outlawing them just happens to be worse.,1,0,1442616131,1444726892
cv6brvz,1,t3_3lhagm,Dennis_Wangley,"People like to use the code words, but everyone knows that by ""impoverished"" you really mean black. You are trying to say that the more black babies get aborted, the less crime there is. 

I guess that actually was Margaret Sanger's stated goal when she started Planned Parenthood, so Mission Accomplished, I guess. ",2,0,1442612214,1444726892
