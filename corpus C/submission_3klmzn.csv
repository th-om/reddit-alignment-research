3klmzn,Why aren't the other GOP candidates as accessible to the media as Trump?,14,garfangle,"Pundits say that a significant reason why Donald Trump has become the front runner in the Republican field is because he has gotten more attention by the media than the other candidates combined. Almost every political story is about Trump attacking someone, making hyperbolic statements, and what the GOP Establishment is doing about it. When the other candidates get in the news it is often in response to a Trump remark about them or his twitter feed.

However, I am sure that any of the top ten candidates could get booked on any political show they wanted to, yet they are so far reluctant to do so. Moreover, unlike Trump who is willing to call in to any news show, the rest of the field carefully arranges how and when they get interviewed. The reason for this caution is because the candidate often has a specific message they want to get out to the media and doesn't want any other news event to distract them from their talking points, unlike Trump who is willing to opine on any topic of the day.

If you want to beat the front runner, you don't necessarily have to engage with Trump, but you do have to make yourself as accessible to the media as him.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3klmzn/why_arent_the_other_gop_candidates_as_accessible/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442010996,1444729837
