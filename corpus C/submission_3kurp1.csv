3kurp1,What is the purpose of a corporate tax?,31,,"I just heard America has the highest coorporate tax rate in the world. In my mind, it seems to have only downsides. A low corporate tax incentivizes business to move to and stay in America. A high one means they have less money to expand and hire new employees. Basically, it seems like the downsides of an increased minimum wage (hurting small businesses, decreasing the number of jobs companies can support) without the upside (increased wages). 

So what is the point of it? I don't know much about economics, so I could be missing something. It seems to me that if you want to ""fight income inequality"" or just need more tax revenue it would make sense to put more taxes on the wealthy people benefiting from the coorporations (whose money will likely not go back into creating jobs, like the coorporate wealth would).
