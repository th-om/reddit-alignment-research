One concern is that the capital required to fund the demolition account would be much better off put to some productive use in the meantime.

This is the same problem with most schemes to fully fund highly uncertain future expenses.",4,0,1442340900,1444728144
cv2ol7a,0,t1_cv2l5a2,EasterTheBunny,"Sure. We would have to weigh the detriment of having either inactive structures or inactive capital. I think this solution would decrease initial investment on new property development or make division and or rezoning more efficient. The layout of population density and zoning necessities of entire cities can be altered simply by the placement of a major highway. A commercial district can more easily transform into a residential district and vice versa with clean land. So the question again is can land use efficiency be more valuable than active capital?

You can also measure the effect of having certain sums of money reserved for blue collar sectors. It's a situation where you we know that x amount of money will be dumped into the lower tier of the economic ladder at some point in the future. If we need to reboot the economy, we can just start demolishing buildings. Haha!",0,0,1442346005,1444728144

cv2ozcv,0,t1_cv2nudu,EasterTheBunny,"The property is worth more with no structure on it, so yes we would be injecting value into the property by requiring demolition. However, the value of improved property is dependent on the structure's state of disrepair. So you get a state of limbo where a building spends enough time for it to pass the point of no return where it's cheaper to demolish than repair. The scope of the problem grows when entire neighborhoods or business districts succumb to a drastic change in population movement. These areas end up requiring such massive investments to undertake the entire project that few investors or opportunities come up to take it on. If small portions of these areas can be leveled before the scope of the issue reaches massive proportions, investment opportunities can open up in much smaller chunks allowing the free hand of the market and all that to be more effective.",0,0,1442346576,1444728147

I feel like you're trying to treat a symptom rather than a problem.  The reason that properties go derelict is because they're no longer desirable.  Demolishing that building only makes development slightly cheaper, it doesn't make it desirable.  

Look at it this way.  Imagine an entire town has been abandoned (it happens more than you'd think).  You could demolish all the now-useless buildings there, even build up new ones.  But if you don't look at the reasons why the town was abandoned in the first place (say, the local coal mine dried up), then all you've done is built a new town in the middle of nowhere that no one wants to live in.

cv2qjru,0,t1_cv2puk4,EasterTheBunny,"I think we could both agree that your example is a fringe case where this solution has no application. The city has no interest in rebuilding as the city itself is abandoned. Regardless of demolition, no new development will move into the area.

Sure having reserving the funds for demolition is just shifting money around, but it control in the hands of the interested party. The city has interest in removing an unused, unusable or condemned building because these structures attract homelessness, crime, fires, etc. and large swathes of abandoned buildings require large sums of investment capital rebuild on. One task of any municipality is to design and direct development. Anything that contributes to offsetting the market's limiting factors is beneficial to that goal.",1,0,1442348834,1444728147

If the land owner doesn't obey the law, they are fined. If fines are not paid, a lean is put on the property. If that doesn't do the trick, the municipality eventually takes ownership of the property and auctions it off to the highest bidder who would be responsible for remediating the property. 

The problem is that citizens tend not to pay a lot of attention to local zoning laws so the laws are written to benefit developers. If more community members participated in local governance, there'd be a lot fewer vacant buildings on the landscape. ",1,0,1442347785,1444728147
