cv5jtj8,1,t3_3le603,TheNaBr,Trump never says anything...he replies with a non-reply.  Nothing will come of it.  All the controversy is attached to the guy asking the question.,5,0,1442550828,1444727273
cv5r9ln,1,t3_3le603,littlebitsoffluff,"This is a complete non-issue. Some crazy dude stands up in the middle of a forum and asks what is at most a racist question and at least just embarrassing. Trump gives him a response which every person in the room with a clue interprets as ""Huh-huh, right buddy, yeah we'll get right on that"" and quickly moves on. There is more slander against religions and races committed here on Reddit in a minute than what happened here. But the press picks it up because it might be sensational--which they should, it's their job. But it will be greeted by a big ho-hum.

After all, TRUMP didn't say those words. It's like blaming Jodie Foster for John Lennon's killing. ",6,0,1442577791,1444727273
cv5wv3m,0,t1_cv5r9ln,FlyingFistsOfFury,"Yeah, I hate Trump with the intensity of a thousand exploding suns but I can't fault him too much for this. ",1,0,1442588933,1444727273
cv62pkp,0,t1_cv5wv3m,littlebitsoffluff,I'm not very keen on him either. ,1,0,1442597813,1444727273
cv5rf9f,1,t3_3le603,Fozzz,This wasn't even the nuttiest question at that rally.  That award goes to the lady with the dreams of a Christian Holocaust.  ,3,0,1442578245,1444727273
cv5l5wa,1,t3_3le603,yabbadabbadoo1,"Yeah him avoiding the question and making a joke about something like that being the first question has no chance at hurting him. It's similar to the guy who got up and asked if they could do a joint press conference to talk about how his plant isn't safe (same guy gave him a question on it last month at another town hall).

Look you put 4000 of all kinds of people and some nut job will say something stupid. This isn't any different then a crazy feminist or some other fringe group, religious group or whatever asking a question like this. It was open questions, comes with the territory.",4,0,1442554398,1444727273
cv5kny1,1,t3_3le603,Sam_Munhi,"This will help him with his base. He's moved into phase 2 of his campaign, the ""I'm not saying, I'm just saying,"" phase.",3,0,1442552968,1444727273
cv5ri3u,1,t3_3le603,Quetzalcoatls,"I watched the comment live and apparently the media all got the same memo this morning to focus on this and take it out of context. Really pathetic actually how desperate the Media is to destroy Trump. Anderson Cooper was even forced to issue an apology on air last night before his show was even over after he literally lost his mind discussing this issue with a Trump guy lol. 

Donald Trump is looking into terrorist training camps. Your hate of Trump is making you hear what you want to hear lmao. Don't be such a partisan hack and think for yourself, not what the media tells you :) ",2,0,1442578469,1444727273
cv6b698,1,t3_3le603,Drexelhand,"When you're bucking for the crazy vote you don't tell them that they're just seeing things.

Trump probably could have gotten some voice of reason points for putting the kibosh on the inalfa olutionsa, but why bother when chasing an entirely different animal is working? From purely the perspective of staying on top, this was the smart move and I'm sure Trump had prepared for just such a situation.",1,0,1442611181,1444727273
cv5pg8e,1,t3_3le603,yankeesyes,"A lot of the GOP base really believes this and cheer this guy on.  Some more of the base doesn't believe in this but cheer the guy on because it ""sticks it to the libs.""  Trump however needs to stop this kind of rhetoric in its tracks- its uncivil and gives horrible people like that a voice in his campaign.

I don't think it will be his downfall, but if this kind of stuff continues its going to scare the middle off, those people who like him because he isn't a politician and ""has some good points.""",0,0,1442571448,1444727273
cv64wrz,1,t3_3le603,BoiseNTheHood,"His answer was basically the equivalent of ""that's nice, dear.""  Anyone with a brain who actually watched the clip would realize that he wasn't seriously advocating ethnic cleansing.  

It's ironic that the left is outraged about their taken-out-of-context version of the soundbyte when they worship FDR, who actually *did* round up Japanese-, Italian-, and German-Americans and put them in camps.",-2,0,1442601202,1444727273
