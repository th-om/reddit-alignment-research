A smaller, local operation is inherently more efficient than a larger, bureaucratic one.  You can read about some of the reasons for that in the link.  We can apply some of these to healthcare, specifically.  There are obvious concerns with inertia, isolation of decision makers from results of their decisions, slow response time, and inelasticity of supply (think antibiotic and vaccine shortages, for example).

Absolutely. Take single payer healthcare for instance. AFAIK Vermont is the only state to have tried a single payer system, and it failed miserably while not even covering everyone. Imagine the piles of human debris that would have accumulated had this been applied to everyone.

While it is arguable that Norway or Sweden or <insert your favorite social democracy here> have self sustaining single payer systems, and that they are roughly the size of larger US states; remember these are people half a globe away with their own needs and tax/infrastructure setups.
