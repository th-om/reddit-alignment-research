cvjf1zo,1,t3_3mzcsc,lollersauce914,"> If the Russians help Assad regain control over Syria, it would help end the civil war and push out ISIS, and probably end the refugee crisis.

Just like how the troop surge in Iraq led to everlasting peace and stability in Iraq and quelled the threat of sectarian violence forever more...

The only real solution is a peace agreement that gives Sunni's a stake in Syria's government, which pretty much necessitates Assad stepping down.",8,0,1443629973,1444721465
cvjgvge,0,t1_cvjf1zo,pleasure2kill,Do you think that's possible while still maintaining a strong central government though? Iraq seems to be having a hard time getting the Shia and Sunnis to actually work together as a strong and unified government and military.

cvjnygv,0,t1_cvjgvge,lollersauce914,"I mean, I think it would be crazy hubris to say I know what to do. 

I don't think there can really be a centralized state of Syria at this point. A federal solution might work. We also might have to look at the splitting of Syria into different countries.

The best solution has to take into account all sorts of things on the ground, like access to arable land and water, ethnic identity, and, you know, who people are willing to live with and who they're not. I don't have anywhere close to the information necessary to say what that would really look like.",2,0,1443642505,1444721472
cvjoruo,0,t1_cvjnygv,pleasure2kill,"I'm in the same boat. I thought those ideas would work in Iraq too, but in the end it seems ridiculous to think that an outside power can just come in and redraw borders and install governments.

cvjpmit,1,t3_3mzcsc,thatnameagain,"Assad most certainly did not prevent the spread of terrorism, but it's unquestionable that he's not quite as bad as ISIS would be. 

The problem is that the Russian's move seems designed solely to protect Assad and not to roll back ISIS, hence the fact that they didn't target ISIS at all in the first round of attack but hit the FSA instead. 

I'm not sure if Putin cares if ISIS maintains a large foothold in Syria, he just doesn't want any U.S. supported groups there. ",2,0,1443644845,1444721472
cvjqv6p,0,t1_cvjpmit,pleasure2kill,"I guess my point is more along the lines that the FSA shouldn't be supported by the U.S. at all, and having a strong central dictatorship in Syria, even if propped up by the Russian military, is preferable to having some ragtag freedom fighters overthrow that government and replace it with total chaos. I think the U.S. should do whatever they have to do to seem ""outraged,"" but back away from Syria and their civil war. Either the Russians will help Assad get power back and defeat ISIS and the FSA, or they'll just be bogged down in an unwinnable quagmire which will drain their military strength - both of which seem like the closest thing to a ""win"" the U.S. could hope for in that conflict. If we back the FSA and fund/arm/train them and they win, we'll eventually see the country fall to utter chaos, and some random terrorist group will gain power and use our equipment against us.

Yes, overall I think diplomacy with Iran is preferable to any other alternative.

cvkfgsj,0,t1_cvjzw89,m0ddem,"Interesting, and not a common viewpoint to hold (as I'm sure you're aware).

My main issue is that Syria is an open wound at this point, generating millions of refugees and displaced persons internally; to crib from your views on murder and life imprisonment, leaving Assad in power just isn't an acceptable answer at this point.  It would be different if the country was relatively stable (as Iraq was), but even still this isn't merely a position of altruism; ceding the Syrian situation to Russia without any American interests being satisfied, much less an internationally palatable solution reached, allows the Russian sphere of influence to grow at our expense.

Sure, they're also Shia, but because they're so very secular I don't think the regime survives without an Assad at the helm; you'd get too much infighting if the cult of personality isn't there.

Thus, replacing him means an erosion of Russian influence, which is why I think Putin is fighting so hard in the court of international opinion to prevent his ouster as part of a diplomatic solution.",1,0,1443737624,1444721477

So, as you observed, not Assad. Because there is no freaking way that Assad will ever be able to dream of controlling the entire population like he once did. 

You know that famous Machiavelli line of ""It is better to be feared than loved""? What people don't remember is that Machiavelli observed that being HATED was much worse than being feared or loved and was when a prince was fucked.
