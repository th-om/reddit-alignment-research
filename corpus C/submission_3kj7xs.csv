3kj7xs,How would you handle Donald Trump?,28,jmj1970,"I have been thinking about how I would handle Trump. I would like to think I could have realized that Trump is simply a highly skilled heckler and who knows how to handle a heckler better then a highly skilled standup comedian? Which is why I enjoyed this commentary which covers Seinfelds idea for how he has handled hecklers - pity and helpful counseling.
