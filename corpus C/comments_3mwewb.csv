I'm doing a masters program of which algorithms I actually help design are being used, while I'm sitting around with people that have no business being in the programs, while I begged and pleaded to the school to get into the program for almost 2 years, because I obviously had the qualifications that were being taught, but didn't have an undergrad to get into the program.

One of the classes I am taking now is preparation for a business license that I got in 2001, and here I am 14 years later, pretty much calling BS on everything the professor says, when they have never even taken the exam to get the license.

While I've had a very fruitful career, there has always been this need for me to actually get a degree that lesser peers than I had, but now I'm in school learning things I learned the first month on the job, and have more of an understanding of the actual work than the person teaching the class does. And in one case, an entire chapter of text was dedicated to a report I managed the group who wrote it 6 years ago. And the worst part was, we took a test on that chapter, and I apparently didn't pass, even though my name was literally the second name on the assessment we studied, but apparently I knew absolute shit about something that I helped write, and actually lead the project that created the assessment used by a few schools now as an example of how to actually do something.
