1. He ripped Jeb Bush apart for considering sending troops back to Iraq but also said he is going to destroy ISIS. Unless he plans on leveling the country with bombs this is a hypocritical viewpoint.

2. He says Mexico is going to pay for a border wall. The only way we could force them to do that would be placing absurd sanctions on their country that would sink the global economy.

3. Birthright citizenship isn't going anywhere.

4. He knows absolutely nothing about foreign affairs. I think asking about Suleimani was a gotcha question (even though he did come up in the debate) but he should know the [difference between Hamas and Hezbollah](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/04/donald-trump-difference-between-hamas-hezbollah-quds-kurds).

cusmoww,1,t3_3jvhiq,hdaviirus,"I am pretty sure there has never been a president, in the over 250 years the United States existed, that had 0 political or military experience. Donald Trump is a famous business man, and arguably not even a good one at that.

The only reason that he is doing well right now is because the field is so split, and the American people like the bluntness of his rhetoric. But as soon as candidates start to drop out, the support of the failed candidates will shift to the more establishment candidates in the field like Jeb or Rubio.",9,0,1441561278,1444732150

cusn41c,1,t3_3jvhiq,shzadh,"Trump cannot be taken seriously as a candidate for the presidency. He's not knowledgeable on basic foreign policy, economics, or diplomacy. He can't get the minority vote. IMO, he won't make it like Michelle Bachmann and Hermain Cain who were both leading the polls during this time as well in the last elections.

> It’s no longer “politically correct” to call African Americans “coloreds.” Or to pat a woman on the butt at work and say, “Nice job, honey.” Or to ask people their religion during a job interview. Or to deny a woman a job because she’s not attractive enough to you. Or to assume a person’s opinion is worth less because she is elderly. Or that physically challenged individuals shouldn’t have easy access to buildings. If you don’t have time for political correctness, you don’t have time to be the caretaker of our rights under the Constitution. It’s easy to buy into the Trump mirage because his rising poll numbers indicate he’s actually doing well. But polls are historically misleading, and his supporters will eventually desert him. Many, such as Tom McCarthy in the Guardian, have laid out the statistical reasons Trump can’t win, complete with graphs that show polls from past presidential candidates who were doing even better than Trump at this stage of an election, only to fade into political irrelevance, like Rudy Giuliani, Howard Dean and Ross Perot. In 2008, Hillary Clinton was also a front-runner who unexpectedly got beat for the nomination by Obama.
