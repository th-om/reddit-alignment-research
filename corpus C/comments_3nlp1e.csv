I promise, I only link him because he has a legitimate chance to win a senate seat in Florida. Invictus is likely to slaughter another animal on youTube during the course of his campaign, as he appears to court the favor of the gods by animal sacrifice. Think about the prospect of running against someone who slaughters a goat in the parking lot and then comes to debate you.

I'm not sure any but the staunchest of real socialists could even run against a candidate like that, and it would be a weird campaign.
