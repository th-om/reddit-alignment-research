I see a universal pattern to the most common anti-gun control arguments: It infringes upon the 2nd amendment and it's a step on the slippery slope to an Australian style takeaway

One of the biggest arguments against universal background checks in 2013/2014 was that it would create a registry of gun-owners that could/would be used in an eventual takeaway of guns
