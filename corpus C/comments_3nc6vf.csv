I don't think most liberals would care so much about a stricter abortion timeline if the alternative wasn't monetary ruination.  Europe's centralized healthcare systems and safety nets are the primary difference here, and it's politically more effective (surprisingly) to push for abortion access than it is to advocate single-payer healthcare and expanded welfare.",14,0,1443910042,1444719711

Are you going to put them all into either foster care or adoption services? I think it's silly and morally inconsistent to be pro-life with respect to the baby in the womb and not be conscious of the horrific realities that will plague all the unwanted children who would be born without adequate abortion rights/access. I also think it's inconsistent to use economic/fiscal arguments to propose cuts to welfare spending, but refuse to bring economics onto the discussion with respect to abortion.

Where I disagree is that this is essential to, or actually relevant at all, for the discussion on abortion. If I understand you correctly: You look at it from the perspective of consequences, if this baby would be born he would probably have a horrible life so it would be better that he wasn't.  

I look at it in a perspective about fundamental human rights. At what point does a fetus (biologically a human being (!) without human rights) become a baby (a person with human rights). Where are you aborting something from a mother's body and where are you murdering a baby. I feel that the point at which a human being gets human rights should absolutely not be tied to the economic prospects that that human being might face in life. It is and should be a separate issue. 
",0,0,1444043751,1444719715
cvpm270,0,t1_cvosnu7,PerfectSociety,"Well my perspective on the issue is based on the intentional separation between my own personal moral views on abortion and what I think government policy regarding abortion should be. While I may view certain abortions done at certain time periods during the pregnancy to be uncomfortable from a moral standpoint, I think it's important to realize that it is impossible to ever define where the rights of the baby start and where the rights of the mother to control her own body end. You could argue the morality either way, which is why I don't think that is the right angle with which to propose government policy regarding abortion. I think people should just make those choices on their own because everyone has a different sense of the morality. The issue is complex enough for it to be impossible for people to ever reach a real consensus based solely on morality. That is why my view on what government policy with regard to abortion should be is the following - Abortion at any stage of pregnancy for any reason should be allowed by law. Why? Because from a socioeconomic standpoint, abortion reduces crime. (http://freakonomics.com/2005/05/15/abortion-and-crime-who-should-you-believe/). My view is that government policies should be largely based on utilitarianism. From this perspective, being pro-choice makes sense because reducing access/legality of abortion creates more harm to society overall than good, and the children that aren't aborted in the womb by and large will not have very good lives.

I agree with this on many issues, but not abortion. Why is it ok to abort a pregnancy 1 day before the mother is due to give birth, but is euthanizing the same baby 1 day after birth wrong? That baby wasn't relevantly different.

The problem I have with allowing the mother to choose what happens to the unborn baby in 100% of the time that it is in her body is that it doesn't protect the baby. At some point the fetus progresses biologically and it becomes a person just like you or I. I feel that it deserves the same protections as you and I and that means that the mother cannot decide whether it lives or dies. 

In my mind the point where this line has to be drawn only needs a basis in biology, what characteristics do persons have and at what developmental stage do fetusses develop them. 

If you open up socio economic reasons for deciding who deserves to live. Which you are doing if you allow abortions at any time after which you can biologically call an unborn baby a person. You could actually apply the same reasoning to situations with live humans, which we don't because humans have human rights. ",1,0,1444253859,1444719715

I don't really buy into slippery slope arguments much, because we already have such contradictions in many aspects of our laws and in society. Even if we allow late term abortions, how would that lead to adult citizen's lives being taken for socioeconomic reasons? Who would make that decision? In the case of the aborted fetus, the mother made that decision. Who is there to make a decision like that for an adult citizen? But I generally just don't put much weight onto slippery slope arguments. When FDR became President, people thought that his policies would lead to socialism in the U.S. That didn't actually happen.

Long story short, water is a commodity that is hugely under-priced -- pretty much all over the United States, because voters select for politicians who say inane shit like ""Water is a human right!"" even though it is, quite actually, a scarce resource.

The artificially low price encourages consumers to use more than they otherwise would.  If the price reflected it's scarcity, farmers would be incentivized to use more efficient irrigation methods -- but since the price is so low, it's much cheaper to simply throw water at your crops at high noon instead of watering your crops at dusk with an efficient drip-irrigation system (which would be a capital investment).  If the price reflected its scarcity, consumers would be MUCH more strongly incentivized to purchase and use more efficient water-using appliances, and would probably use less water themselves.  It also doesn't help that there are all kinds of agricultural subsidies at the Federal level for water-hungry crops.

But, powerful political lobbies and voters that can be bought by the appeal of ""[artificially] free/cheap stuff"" (not an insult, they're just chasing economic incentives) result in water that is subsidized and priced in a way that does not reflect its cost.

Flying is cheaper for any train trip over a few hours. There's no competition for trains whereas there's lots of competition for airlines. Americans today don't really need a passenger rail network since almost everyone has a car and the national highway system is excellent.

The high speed trains are competitive for trips up to ~500 miles, which is 3 or 4 hours. There are some cases where as a tourist you'll find high speed train fares are higher than flying, but that's usually the symptom of the high speed train option being so overwhelmingly preferable to travellers, especially business travellers, that there is huge demand.

Of course there are things that America does better, and of course some of the phenomenon is Americans thinking that ""the grass is greener"" over in europe, and visiting europe and talking to europeans there are definitely many who believe that the grass is greener over in the US.

However there are many things that Europe does better. To /u/Foxtrot56's comment I would add that:

* They spend 20% to 40% less per person per year on healthcare and have healthier people with longer life expectancies.
* They build towns and cities where walking, biking and using public transportation is a pleasurable and efficient experience.
* Forget specifically talking about right-wing political violence, just in general they have much less violence in their societies and exponentially less gun violence or other fatal violence.

So controlling for ethnicity, how much longer do people in America allegedly live, and where is your source, and then after that, is it really worth spending 30% to 70% more per capita per year compared to similarly wealthy european countries?

> No, they're poorer, and are forced to rely on those things rather than buy cars.

Some are richer than America, most are slightly poorer, but your argument still doesn't hold because europe's wealthy are more likely to prefer living in city centers than their counterparts in America. Rich people in europe are more likely to prefer a townhouse or apartment compared to a suburban house. Many of europe's more suburban-type areas are more middle and working class than wealthy. Depending on the country, in some the suburbs are overwhelmingly impoverished. And in any case ""suburbs"" in europe are different than in america and more densely developed than most of them are here. Which supports my argument that Europe builds compelling cities that are so nice that they are the preferred choice of wealthy people, whereas only in a few regions of America do substantial numbers of wealthy people choose to live in city centers (although it is a steadily increasing trend since the 1990's).

It would be much more accurate to say that europe's greater population density and much lower amount of farmland per capita contributes to their denser development, rather than europe being poorer. Otherwise you would expect at least the wealthy europeans to live in US-style houses. European leaders have been concerned about urban development encroaching on their productive farmland and scarce forests for hundreds of years, so they have a hundreds-of-years legacy of urban planning and restricting development.

But I don't really car *why* they have awesome cities and what external factors may have lead them there, I just care that they have them and I wish that America had more of them.",1,0,1443966492,1444719771

When I was in High School it was great to be able to get a job and make some money.  You couldn't really do that in Europe.  In College it was better in Europe because the education was free (I did half my education in the US and half in Europe) and my job paid about 30% more than I could make in the US since I made $7 an hour in the US but $10 an hour in Europe.  Plus in Europe they gave me back a ton of my salary and literally forced me to go on vacation in the middle of a big project.  So I jumped on a train for a month and explored the continent as a 19 year old.  Was epic.  After college is was awesome in the US since I immediately could make $100,000 a year.  However within a year of graduation I immediately started to see the problems.  For me at least. In college I always had the summers free to go travel and enjoy my life.  I had weekends free.  Working with 2 week vacations in the US was a nightmare.  Plus I didn't get any vacation that first year, just vacation pay and I had to work weekends.  After another year I got another 1 week off and stopped working weekends and then it never changed.  I got exactly 3 weeks off and it would never go up because I ""made so much money and should be happy with that"".  Later that punch line turned into ""I should be happy I have a job"".  Then came the bills.  My work paid for my health insurance and covered my expenses so that was good but the hassle was insane.  Almost every single claim was denied and I had to fight for them to pay my medical bills.  I had an HSA that covered bills that my insurance wouldn't cover but it just sucked overall.  Then there was all the insurance needed on top of that and I seemed to always get rear ended and need to deal with car insurance problems.  That actually was pretty awesome while in college since I made money on settlements but was a major burden while working.  Plus 1 week after graduating from college I bought a new car and within 2 days someone did a hit and run on it and tore up the whole drivers side.  This drove up my insurance a lot.  While my junker in college cost me about $28 a month for insurance suddenly I was having to pay about $160 a month.  Gas prices then spiked to ridiculous levels, rent rose, housing prices sky rocketed, and the next thing you know it's all heading in the other direction with housing prices dropping 20% and everything just going to shit.  So basically I had no time off, constant hassles with my car and health insurance, housing prices dropping, everyone miserable, half the people at work losing their jobs, and on top of that spending way too much time in my car commuting.  Never in my life had I had such a low quality of life.  I had money in the bank but everything else sucked ass.  I wanted to start a family and dreaded the idea based on what my friends were going through.  Daycare cost most of them $1200 a month and those with older kids wouldn't even let them ride their bikes on the street because they were scared of kidnappings and child molestation.  Fears that I think are completely blown out of proportion but something that everyone seemed to have.  My cousins were going to college 10 to 20 years after me and while I got grants, scholarships, and had to borrow some money it wasn't that big of a deal.  They were all borrowing between $60,000 and $100,000 to get their bachelor degrees and then after that needed to get a masters degree and borrow more money  I honestly couldn't imagine much worse for my children.  At least not in the developed world.

Today I can't imagine living in the US again.  Not until things change.  I go back regularly and my impression is always one of disappointment.  There is very little stability in the US for everyone I know and life is pretty unhealthy.  Some examples from just the last few months:  My cousin lost his job right after buying a house, one of my friends and his wife worked at Whole Foods and got let go at the same time, and my aunt lost her job as a doctor right before she was going to retire.  At will states just fuck you. The only ones who got any benefits were those working for whole foods who got a small severance package.  On top of that a friend took a second mortgage on his house to pay for medical bills.  Everyone, my family included, is overweight and most are obese.  It's just depressing to see.

A life in Europe is very different.  You generally wouldn't make as much money (but still have a good amount of disposable income), you live in way smaller homes, and at least 25 years ago I really felt that Europeans were much less tolerant than Americans were.  I lived in Sweden for example in the mid 1990's when they had skinheads on the streets.  That was some fucked up shit.  On the other hand though the most racist place I've ever been is in the US.  I was in New Orleans before and after Hurricane Katrina and that is definitely the most fucked up, dehumanizing, racist shit I have ever seen in my life.

Today however everyone I know in Europe does well there.  Even with the economies not doing as well as they used to.  Nobody is that rich.  I have a family friend in Manhattan worth just shy of $500 million but in Europe I think the richest people I know are barely above a millionaire and only due to expensive real estate in some of the capital cities.  Mostly they own their homes or in some cases rent nice apts in city centers, they take 2 vacations a year - one for a couple weeks during the winter and one for a month or more during the summer depending on how long they've been working, their kids go to great daycare centers for a couple dollars a day that teach them multiple languages, none have student loans but still have Masters or PhDs that they got for free or near free, they don't need cars but a few have them if they live outside of a city, commutes are less than 30 minutes for most people and some of my friends walk or ride their bike to work, they exercise a lot and with the exception of a couple people they're all fit or at least not overweight, they eat better and in the case of my Italian friends they spend hours a day eating and multiple generations will leave work to all have lunch together before going back to work, when their parents retire they do so in dignity with the exception of Greece where it's pretty awful right now.  They might sell their flat or house in the city and go live out in the country travelling for a few months a year or if they're doing well they already have a country place and just keep both.  It was also not that uncommon for people to retire at 60 with full benefits but that has definitely changed. Speaking of retirement I maxed out my social security benefits in the US but will get more from working in Europe.  I apparently have to notify the embassy so that I don't get both benefits but basically as I understand it I will collect zero social security since my retirement benefits from working in Europe are higher.

Then there's also the discourse.  In the US I can't talk about politics or religion since they're such polarizing topics.  Nobody changes their mind and our culture has turned into a dichotomy.  You're either R or D, with us or against us, lazy or work like a dog, etc.  This makes it difficult for me to adjust when I come home and makes it really hard for me to want to move home.  Don't get me wrong I would LOVE to go home to the US to be closer to my family and friends.  I regularly cover my bases by applying to jobs with my SO, but the lack of benefits just kills it and the thought of going back to ""Yeah I went to home depot and mowed the lawn how was your weekend?"" type conversations over and over again makes me cringe.  I've noticed that salaries have evened out so that I make the same in Europe but after taxes, expenses, and plus benefits I come out ahead in Europe since I value the family time, vacation, and hassle free life.",4,0,1443901906,1444719783
cvn1j3i,0,t1_cvn1ixt,Jenocular,"That's me though.  I like going to cafes and hanging out with my friends a couple times a week, I like the free time, I like job stability and unions protecting my rights, I like the office environment not having lots of penny pinchers and people screaming and stressed out half the time, I love being able to leave work if I need to and people being understanding, I like living in a place that doesn't have lots of homeless people and despair, I like being able to explore new cities and towns on a regular basis and not having to worry about crime, I'm really into photography and it's much easier in Europe since they don't put fences up everywhere, I love the cheap airfare around the continent, mass transit is amazing, etc.  What I still don't like though and I must warn anyone about before even considering living in Europe is the way you get a job.  One great thing about the US is that you can walk into pretty much any business (at least you could) and tell them you will work hard, have this skill set, are a fast learner, and want a chance to work with them.  I got hired on the spot every time.  After all they would just fire you if you sucked.  The point is though that you could do it.  I could walk into an Engineering firm and get a job despite not having the exact engineering degree they were looking for.  They knew I had the science background and could learn and that was good enough for them. In Europe that's not the case.  If you want a job as a garbage man you probably need a garbage man degree.  It's super annoying.  It's incredibly inflexible and one thing I hope changes in Europe soon.

To answer your question though in not so many words there are a few catch phrases that really sum up how I feel.  In the US you live to work.  In Europe you work to live.  In the US we talk about our standard of living.  In Europe they talk about their quality of life.  At the end of the day money is not everything.  The quality of life in Europe is, in my opinion, leagues ahead of the United States.  It's not perfect but holy crap if you get into the system in Europe it's amazing!",2,0,1443901914,1444719787

I'm not proposing any solution, I'm describing the current state of American culture, which is a reflection of the collective thoughts and feelings of the individuals within it. To elaborate:

1. We can blame guns or mental illness all we want, but the simple fact is that these young, white men do not feel like there is a place for them in today's society, and they are reacting violently as a result.  I'm not saying *anything* about whether these feelings are legitimate or justified, but the fact that so many feel that way has to say *something* about why these kids feel like they have nothing to lose. (Gang related violence is different - more of a function of illegality of their commercial enterprises, if you can't enforce your agreements with contracts, you have to do so with guns)

2. Some religious groups in the US *do* want to bring about the end of the world.  That's why many give so much money to Israel - because Jesus won't come back until the Jews reoccupy Judea.  It's an ongoing apocalypse fantasy.  These beliefs seep into and become a part of the culture at large.

3. ""The happening"" and other doomsday/collapse ideations are real and likely played some part in fueling both the Charleston and Oregon shooters.  It's related to the preparatory actions of some militias, like the Oath Keepers, who have recently said [they're ready for war with the federal gov't](http://www.vice.com/read/miner-threat-0000747-v22n9).  

4.  Prepper culture is just people trying to hedge against ""something"" going very wrong.  While some is focused on environmental disasters, that's certainly not all people prep for.

5. Media and art reflect reality.  Why do people tune in to watch movies and tv about the end of society?  For the same reason that people in the 20th century couldn't get enough of doomsday nuclear movies involving the Soviets - it's a way of safely playing out our fears.  Currently, our culture does fear ""the end"" of something.

This is not a political issue so much as a cultural one.  People feel like we are headed in the wrong direction and the more that idea gains momentum, the more likely it is to take on a life of its own and, at that point, it'll become impossible to predict where and how the chips may fall.",5,0,1443891073,1444719819

cvmuwdg,1,t3_3nc6vf,TheNaBr,"You nailed the reason, imo.  Its because redditors tend to hold liberal beliefs.  American liberal beliefs tend to revere centralized government, large social assistance states,  and pacifism.  Europe is an example of all three.  

All the European countries are examples of central control from a national government, the American idea of majority control falling to the states despite being of similar size to European nations, for some reason is disliked by a lot of American liberals because they don't like variance in rules.  This is why things like a constant push for national gun rights or national healthcare and so on has occurred in America.  This one is a little misguided in my opinion because there is similar variance in the European model.  It's just something about the idea of *total central control* that is alluring to american liberals.  Many want a world government that would also embody this idea.  

Large social assistance states are desired by American liberals because it shows people that you care without having to do anything yourself.  It also provides people with services that they don't have to earn themselves.  It guarantees that if you fall on hard times, or lose all motivation, you'll still be okay.  Things like public transportation also fall into this category as well as Union control.  In Europe, because all the states evolved from monarchies, there is a strong sense of class warfare and Marxism that is alive and well.  There is also a desire to believe in class warfare from the American liberal.  

Pacifism has been a strong vein for American liberals as well.  Europe has been largely peaceful since WW2 as long as you ignore the Cold War tension and all that.  The European militaries have been downgraded and have become very small.

Now, both the large social states and the downgraded militaries go hand in hand because they both relate to government spending,  which is astronomical in Europe and doesn't both American liberals.
