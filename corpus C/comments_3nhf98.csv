Members of households are also not immortal. If they die before they pay back their debt then, in many cases with some exceptions, those debts are not going to be paid back. Households also have a difficult time changing their income to repay their debts. They can ask for a raise or look for a new job, but these things take time and don't always work. Governments can modify their tax rates. 

A lot of government debt is also different government agencies borrowing from another agency, or the government borrowing from its own citizens. Households only occasionally borrow significant amounts of money from members of the household. ",11,0,1443987313,1444718896

Because of both of those realities debt is a much more pressing matter. You have truly time limited resources. The government, barring revolution, is forever. It also generally has a much better control over its revenue given the fact it can raise taxes. Also, debt markets  view stable government debt as a safe place to park money for a relatively good return on investment given the negligible risk. In short there is actual market demand for US debt.

On top of that because the government is forever, it will never lose the ability to pay the interest on debt, so it never really needs to pay it down to function.",8,0,1443987340,1444718896

Private debt must be paid off under threat of force, which is issued solely by the government. Since the government has a monopoly of force, it has no obligation to pay off its debt since by definition it has the final say on everything within its region.

That is not to say that governments can take out debt with no consequences, or that they can take out infinite debt, or that governments can't get invaded and be forced to pay off their debt.

cvo4tsi,1,t3_3nhf98,linkns86,"I'm going to focus on similarities, since a lot of others are focusing on differences.  

The first difference that might seem apparent is that governments can just print their own money.  However, money is only a *representation* of value.  Printing more money doesn't actually create or add value to the economy.  Instead, printing more money means that each individual dollar is actually worth *less*.  This is called inflation and it is why we can't simply print away our debts.  

The second difference is longevity.  Nationally are usually around longer than individuals and can therefore borrow more.  However, sooner or later debts have to be repaid in order for the creditor to benefit.  If this fails to happen, people will be less willing to lend to that nation.  

The third is taxes.  A nation raising taxes is one way to pay off debt, it is akin to someone getting a raise.  An important difference is that people can move from the country if the taxes become too high- meaning that raising taxes doesn't always mean more tax revenue. ",-2,0,1443989530,1444718900
cvo783s,0,t1_cvo4tsi,CompactedConscience,"tl;dr: The things you mention are mostly true, but they wouldn't actually impair the ability of a government to pay back their debts. 

>representation of value

I'm not sure what real world argument this is trying to make. It is factually easier for governments to pay back their debt if they have borrowed in their own currency and can print money to pay it off. This has side effects that are not always ideal, but it is still mechanically true. Inflation has distributional consequences, but it is unclear what they are. I don't think many people think inflation has consequences with respect to the ""real"" economy unless it gets very high. 

>longevity

There is no evidence of any of the claims you make here. Countries have had access to credit markets reduced after a default, but not ever because they have borrowed for too long. Individual creditors can choose how long the government has before it gets paid back. Bonds of many governments can be for 1, 10, or 30 years. The money you get paid back might have been borrowed from someone else, but you as an individual credit don't care about that and it doesn't impact your decision to borrow money in the future. If debts get excessively high you might think there is a risk of default and demand a higher interest rate to compensate you for that risk, but that is a separate issue. 

>taxes

This is 100% true in theory. There is some level you can raise tax rates to that will depress tax collection revenue. It could happen for the reason you mentioned or because the taxes make people so poor that general economic activity is depressed. However, there is absolutely no evidence that we are anywhere near that rate of taxes. We could significantly increase revenues by raising taxes from current rates. Again, it wouldn't be ideal. It would hurt economic growth. However, it wouldn't hurt economic growth enough to where revenue would actually fall.

Printing off money for our debts would radically devalue our currency and essentially acts as a hidden tax on all our earnings and savings.

I am discussing defaulting- which should be clear,

>However, sooner or later debts have to be repaid in order for the creditor to benefit. If this fails to happen, people will be less willing to lend to that nation.

My point is that longevity doesn't mean that we can't or won't default if we borrow too much.

You're right, we could do this and increase revenue.  It would also adversely effect economic growth.  ",-2,0,1443993968,1444718900

Inflation isn't that simple and it depends on a lot of other factors, especially money velocity. Furthermore, inflation does absolutely nothing to erode earnings. If money is worth less then you also have to pay more for an hour of labor. There is no good empirical support for the idea that inflation erodes wages. Finally, inflation would only erode cash savings. All other kinds of savings would be unaffected. Unexpected inflation actually helps the average consumer save, as it reduces the burdens of their debts. 

>defaulting

So then you haven't addressed the longevity point at all? Because the longevity point isn't meant to establish that the US won't default. 

>growth

Yeah, and I want to clarify. I am not advocating unlimited borrowing. There are very real consequences of too much borrowing. However, it is also easy to go too far the other direction and start fear-mongering about the current levels of debt.",6,0,1443994730,1444718900
cvo8oum,0,t1_cvo8c4b,linkns86,"> Inflation isn't that simple and it depends on a lot of other factors, especially money velocity. 

It's safe to say that if we are printing to pay off debts its not going to keep up with growth in our productive capacity- which is textbook inflation.  Moreover, I'm just stating the simple fact that anytime more money is printed it will devalue the currency.

> Furthermore, inflation does absolutely nothing to erode earnings. If money is worth less then you also have to pay more for an hour of labor.

Technically true, but there are a thousand negative effects associated with increased inflation that would probably reduce wages (it would have to be a lot of inflation to be apparent, however). 

>So then you haven't addressed the longevity point at all? Because the longevity point isn't meant to establish that the US won't default.

I'm clearing up the misconception that longevity mean debts can be owed indefinitely without consequence.  Once again, this should have been apparent.

I am not trying to say this in a rude way, but it doesn't sound like you understand inflation very well. Money creation does not have a one to one relationship with inflation. The strength of the relationship depends on a lot of factors. Most of those factors are pointing in the direction of money creation not being very inflationary in the current environment. Productive capacity is only tangentially related to any of the factors. 

>inflation effects on wages

What I said isn't just technically true, it is true in substance. The vast weight of the evidence points to inflation not having the effect you described on wages. And I can't think of a realistic channel inflation could operate through where it would have that effect. Wages would have to be sticky upwards, which they certainly aren't to the extent that they stricky downwards. 

>longevity again

No, but it does mean that they can be borrowed for much longer than a typical househould would borrow them. That is the important issue here. There is no *inevitable* closing of the ledger. Defaults can happen but that is completely orthogonal to the issue of longevity. 

>amount we borrow yearly

In gross amounts, the amount we borrow looks very high. But if you do apples to apples comparisons of deficit to GDP ratios (400 billion/17 trillion) or debt to asset ratios (17 trillion/ hundreds of trillions) the US government would look healthier than almost any business. The liabilities are not unfunded, they just aren't prefunded. You can tell people have an agenda when they start to pretend like we should account for our debt as if we already owed everything we will spend on government pensions for the next 200 years. 

The ultimate arbiter of creditworthiness is the bond market. If there was a real fear of default, people would not be buying bonds with the risk compensation they currently accept. ",4,0,1443995852,1444718900

 The problem is that our debt has a cumulative effect.  The longer we project outward, the higher our debt becomes in relation to our GDP, assets and tax revue.  That is the definition of an unsustainable business model.      ",-1,0,1443996713,1444718900
cvo9yxu,0,t1_cvo9l4x,CompactedConscience,">other factors? 

Money velocity springs immediately to mind. We have created a lot of money over the past 7 or 8 years. Inflation has been very subdued over that period. The money isn't going anywhere. This is still an oversimplification, but no one predicting excessive inflation from money creation is being taken very seriously anymore by people who understand the models that aren't oversimplifications. 

>people losing a significant portion of their savings.

Again, I there is no evidence that inflation is a net harm to the savings of a median saver. Unexpected inflation is beneficial to the savings position of anyone with lots of debt. Neither expected nor unexpected inflation would have any kind of effect on non cash savings. Very few people are debt free and have a significant amount of their savings in cash, and that is the only kind of saver that would really be hurt by inflation. 

>cumulative effect? 

That isn't necessarily true. And projections typically become less and less certain about anything the further you project out. Over time frames we can reasonably be certain about anything, US sovereign debt doesn't look very bad. At time frames where **some** projections make US sovereign debt look bad, a million and one things could change. ",4,0,1443997324,1444718900
cvoul8n,1,t3_3nhf98,RedOctober15,"Govt debt can be [almost] indefinitely passed on because they collude with or control the central banks. In other words, it's a corrupt monopoly on our money.

You are their golden egg layer. A slave to pay for what they spend on. You are the a cog in their machine that keeps them going.
