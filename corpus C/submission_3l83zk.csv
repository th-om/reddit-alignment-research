3l83zk,Should Bernie Sander's support for Jeremy Corbyn be considered a negative given Corbyn's foreign policy views?,12,UKIPcampaignteam,"So Sanders has congratulated Corbyn for his landslide victory and Corbyn has said that he has followed Sander's campaign closely. Should this be considered a negative given Corbyn's views on foreign policy?

He thinks that Israel is an apartheid like regime and supports recognizing Palestine, boycotting goods from Israeli, Israel withdrawing from those occupied territory, Israel decommissioning its nuclear weapons, as well as condemning Israel bombing Gaza and Israeli settlements on the West bank. 

He thinks that expansion of American influence in Eastern Europe is what has caused the reaction of Russian expansion into Ukraine.

He is against all wars. There has literally never been a war hes been in favour of.

Hhe thinks the UK should have openly been against US involvement in Vietnam and backed the Norht despite the Labour government never sending any British troops to Nam.

Wants Britain to exit NATO and abolish its nuclear weapons making the country less safe.

Wants the West to stop backing dictatorships like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.

All of these views are deeply anti-American so should Bernie's support for Corbyn be considered a negative? Should we question his dedication to American exceptionalism and Zionism? I think its a deeply shocking development.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l83zk/should_bernie_sanders_support_for_jeremy_corbyn/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442439899,1444727795
