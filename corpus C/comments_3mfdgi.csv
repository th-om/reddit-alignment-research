cvejdjc,1,t3_3mfdgi,Cassus_Caritas,"""To do some good""

In the mind of people that agree with his political opinions, what he is doing is good. 

Good is subjective. 

It seems that Boehner just seems tired of the job, and tired of constantly being in the war-zone (based on what little I have read). 

Anyway: the chances of appointing a Democrat are close to zero. 

The chances of appointing a moderate Republican are higher than appointing an extreme Republican because usually extreme Republicans are also a bit ostracized within their own party. 

Reminder that the word ""moderate"" is a finicky term that can be applied in many different ways.
