3krdzd,I've been hearing lots of people decry Trump's stance on illegal immigration. But what exactly is he wrong about? What's the better alternative?,104,ballandabiscuit,"I don't know much about illegal immigration policies and law.  

From what I understand Trump is very strong against illegal immigration. Other than building a wall on our Mexican border (which is obviously a crazy idea and never going to happen), it sounds like he thinks that illegals should not belong here and we need to get them out.  

What exactly is wrong with this? What's the point of having laws against immigration if we're going to just allow people to immigrate here illegally, stay here and work here?  

Please note that I'm not saying I agree wholeheartedy with Trump. I'm saying I don't know much about this and I'd like to learn more.  

Thanks!",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3krdzd/ive_been_hearing_lots_of_people_decry_trumps/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442130409,1444729669
