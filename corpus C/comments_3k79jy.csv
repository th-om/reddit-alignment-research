Knowing quite a few academics as my wife has been a professor 20+ at a leading private university in the RTP area (would not be hard to guess).  They are all out of touch with how people live outside of their own circle, every single one of them.

Also, academics look at evidence to draw conclusions. Because of this, their opinion is more valuable than the opinion of non academics when we are asking questions that require evidence to answer. This is one of those questions. ",2,0,1441811903,1444731354

>NAFTA and like are good at the macro but no good for the micro, and that is where people live.

Analysis has shown that in the long term, there is zero effect on unemployment, lower prices, and a raise in income. Any job that is lost on the low end is created on the high end due to economic restructuring. I shouldn't care that a factory of steelworkers lose their jobs when it creates just as many jobs for software engineers and lowers price of steel. This is how we raise standard of living and achieve long-term economic growth.
