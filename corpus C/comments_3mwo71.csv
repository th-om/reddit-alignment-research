cvisy5r,0,t1_cvisplq,down42roads,">On December 24, 1952, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (the ""1952 Statute"") became effective. As under the previous statute, where both parents were U.S. citizens, one parent would have to have resided in the United States prior to the child's birth in order to transmit U.S. citizenship. The meaning of residence previously applied under the 1940 Statute was essentially the same as under the 1952 Statute.

>In the case of a child born to one U.S. citizen parent and one alien parent, the U.S. citizen parent now had only to be physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions prior to the child's birth for 10 years, at least 5 of which were after the age of 14. ""Physical presence"" was different from the concept of ""residence"" which had applied under the previous statute. The physical presence requirement could be satisfied by mere presence in the United States even if the person had not established a legal residence there.

http://www.americanlaw.com/citabrd.html

That law was in effect when President Obama was born in 1961. Because his mother (the parent with US citizenship) was only 18 when he was born, she could not have met the 5 year requirement. As such, had the President been born in Kenya, he would not have been a citizen by birth.

I think since it was a big issue for Obama during his campaign but nobody cares whatsoever about Cruz even though their situations are identical it shows that the movement was always either purely political or racial or both and never had to do with objective qualifications to be president.

cviss76,1,t3_3mwo71,AMatterofTrust,"Was he one of those people? ""Because there were questions"" in Ted Cuz's ideological group does not mean he made such comments, or that laws somehow change. Technically he does fit the criteria for running for president. There have been numerous Supreme Court cases on this subject. 

Because CONSTITUTIONALLY, he is a ""natural-born citizen, as per the definition of natural-born citizen. A natural born citizen the courts, all sources for the US constitution, the founders, the naturalization act of 1790 which provides clarification, show that the phrase ""natural born citizen"" means that a person who does not have to go through the naturalization process at a later date. The committee that created the phrase has even agreed unanimously that natural-born citizens **do not have to be born on American soil.**

**Strict constitutionality means we should not bend the document to try to say things that are not there.** The most famous case regarding this is *Lochner vs. New York* (which has been discredited) , which gave people liberty of contract under the first amendment. Note, this is a libertarian position, having that freedom, but both libertarians and conservatives **rallied against it and use it today as an example of judicial activism gone to far because nowhere in the first amendment does it give liberty of contract.**  That is what it means. It also means we should act in the spirit of the law. I fail to see how acting in accordance with a law from the 1790's is against the spirit of the law. 

So why can Ted Cruz run? **because the framers of the constitution said he can.** They defined the word. We are not manipulating **anything.** [It is all there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKG07305CBs). 

Ted Cruz is not bending the constitution, he is not breaking the constitution. Anger at judicial activism is when bending the constitution happens by un-elected judges. Rather he is followed what the framers intended.
