3mp78j,Tensions in Germany regarding migrants. Does this change anyone's views about open borders?,35,RECIPR0C1TY,"[Tensions are on the rise between extremist right and left groups as well as Islamists in Germany since Merkel essentially opened Germany's borders.](http://news.yahoo.com/german-far-mobilising-against-migrants-spy-chief-145317205.htm) Admittedly this is early in Germany's (and Europe's) process of receiving these people; however, this, to me, seems like the natural logical end of open borders. A clash of cultures, a changing of the status quo, and civil unrest as people assert themselves in a new environment creates havoc for a successful, peaceful nation. Is this something that open border proponents expected to see? Is it a surprise and does it change the way you view open borders?
