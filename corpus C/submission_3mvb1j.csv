3mvb1j,How do we know the PP videos were doctored?,130,philly4678,I keep seeing this on r/politics and really any posts that talk about the government shutdown. People keep saying the planned parenthood videos showing the discussion of selling baby parts are doctored by right wing activists. Is there any proof that the videos were doctored? Did someone admit to it? It seems like that is taken as fact around here. ,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mvb1j/how_do_we_know_the_pp_videos_were_doctored/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443553844,1444722106
