Biden is pretty much on the same line path as Barack on virtually every policy issue (as he should--he is VP after all) but an endorsed Warren could help attract some of the voters out of both Hillary and Bernie Sanders camps. 

Warren would attract the people that want vast fiscal policy changes in this country, much like that of Bernie Sanders camp. She would also likely appeal to women voters as a demographic, same can be said for Hillary, but Warren's last name isn't Clinton.

The area for the wall is far too big to patrol. Tripling border patrol might help, but its impossible to effectively cover that much area.

>Europe is a continent so that wouldn't work first. And each country in Europe is smaller than the entire area we are talking about covering.
  
I'm simply making the point that with a wall, it would be very hard to have nearly unbridled migration similar to what's occurring in Europe now. 
  
I think you meant that their border areas are smaller? Probably, especially if they only constructed walls along the likely route. I don't really know how this plays into your argument at all though.

Yes, but the vast majority use a few routes - people generally don't walk days through desert if there are better options. From what I've read, if Trump is elected and he continues to push for this, the wall will likely not extend through the more sparsely populated desert areas. Or if it does, it will be a token wall - the real protection in those areas will be a beefed up border patrol with personnel and drones.
