Obama is engaging in bad-faith negotiations as there is no actual support in the Congress to make the changes & pledges he is publicly making over this climate talks. McConnell's staff is simply informing foreign officials that Obama's promises are most likely going to be hollow as he has not gotten the necessary support in Congress before talking about it. Once a new President comes in they will be free to unilaterally change anything Obama did himself via executive order.

Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude; and Congress itself is powerless to invade it.
