>Too bad CEO pay doesn't equal good governance in the slightest. It's instead reflective of a group of rich people who work to ensure that they and their colleagues remain highly-paid, through a network of old-boys and board memberships.

If that's the case, they will waste their money and the company will eventually fail to a more frugal competitor.  

>If Say on Pay were instituted, you'd see CEO pay drop dramatically, and quickly. If those whose pay drops want to quit - let them. They are replaceable.

It's good to see you know so much about business.  I imagine your a highly successful CEO yourself, with years of experience and education.  Or are you just some dude behind a computer making conjectures about what is best for other people?

Who cares?  They're all getting rich in the meantime!!!  Companies live and die, when you get to the point where your salary and compensation is in the millions (often dozens of millions) of dollars, *you don't care if the company makes it or not.*  It creates perverse incentives to maximize short-term profits at the long-term expense of the company.  Take a look at the financial crisis and you'll see exactly what I mean.

I'm not a CEO, but I am an investor in many large companies who would like to see Say on Pay instituted across the board.  Your response didn't actually address the results of that happening, and is instead an Ad Hominem attack, which isn't impressive.",0,0,1441826524,1444731188

The stockholders care, and they can ultimately fire the CEO if they believe he is doing a bad job or just sucking up money.

There's really nothing to address.  You think you know how to run a billion dollar company and think they are doing it wrong.  I'm not going to waste my time arguing against your vision, it's more effective to just point out that you're probably not qualified to have an opinion on that matter.

cuvxqf4,0,t1_cuvxdxs,Cycloptichorn,"I would say that it's appropriate for the owners of a company to decide upon the compensation for the top employees of a company, yes.  The current system almost always allows a Board of Directors to make that decision and it's actually very, very hard for investors/stockholders to 'fire' the CEO.

Problem is that those Board of Directors are packed full of people who sit on MULTIPLE Boards, and whose colleagues may very well decide their pay, or their friends.  This leads to a system where a small group of people consistently vote to increase the pay of people who are turning around and voting to increase theirs (or their family members, or close friends) in return.  It's not linked to performance of the company in the slightest and there's no evidence whatsoever that high CEO pay leads to high returns on investment for shareholders.  So why should any of us support the current system?

I think the real answer is that you have no good argument to support such a system.

Fun fact, appeal to authority isn't a fallacy if your appeal is to a legitimate authority.  Much like ad hominem isn't a fallacy unless it take the place of an argument.  It's perfectly fine and reasonable to question a person's credentials over highly specialized matters, otherwise every global warming debate would just be ad hominem or appeals to authority.

Yes, but these same people (and their families, and friends) also tend to hold a shit-ton of shares in the companies involved.  Not necessarily enough to control them, or even close in some cases, but certainly enough to ensure that the people they 'like' get put on their boards.

What more, the average 'passive' investor has zero time for the research necessary to be able to make an informed decision, and their fund managers are part of the ol' boys club in many cases themselves.  So, your response here is a flip one and doesn't really answer the question of whether or not Say on Pay would be a more effective policy for controlling and providing appropriate CEO and other top exec compensation than the current buddy-buddy network that has led to staggering rises in CEO pay without staggering (or even statistically provable) rises in returns for investors.

> Fun fact, appeal to authority isn't a fallacy if your appeal is to a legitimate authority. 

Yes, it is.  Always.  It is never a substitute for providing an affirmative or negative argument of your own.  And in any case, you did a reverse one anyway ('you're not an Authority, so your argument is negated') which is definitely a fallacy.

>  Much like ad hominem isn't a fallacy unless it take the place of an argument.

That's what yours did - you didn't talk about the relative merits or lack thereof of 'say on pay,' you merely stated that I wasn't qualified to discuss it at all.  Classic Ad Hominem.

It's never reasonable to question credentials *in place of* providing an argument in opposition of the point the other person is making.  Perhaps I should suggest you study up on your logical fallacies a bit more before making statements about them?",0,0,1441828780,1444731188

Even if so, and mind you we are being a little conspiratorial now, they would then stand to *lose* if the CEO did a bad job.

If it was a more effective policy companies would just use it now.  The fact that they don't suggests that leaving pay open to a completely democratic process is probably a bad idea. 

>Yes, it is. Always.

That's incorrect.  If I ask you to show me evidence that global warming is real, and you send me a link to the 200 top climate experts saying that global warming is real- that qualifies as evidence.  It is not a logical fallacy because it is a *legitimate* authority.  

>That's what yours did - you didn't talk about the relative merits or lack thereof of 'say on pay,' you merely stated that I wasn't qualified to discuss it at all. Classic Ad Hominem.

No.  Ad Hominem would have to be unrelated, for instance  ""Y thinks x is good.""  ""Well, y has a big nose- so x isn't good.""  That's ad hominem.  Asking whether you have the required expertise or education to make your assertion plausible is carries on the argument and is not ad hominem.  

>It's never reasonable to question credentials in place of providing an argument in opposition of the point the other person is making.

You made an assertion based on a bunch of tenuous assumptions, not an argument.

Unprovable assertion, this idea rests on the incorrect assumption that the goal is to benefit all investors instead of a select group.

No - you're incorrect.  The actual *research* done by those 'top climate experts' is the evidence, not their opinions.  And it's not a substitute for you forming and presenting an argument of your own.  In any discussion it's always the duty of one who promotes an argument to provide evidence to support their argument, and saying 'experts agree...' isn't evidence that supports one's arguments at all.

The correctness or incorrectness of one's assertion is not beholden on their education or experience.  This is yet another fallacy.  If an assertion is easily disprovable, it's your responsibility to do so - not to simply attack the utterer as 'uneducated.'

No.  It stems directly from *your* premise that ""these same people (and their families, and friends) also tend to hold a shit-ton of shares.""  You can't have it both ways.  Either these people are shareholders with something to lose or they aren't (and consequently couldn't set up their buddies as CEO).

Once again, it is if the authority is legitmate because not everyone has a PhD in climate related sciences.  If I sat you down and showed you raw evidence for climate change, niether one of us would even begin to understand it because we haven't invested the better part of our adult lives learning how to understand it.

If you're serious, and you don't take the word of scientists as evidence on this matter- do you believe in climate change?  I see no reason why you would, since you've never seen any evidence.  And I don't mean those highly edited and oversimplified charts that only deal with select bits of information.  I mean the real, professional and peer-reviewed studies that confirm the phenomenon.

>The correctness or incorrectness of one's assertion is not beholden on their education or experience.

No, but it does increase the likelihood of an asserting being true or false.

Sure you can.  If you benefit more from the network for BoD seats that ensure you and your friends receive large direct compensation than you do from the higher investment returns you'd get from lower CEO pay, it's in their benefit to do so.  Not even a difficult decision.

The value of shares it would take to be able to place or even influence a CEO in a major corporation isn't even close to a CEOs pay.  You're clutching at straws here.
