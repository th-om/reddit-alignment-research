Joking aside, let me see if I understand correctly: so because China can produce it cheaper we will be able to still produce better products as a result because it frees the money for other things?

That's because the infrastructure to do so was transported to China decades ago *because* of the cheaper labor.

An example of this would be the processing of *rare earth* metals (which aren't really rare, just not in abundance as more basic metals).

Its voracious demand for raw materials has caused prices to spike. Copper prices jumped 37% last year, aluminum and zinc both rose about 25%, and oil was up 33%. In 2003, according to the calculations of Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, the Chinese bought 7% of the world's oil, a quarter of all aluminum and steel, nearly a third of the world's iron ore and coal, and 40% of the world's cement.
