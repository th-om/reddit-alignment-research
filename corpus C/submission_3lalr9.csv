3lalr9,What liability should CEOs and other executives have for their decisions?,45,dragon34,"I heard on the radio this morning that GM, knowing about a defect in their ignition switches for over a decade, elected not to recall them, resulting in 124 deaths.  It was also said that the executives would not be prosecuted.

I'm of the opinion that if an engineer came to a meeting and said ""hey, we've found a problem"" the executives say ""what are the possible outcomes"" and one of them is ""well, the car could turn off on the highway and someone could lose control of their car and die"" and they elect not to recall, they are responsible for those deaths.  I think it's a horrible breach of ethics to say ""well it's probably going to be lest costly to settle with people when someone is killed or injured because of this defect than recall and repair the affected vehicles"" and I think they should be prosecuted, in this case for 124 counts of manslaughter.  (only if they were involved in the decision of course)

I realize that corporations were basically created to limit liability, but I always interpreted it as ""if the business fails and goes bankrupt the owner can still keep their personal assets and not be homeless and starving"" and not ""The business owner can do all sorts of questionably ethical things and have no responsibility for it""
