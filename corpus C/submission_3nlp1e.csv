3nlp1e,Will Bernie Sanders kill what's left of the Socialist movement?,24,GunsOfZapata,"By this point we all know Sanders doesn't want to replace capitalism with a system of worker ownership of production.

A Socialist during a debate brought up an interesting point that while Sanders raises important issues and proposes moderate solutions, the fact that he is running in the Democratic party means if he wins the nomination, he risks breathing new life into a political party that has lost most of it's credibility with moderate voters and ALL of it's credibility with left-wing to far left-wing voters.

If Sanders wins the nomination, could 'Socialist' finally lose any semblance of it's original meaning and simply be replaced with the idea that Socialism is just a few big Welfare programs while at the same time associating a centrist party with 'left-wing' politics, killing off budding left-wing parties like Socialist Alternative?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nlp1e/will_bernie_sanders_kill_whats_left_of_the/,PoliticalDiscussion,1444068437,1444717746
