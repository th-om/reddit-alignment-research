3n7phf,Regarding Nancy Pelosi's refusal to answer a question about abortion,75,down42roads,"Yesterday, Nancy Pelosi was asked a question regarding whether a developed fetus was a human.

She dismissed the question, claiming that her status as a mother gave her more expertise than the male reporter, and that the answer to that question has ""no basis in what public policies that we do here"".

Headlines vary from ""[Nancy Pelosi Confronted by Reporter on Abortion Views](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nancy-pelosi-defends-stance-abortion/story?id=34179647)"" to[ ""Nancy Pelosi rebukes reporter over 'unborn baby' question""](http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/01/politics/nancy-pelosi-abortion-question-unborn-baby/index.html) to more polarizing ones like ""[Nancy Pelosi Wants Male Reporter To Stop Telling Her What Happens In Women's Bodies](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-male-reporter_560d8e3ee4b0af3706e00122)"" and ""[Nancy Pelosi Seemingly Caught Off Guard by Reporter’s Blunt Abortion Question — See Her Reaction](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/10/01/nancy-pelosi-seemingly-caught-off-guard-by-reporters-blunt-abortion-question-see-her-reaction/)"".

Each link contains video of the incident.

My two questions:

1) Is it appropriate for female politicians to refuse questions based on the gender of the questioner?

2) How should we feel about a politician declaring that the status of the fetus provides no basis for abortion policy?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3n7phf/regarding_nancy_pelosis_refusal_to_answer_a/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443783936,1444720674
