3kceuy,"My father made a good point, that I don't know how to counter or fully understand, regarding outsourcing labor.",42,thecrazytexan,"My father and I were discussing child labor factories. I was saying how I had stopped shopping at Gap and the likes when he said that I should do the opposite. 
His point paraphrased: ""My company hired engineers from China for less than $10/hr, they continued to do so until all the other engineering firms opened offices in China as well, now they earn over $50/hr. They did this because the demand for labor went up. If you stop buying clothes those kids that earn shit will continue to earn shit, then lose their jobs and only source of income.""

Here are factors I am considering:  
1. Maybe there are too many needy people to ever create a lack of cheap labor  
2. I'm ignoring the argument that ""Americans need to keep jobs in America"" because I am ignoring patriotism. If there is a better reason for having this argument then pride, lmk.   

Thoughts?
