>Rand Paul made a good point in agreeing with you, that there is no evidence that spreading out the vaccines is inherently better, but I think it is a reasonable liberty to grant people. 

I didn't say it wasn't, but how spread out do you or Carson mean? An unvaccinated kid is an unvaccinated kid (lowering heard immunity and leaving that child at risk.) Until they are not.  You don't need to press that with antivaxxer parents if you are trying to coax them toward full vaccination slowly, but it has not merit when dealing with the general public.

>Vaccinations are a thing and they will happen, 

Plenty of wackos choose not to vaccinate their kids. Dangerous childhood diseases are on the comeback.  For once ’think of the children' is literally a valid argument.

>so might as well do it in a way that makes people more comfortable with them.

As a strategy to get antivaxxer parents to vaccinate - a psychological trick, it might have some merit.  But not as a legitimate suggestion for parents who aren't morons.

Other times I thought the CNN moderators were like that one drunk friend who is trying to egg you on into a fight with some random guy at the bar.  ""hey, did you hear what Mike said about your proposal dawg?! He said 'it ain't crap'.  Now! Whatcha gonna do about it?!"" (read in [Luther, Obama's anger interpreter's voice](https://video.search.yahoo.com/video/play?p=anger+translator&back=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.yahoo.com%2Fyhs%2Fsearch%3Fp%3Danger%2Btranslator%26ei%3DUTF-8%26hsimp%3Dyhs-002%26hspart%3Dmozilla&fr=%26fr%3Dyhs-mozilla-002&turl=http%3A%2F%2Fts2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DWN.J7aVwGYoeoO1UjiOOEGY7A%26pid%3D15.1&rurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-qv7k2_lc0M&tit=Key+%26+Peele+-+Obama%26%2339%3Bs+Anger+Translator+-+Meet+Luther&l=168&vid=06ffc6f780cd63279c3bd682d7b3d314&sigr=11b75sbph&sigb=12s7snicj&sigt=11oumn8st&sigi=11vr5srts&hspart=mozilla&hsimp=yhs-002))

I did like how they allowed the debate on foreign policy to play out.  Plus, the fact that it was free to stream really helped me in my ability to watch it.  When all was said and done the moderators seemed genuinely trying to get the stances of most of the candidates out to the public.  

I will admit though I laughed a lot when the moderator said, ""Mr. Trump, you still haven't answered my question on XXX.""  and then would go on to a candidate that had a legitimate response like Fiorina or Paul.  If the first twenty minutes weren't an indicator.  CNN's entire purpose of that debate was to call out what Trump has been saying and show the flaws in his ~~plans~~ misleading statements.",19,0,1442606304,1444726970

The questions have been ratings based, not substantive at all, and the moderators have come across childishly.  I'm very disappointed so far.  I have always watched the debates very closely, and this is a sideshow by comparison to any past debate.  The main FOX debate was pathetic (although the early debate was very good).  The CNN one was only marginally better.  Some of the candidates have done well for themselves, so people are still at least shuffling the poll numbers and making a competition of it.  But, as for substance, there's nothing here.  The low point of both debates was Megyn Kelly's contemptuous and pissy behavior, but even other moderators who have acted more like adults still haven't been able to keep their focus on anything that matters.  It's one thing to be adversarial.  You should be, and passionately so.  It's another to forget how to appear dignified in your position.  

It's always the third debate that starts getting into more detailed policy questions, but that's because that's typically where the field narrows to a point to allow for that sort of thing.  But, this Republican field is so well funded all around it's hard to see the field narrowing enough to facilitate better conversations at this point.

Those who answer get +10 points, or -5 if they do not answer. Those who didn't answer will be at the mercy of journalists voting on whether they answered orally. If they get the microphone, and if they did not answer, a panel of at least 10 journalists votes on whether the questions were  answered orally (+1) or not (-1), for a point total between +10 and -10. Non votes default to zero points.

The questions are proposed and voted on in a public open forum like reddit AMAs, and available beforehand. The most popular questions are asked first.  A question may call for selecting one or two choices, or for sorting the choices in order of preference. Questions specific to one or two candidates do not belong in a debate, and can be asked in an interview instead.

Those with the lowest scores get less time to talk or are less likely to be picked to speak. A computer  turns off the microphone automatically when their time is up. ",0,0,1442683134,1444726998
