Basically, something has to be done about mass shootings and gun violence in general.

But factually speaking, no gun control legislation that I'm aware of would actually make much of a difference, other than presenting a burden to the millions of people who own and use firearms responsibly.",5,0,1442979228,1444725197

cvbl2qv,0,t1_cvb00ao,avatoin,"This is me. I used to hate guns. Now I think a lot of the calls for national gun control are stupid. But I still think that too many guns in the hands of criminals is bad. But I have no idea what can actually help. Do we start arresting people for possession of a gun? Do we essentially have the police maintain a military style occupation of violent areas in cities? Do we do nothing, tell neighborhoods to form a militia and wage war on the violent gangs? Or do just we pass laws that just make it harder for non-criminals to get guns, while doing nothing new about the criminals?",1,0,1443030536,1444725201

The colorado AWB was about 10%

cvbh2j5,0,t1_cvb1ka3,Sollexs,"That, or we could try to figure out the root of why these crimes are happening. Gang related violence is the biggest amount of firearm homicides for one. For two, we will never have 0 because so long as there are different people, there are people who will kill others for seeming no or little reason regardless of weapon accessibility.

For the school shootings, we could stop making them 'anti-heros' via the 24/7 news media, that would probably cut down on them as they are in large part copycat crimes by suicidal people who wish to  be knowen. If the news reported a shooting as 'Another shooting at X place happend today, Y ammount dead, Here are some of the victims.' and never show the face of the shooter, name or dive into their life story to 'see what went wrong', There will be less incentive to suicide while mass killing. Granted they will still probably happen as they have been since the 1800s, just back to less of them over all.


Gun control advocates are trying to take the 'easy' way out to solve these problems, they are targeting a tool, its like using a medicine to alleviate the symptoms instead of the medicine that will actually heal you, all while going after law abiding people because getting them from criminals is quite hard, The democrats just use gun control for political clout that they can use against people who are ignorant about firearms. (Case in point, the assault weapons bans. Don't get me started on the term 'assault weapon' but there are about 48 murders a year with rifles that the democrats classify as such, statistically nothing in the scope of our nation, yet they are trying hard to get them banned. Logic need not apply.)",1,0,1443024781,1444725201

cvb4t8b,0,t1_cvazxv1,thatnameagain,"I'm somewhat in the same boat. The issue for me is the lack of information that can realistically be made available about the ""general intentions"" of immigrants in any given circumstance. I think immigration has been shown to be beneficial to countries in the long term, but there are plenty of cases showing the opposite. 

I'm concerned about the lack of depth in discussion about immigration. People talk about it like a bean-counting game, where basically higher numbers are bad. There's more to it than numbers, especially when it comes to cultural assimilation and the economic factors in play. Anyways, I think the jury is out on whether it's more or less likely that immigration is good or bad overall, on average, and that's frustrating. ",1,0,1442992915,1444725201
