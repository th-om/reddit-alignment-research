Also a lot of those banks bought toxic assets but the toxicity of the assets was deliberately masked to them. It's not like every bank was in on creating the bubble. 

The government played a far, far bigger role in creating the bubble than any single bank, should we have sacked our government too? Governments have been bailing out banks in financial crises for *thousands of years* because it's the best way to fix the problem. 

Is it fair? No. Should banks be too big to fail? No. But if they *are* too big to fail, you better fucking bail them out. ",-1,0,1442250963,1444729020

cv1c3xl,0,t1_cv1bvkj,Dynamaxion,"The modern US banking industry is so far from anything resembling a free market it's almost a joke to reference the term. 

Some of banks should be punished. But they're smart and make it extremely hard to prove who was and was not perpetuating fraud and a victim of the fraud. Even the US government itself both bought into and encouraged the housing bubble. 

Plenty of banks, if I recall correctly, did fail and were bought out by others. But it's definitely not fair for those same finance types to be richer than they ever were while normal people's lives are ruined. It's the same situation in Greece. The banks made a shit investment and doesn't want to take any losses, to the extent that they'll put every Greek into a life of hell to ensure that they're paid back in full. 

The fuckup was made long ago when we let such banks get big and influential enough to where we all owe our retirement and jobs to their solvency. The time to fix the problem is times like this, when there *isn't* a financial crisis. Right now is when you can force them to break up and such with minimal fallout to everyone else.

cv1b0lx,1,t3_3kx7b7,prinzplagueorange,"There is no serious problem with poor quality teachers.  Schools that have seriously low test scores are ones that are full of poor students and students who do not speak English as a first language.  You would expect that those schools would have low test scores as the students' parents are under a lot of economic stress and do not have much time to devote to their children.  The so-called educational reformers understand this perfectly well, but do not care because they want to bust unions.  High school education is generally pathetic compared to college classes, but college professors have academic freedom, the ability to fail students who don't do their work, students who have chosen to attend school, and a lot of disciplinary training. High school teachers do not have these things.  The best way to improve is to eliminate poverty and then wait a few decades.  It wouldn't hurt to require high school teachers to have an MA in their content and to show them the appropriate amount of respect.",0,0,1442249810,1444729020
