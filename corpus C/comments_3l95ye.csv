That's all you have to do: Hold on. 

With just 4 people in the first debate, you've got the underdogs getting a larger share of the airtime. You can either break into the 2nd debate like Carly did, or outlast other people as they drop out.

Jindal like did a good job appealing to the conservative wing. We'll see who comes out ahead. Personally I think Graham will leap frog over Jindal and Paul.

As for Santorum and Pataki, they seem like they're becoming more and more irrelevant. Santorum seemed all over the place (although his talk about min wage workers was good) and Pataki appeared far too moderate.",3,0,1442463763,1444727742

The one about being a terrible law student and never having spent so much time in a library before left me feeling like if they panned around the audience, there would have been a lot of people going ""ohhh... oh my."" Public self-deprecating humor doesn't seem particularly presidential to me on any topic more serious than, like, interior decorating skills (or other such things that have nothing to do with actually running a country).

Also, when you own a small business your property might be worth a bunch, but you're probably renting it or paying out a ton in property tax. They also grew up in the back room of the bar, and its pretty hard to get income or operate a bar while in college.

If they had been rich, they probably would have grown up in a house. 

He joined the military because it was basically the only way he could attend college and still provide for his sister who he adopted. 

So I'd say it was a pretty amazing life story, and if he wasn't poor before, he definitely was when his parents died.  ",3,0,1442462144,1444727753
