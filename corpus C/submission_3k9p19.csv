3k9p19,Why I think we need Bernie Sanders. Your thoughts?,24,VanGoghingSomewhere," I want more conjecture sob stories that pull my heart strings, completely out of the context of the issue. I also would like some magical free healthcare with no waiting lists, and for wealthy people to give me their money. I want to see a united states where I can have more than I don't work for, and pay less taxes than the people whose taxes pay my bills. Also in order to stabilize the world economy and state of foreign governments, I want all of our troops to miraculously disappear from all foreign countries, and come be gay at home where they can be happily married.
