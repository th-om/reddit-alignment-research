3k6t2w,"With all the current Planned Parenthood controversy, and that concerning it's history, is it time to ditch it in favor of an alternative?",54,theartchitect,"Quick backdrop: I am male who is pro-choice, who understands there are times when this procedure needs to be available for women anywhere in the country. 

So, I tried to read into the history of Planned Parenthood and how it operates (minus the the current selling/distributing of organs controversy) so as to possibly convince myself that maybe there are just a few bad seeds in an otherwise needed fruit. However, upon my initial research, I find that the origins of PP stem from controversial pre WW1 eugenics and a founder who is steeped in moral quandary and racism. It has been given extensive connections and privileges within the US GVT and has not been subject to much public oversight. Is it time to start finding solutions that are oversought by the public? Do we need the GVTto fund and pass legislation for this kind of program anymore? I believe that free markets allow the consumer the best possible product/service, because other products/services will naturally get beaten out (the same way we should let some businesses/banks fail, because another better one should pop up in it's place, without GVT or political interference). Is it time to start answering some of our social dilemmas with programs free from GVT interference, especially the case of Planned Parenthood?

NOTE: I know this is a hot topic, a political wedge, and when a male speaks out about this, it can hit some as primitive chauvinism, but I have been directly affected and am deeply emotional about the subject. Currently it seems some media types would outcast me as ""Against abortion"" because I am leaning against PP, but I am exactly the opposite. I want a safer, morally-less-conflicting alternative,  available to EVERY woman in EVERY state, out of the reach of profit and politic. Please consider this when responding.
