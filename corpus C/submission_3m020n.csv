3m020n,"""A military so powerful that no one would dare test us."" I often hear similar statements made by politicians. But the US spends more on the military than every other country combined!",27,Weenercopter,"Why do so many politicians go on about this?  

A quick search will lead you to numerous articles.  A couple quick and interesting facts:

* The US spends over $600 billion a year on military.  The next highest is China, spending over $150 billion a year. (The numbers vary, depending on your source, but it holds true that the US spends more than everyone else combined.)
* The US has more aircraft carriers than every other country combined (and my understanding is that those other carriers aren't nearly as impressive or versatile).

We could continue making lists, and we'd find countless other ""more than every other country combined"" stats.  

Anyway, why do we keep hearing this stuff?  The way some politicians talk about it, our military consists of a few horses, some bayonets, and an old old wooden ship used in the Civil War era.  

Do we need such a huge military?  Will we really weaken ourselves if we cut our budget by $300 billion--and still outspend every other individual country?  

And forgive me if I'm coming across as ignorant.  Foreign relations and military affairs are not my bread and butter. 

Anyway, please keep it clean, and play nice.  I'd love to hear what you think.
