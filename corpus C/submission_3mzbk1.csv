3mzbk1,What could possibly go wrong?,22,decatur8r,"It looks like John Boehner's ""noble effort"" will work. And the congress will pass a clean CR.

There by saving the GOP from what I and it seems Mr. Boehner think, would be political suicide. 

(Some may disagree and we can talk about this below.)

But the question here is at what cost?

All this saved was a 60 to 90 day window. At the same time it added a few more explosive items to the mix.

To start with there is the transportation bill.

Then there is the budget...that we put off today.

Then there is the really scary one... the debt ceiling.

Roll all this together and add new leadership... McCarthy is inexperienced and will have the same choice that Boehoner had...work with the Democrats...or work with the Raucous caucus.

If he works with the Dems the right will start after him...if he works with the right...the lights go off.

The new majority leader (McCarthy's old job.) will most likley be part of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Caucus And then there is the rest of the leadership team. The whip choice will be interesting

Putting an even more ominous spin on all of this.

What do you all think will happen here?
