All else equal, I would enjoy a world where politicians could just speak their mind instead of having carefully tailored messages based on polls.

Say you have 2 candidates: Bill and Bob. Bill speaks his mind, while Bob communicates in a way that's less open/honest, trying to follow what his staff's analysis of polls suggested will work best. Bob supports policies that would make the world a better place than the policies that Bill supports. I would prefer the communication style of Bill, but I would want Bob to be elected.

> I would say that the quality of life on earth based on nepotism, cronyism and corruption is on a slow steady decline

Based on what? By every measure, quality of life in our lifetime is higher than it has ever been.

> the bubble that protects the West from its ramifications could pop at any minute especially considering the environmental impact that this unchecked way of life has already wrought (ie CA drought and wildfire; Syrian drought/refugee situation).

CA drought/wildfire are just part of nature, and the water shortage can be easily solved by better policy. The Syrian war is bad, but total violence is at a very low point compared to human history.

They're not 

Trump and Sanders are both riding the ""we're not part of the machine and thus are unbridled by political realities"" wave that the other candidates have to play with. This is the part of the election where the candidates play to their more idealistic and extreme views of their respective parties. They'll eventually have to tone it down and then get swept under the rung of people who actually know what they're talking about. 

The reason Trump is doing so well is that he has by far, the most name recognition of any candidate (outside of the Clinton machine). The man is a character, he's unbridled, he's a ""say what you want"" kind of guy that appeals to a lot of people. This time of year,  ",0,0,1442348623,1444728131
