cvcqojy,1,t3_3m7w2z,lmaoo-sure,"Marco Rubio needs to connect with the average Republican base member. He, much like Trump and Fiorina, needs to touch on the anger the base feels towards government and the GOP establishment. Given that he is a member of Congress and not a Tea Party firebrand, this will prove especially hard. I guess someone else can better delve into what strategy is the best when trying to shed the weight of being an establishment career politician. His mastery of foreign policy is a double edged sword. On one hand, it's great that he's ready to be Commander in Chief on day one. On the other, his hawkish foreign policy will earn him the blessing of the establishment king makers, which means the base could see him as Jeb 2.0, and turn on him.",3,0,1443114117,1444724660

* Cultivate a cult of personality with very short ingratiating speaches and appearances in key locations for the nomination

* Stay.On.Message. Learn from Obama and be sure to always keep to a script and only speak extemporaneously at the debates or very carefully selected audiences

* Give empty platitudes with a sincere voice, talk about the importance of families, amurrica, and business

* Appear above the fray by not engaging in any debate that doesn't give him a clear win, so only speak when sure its the right thing to say.

* Give small speeches always. Organize rallies and stumps so that the audience is in too small an arena and be sure to rally the crowd before a very short speech with long pause afterward for applause and then quickly leave

* Cultivate media members sympathetic to Rubio and carefully go on a charm offensive with media. Wine and dine them, massage their egos, and be sure to be subtle and discreet when possible.

* Organize small action groups in important latino communities for the nomination that would pass out fliers and do small scale electioneering reach-out.

* Create small postive news stories to constantly keep Rubio's name in the news in a positive way. He needs to be a bro to a broken down car he stopped for on the bus tour, he needs to buy a dude lunch whose luggage was lost in transit at the airport, he needs to be active in activities that people approve of.",6,0,1443114419,1444724660
