cvcgxow,0,t1_cvcgvs9,KeyzerSozee,I think I agree. What do you see as the best ticket for both sides with that said?,1,0,1443097871,1444724718
cvch0m0,0,t1_cvcgxow,ClockOfTheLongNow,"Well, Walker's gone, so I really don't know.  Rubio and some sort of executive (maybe Walker, maybe Kasich) seems to be the most obvious choice right now.",1,0,1443098074,1444724718
cvch5ht,0,t1_cvch0m0,KeyzerSozee,I think Walker (on top of not having any money) had the thought of being a VP candidate in the back of his mind and didn't want to sour the potential nominee,1,0,1443098407,1444724718
cvcrozo,0,t1_cvcgvs9,avatoin,"This, elections are more about turn out. At best independents are party voters who need a little more encouragement to get out and vote. The number of true undecideds is much smaller than the number of claimed independents. ",3,0,1443115581,1444724718
cvcgxdv,1,t3_3m6vsd,joecity856,"First off Democrats would not be better off because their voters are more uniform on issues and a more left candidate would cause a divide. 

Republicans might be better off because I believe the way to get Republicans to win the election is to get more evangelicals out to vote. I think only 65% of people who identify as evangelical voted at all and 75% of them voted Republican, even if that number went up 5-10 percentage points Romney would have won.

cvch0m7,0,t1_cvcgxdv,KeyzerSozee,"So you think the Republicans would benefit from having a more conservative, more evangelical candidate on the ticket? ",1,0,1443098074,1444724718
cvch2a3,0,t1_cvch0m7,joecity856,"I am not sure, but recently there was all this stuff about the Latino vote and how the Republicans needs 60% to win. I think it is a much easier path to have more evangelicals simply go to the polls.

cvch4fi,0,t1_cvch2a3,KeyzerSozee,I agree. I think the best chance for the Republicans to win is to nominate Rubio and have an evangelical as VP,1,0,1443098338,1444724718
cvci5n0,1,t3_3m6vsd,Lambchops_Legion,"Neither. A VP is almost never picked to ""balance.""

The last 5 winning vice presidents (Bush, Quayle, Gore, Cheney, Biden) have been picked because they had DC experience and a valued opinion in the White House.

Clinton, a southern dem, picked another southern dem as his VP. Bush II chose the his dad's former Chief of Staff. Biden was one of the most senior senators.",1,0,1443100658,1444724718
cvco2mc,0,t1_cvci5n0,lightmonkey,"Bush was a unity ticket after Reagan didn't like Ford's proposal for a co-presidency in response to being offered the VP slot. 

Quayle was an attempt at appealing to the younger, conservative, ""Reagan Revolution"" crowd. Bush was in his mid 60s and Reagan had been in his late 70s leaving office.

Gore  was stronger on family vaules and the environment, he also balanced it out as being more of an intellectual. 

Cheney wasn't picked primarily for it, but he did at foreign policy experience and intellectualism. 

Biden was an experienced statesman popular with working class voters to balance out the Obama's inexperience and intellectualism. 


VPs balance out the ticket in some way, just not necessarily ideologically.
