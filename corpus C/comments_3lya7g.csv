The voter base is still overwhelmingly white compared to democrats. Most would agree that the heavy, outspoken racists (who are diminishing, but still exist) are largely southern and conservative.  

That's not to mention that those candidates really don't hold the standard views that most of their minority does.  Uncle Tom has terrible connotations behind it, but the premise (a black among whites who agrees with the whites instead of his fellow blacks) does ring fairly true for Carson.  He is also often propped up as ""this black guy made it big, so you can too!"", although that's not his fault nor his doing.  

Fiornia is honestly barely worth mentioning.  She's the flavor of the month candidate that got popular because of a couple decent shots she got in on trump.

But he really doesn't represent black interests, and yes, that's so simply because he's a republican.  It's not that the GOP is purposefully against what blacks are for because those ideals are what blacks are for, but they are against them nonetheless.  

The point I'm trying to argue is that, the only difference between Carson and any other evangelical candidate is that he's black.  It'd be too complicated to use actual opinions so I'll just use letters.  The average black voter toes the democrat party line and has opinion A on questions 1, 2, and 3 (which is a issue that affects blacks directly).  The average republican has opinion B.

A very salient point and I say this as someone who would probably eat shards of glass before voting for the GOP on a national level.  Their base is very white and very evangelical and very middle-aged and that is going to be a demographic albatross for them in the years to come, but it's overly reductive to say that the Republican Party exists solely to cater to the whims of that demographic.   I may disagree with vast swathes of their platform but they do sincerely want to reach out to minorities and shore up their gender gap for the same reason the Democrats do - votes, votes, votes.

I had a Facebook friend from high school who's a GOP blogger/shill and he said that their outreach efforts suck.  I don't disagree with that.  Nor do I disagree with the GOP talking point that Democrats generally take the minority vote (especially the black vote) for granted.  I certainly do sideeye the inevitable corollary statement that it's the liberal media conspiring to play gotcha games to keep the minorities on the Democratic plantation.   The media has a sensationalism bias, not a liberal one.  I hate CNN too, but if they're looking for a gaffe to knock out of the park and you keep slow-lobbing them across home plate, that's on you, not the media.

The Democrats currently enjoy an advantage with voters of color because its base demographic and party positions (whatever those are) are more appealing in aggregate.  They may not have earned their minority votes, but thanks to the GOP they haven't had to. 

I do think the GOP can and will reinvent itself to be more appealing to minority voters in 20-24years when 2042 becomes a reality and they can no longer rely on Democratic incompetence to cycle back into power.  But 2042 is not 2016.",7,0,1442955497,1444725314

Also, I could be wrong, but Mormonism doesn't have anyone similar to David Koresh. David Koresh was the leader of a Seventh Day Adventist group that holed themselves up in Waco, TX and engaged in armed combat with the US government, resulting in a number of people being killed.

It may not be fair or accurate to compare Carson to David Koresh, but all is fair in love and war, and politics is war, and if I was a politcal opponent of Carson, I would make sure there was 24/7 attack ads connecting the two toegther.

[In the 2012 Republican primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_2012) the top four candidates garnered 18.8 million votes. To allow for other candidates not in the top 4, I'll round it up to 20 million voters in 2012, and assume that'll be roughly the number voting in 2016 primaries.

[The Pew Research poll on religious affiliation](http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/) estimates about 25.4% of people are Evangelicals. But [they also noted in another study](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/02/02/trends-in-party-identification-of-religious-groups-affiliation/) that evangelicals trended toward the Republican party roughly 3:1. So instead of 5 million people being Evangelical Republican voters, I'll round it up (because I'm too lazy to do math) to 8.5 million, rather arbitrarily.

I polled 1 of these Evangelical Republican voters, my stepdad, and he said he'd vote for Carson.

[Using this sample size calculator](http://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm) with a 95% confidence level, a sample size of 1, a total population of 8.5 million, and leaving the percentage at 50%, I see that my confidence interval is 98%.

Therefore I conclude that 100% of the evangelical support will go toward Carson, but +/- 98%. So anywhere from 2% to 198% of evangelical voters will go for Carson.

That said, a lot of what people consider to be the ""Christian right"" is really a thinly veiled attempt at a using/misusing scripture to support whatever goal they are trying to achieve.  u/EatHumans touches on this subject with the [overwhelmingly racist reaction to Obama](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lya7g/rick_santorum_carried_11_states_in_2012_due_in/cvag0rj).

There are aspects of the Christian Right and center that lean towards republican views and weigh statements with scripture and see if what is said matches with their faith instead of matching their faith to what has been said.  Sadly, these are a very quite group and are often drowned out by the sensationalism of extreme right, and a controversy hungry media.

there is even scriptural references to this:
Matt Chapter 7

> “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’

So to answer your question, If by ""evangelical vote"" you mean people that hide behind scripture to pursue their own means, I'm inclined to say Huckabee, Carson, Maybe Fionia (because of her opposition to drugs).
