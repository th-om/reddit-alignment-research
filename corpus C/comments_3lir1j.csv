cv8n6hd,1,t3_3lir1j,Humanatee69,"People seem to misunderstand the bill being passed by Japan. This is from the Japanese constitution:

>...the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. (Article 9)

What is being passed is a reinterpretation of how Japan can protect its own land, which is what their military is permitted to do. The bill looks to enable Japan to go overseas if it is necessary to protect its own country. Attacking or invading other countries or joining unrelated conflicts is still forbidden.

On top of this, over 2/3 of Japanese people aggressively oppose this. I was skyping my father in Tokyo yesterday and could hear the protesters despite the fact that he lives quite a few blocks away from the DIET Building. 

All this to say, I could see Abe weaseling this bill all the way through, but don't expect it to lead to war in East Asia. There will be tons of posturing from China and the Koreas regarding this move, but armed conflict is still very unlikely. It is sad to see a core component of the Japanese constitution reinterpreted against the will of the people, but this is a far cry from the reemergence of a warmongering Japan.

We're speaking relatively the same thing.  The only disagreement I had was in regards to your statement:

*After 9/11 the US expressed support for the Japanese to have any involvement overseas and Japan accommodated by adjusting their Constitution to allow for military support roles outside of their territorial defense.*

Japan has provided support in military roles, though non-combat, way before 9/11 and even did so afterwards.
