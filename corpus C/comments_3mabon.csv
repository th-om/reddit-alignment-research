Many libertarians are objectivists, and some objectivists are libertarians; but is not an automatic overlap.

You have a very ""edgy teenager"" view of Republicans. The fact of the matter is that the world runs on selfishness/greed. People are most motivated when they're working for their own ends. Democrats don't encourage generations of dependence on government assistance out of the goodness of their heart. They do so because it establishes a very secure voting block that they can pay lip service to without ever really having to listen to them (because they lack the economic resources to impact elections like the rich do). I'd also love to see where in the Constitution it says that government's role is to subsidize the lifestyles of the American people. Government (Federal) was largely founded to protect Americans from external military threats and establish unalienable rights. There was never the assumption that government's job was to be a quasi-charity organization for the less savvy or innovative among the population. I won't argue with you on the religious nuts point. As far as war-mongers, I'd point out that there are hawkish people on both sides of the isle. Hillary Clinton is a notorious hawk.

>Domestically, they don't believe in anything but making as much money as possible. If some jackass like Donald Trump makes billions of dollars while others starve to death they think it's good. Greed is their mantra. Their Neo-Conservative foreign policy terrifies me. We saw how that worked with George W. Bush and his cronies. I think most Republicans are ignorant science deniers as well.

You do understand that most Republican politicians are wealthy businessmen, right? If they truly cared about nothing more than making money, they'd never leave the private sector. What does Donald Trump's success have to do with other people starving to death? Why does admiring Trump's business success mean (in your mind) condoning the circumstances that allow other to fall into such desperate states of poverty? Would it be better if we were *all* starving? No complaints when it comes to your condemnation of neocons. 

>On the other hand, I see Democrats as being delusional humanists that think everyone is good and that we should open our borders to every barely literate biped that walks the Earth. I believe the Democrats are all about lifting women, minorities and the handicapped above traditional Americans like myself. Their foreign policy is much less insane than Republicans, generally speaking. They want to kill a whole lot less people.

Their foreign policy is full on capitulation to the powers that be in the world. They're delusional when it comes to the threat of radical Islam and refuse to accept the fact that diplomacy will not stop rogue states that destabilize entire regions of the world in order to further their economic, militaristic, and religious agenda. If democrats are about uplifting minorities then why are minorities doing so poorly in the states that have traditionally been run by Democrats? If they're about uplifting women, why do they propagate the false narrative that women's problems are the result of some shadowy patriarchy, secretly scheming to keep women down at every turn? 

>I see libertarians as being the extreme selfishness of the Republican party combined with the delusion that government only does bad. If they had their way, every human would live in a bubble and our economy would probably collapse. Their Ayn Rand domestic vision is horrifying. It would be selfishness to the extreme.

A libertarian state would require high levels of voluntarism and charity to properly function, making libertarians inherently the least selfish of all political groups.

>What am I to do? I usually try to vote for the less crazy candidate but if I have to choose between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush or Donald Trump I may stop participating in our political process.

Just don't vote. You have very generalized and downright offensive views of every major political philosophy.

Por que no los dos? 

Something that is politically successful isn't necessarily only supported out of political necessity. I've literally never heard a Democrat talk about a desire to create welfare programs in order to encourage dependence. You accuse OP of having an ""edgy teenager"" view of Republicans, but I think you have much the same view of Democrats.

Um, Obama is a Democrat, remember? He hasn't exactly sat idle on the whole issue of Islamic terrorism. Lots of drone strikes and  killed Osama bin Laden.

And if you are bitter about the Iran deal, how exactly is negotiating with a smallish country that destabilize entire regions of the world in order to further their economic, militaristic, and religious agenda different from negotiations held in the past with the USSR, a superpower that destabilized entire regions of the world in order to further their economic, militaristic, and ideological agenda? The USSR genuinely was a serious threat to the USA, but we didn't threaten bomb their nuclear facilities. Iran, even a nuclear Iran, is not and can never be an existential threat to our country. It's a bargain to be able to get these sorts of concessions from Iran for free.

> If democrats are about uplifting minorities then why are minorities doing so poorly in the states that have traditionally been run by Democrats?

Can I point out that this is a correlation, not causation sort of thing? A state with a lot of minorities doing poorly is probably going to tend to support whichever party has policies better for minorities.

But in the case of encouraging generations (usually of minorities) to depend on government assistance, it clearly is. Democrats need the minority vote and keeping minorities in a state of perpetual poverty allows them to blame the ""evil"" Republicans without every allowing them rise up the economic ladder and risk losing them to conservatives. 

>I've literally never heard a Democrat talk about a desire to create welfare programs in order to encourage dependence. You accuse OP of having an ""edgy teenager"" view of Republicans, but I think you have much the same view of Democrats. 

You've also never heard Republicans say they're going to exploit religious zealots who don't know how our constitution works to get votes. You're incredibly naive if you think parties discuss their dirty tricks with the public.

>Um, Obama is a Democrat, remember? He hasn't exactly sat idle on the whole issue of Islamic terrorism. Lots of drone strikes and killed Osama bin Laden.

Is that why Obama's war on ISIS is being [deemed a failure] (http://observer.com/2015/09/obamas-collapsing-war-on-the-islamic-state/) by respectable sources? Drone strikes only exacerbate the issue of Islamic extremism. If your brother happens to be in the same region as a terrorist and is killed via American drone strike, you're way more likely to side with the religious extremists in your country than with the US government. As for Bin Laden, he was practically a prisoner in Pakistan already. A Pakistani official was the one who tipped off the US government in order to claim the reward. Obama played no role other than calling for an attack on a sitting duck. He also rushed the announcement of Bin Laden's death. They were going to frame it as a drone strike so the Pakistani government wouldn't take any heat from the extremists for snitching to the US government.

Haha. So I should only get my information from the people propagating the false narrative, right?

No. I made no assumptions that it would properly work. I said that *for* it to properly work (as in, in accordance with their beliefs) people would need to be more unselfish than in any current western democracy.

>I think OP is talking about rampant selfishness in an attempted, but failed libertarian society. 

Of course there would be rampant selfishness in a **failed** libertarian society. That's why a successful libertarian society (**like I said**) would require people to be mainly unselfish. Since libertarians want a **successful** libertarian society, they're unselfish.

>If you need all citizens to be unselfish for your society to work...

You don't need *all* citizens to be unselfish for a libertarian society to work, you just need those with a significant amount of disposable income to be willing to give some of it to charity.

I think you'd see a drastic rise in charity if people knew it was going directly to those in need and not a corrupt bureaucracy. ",0,0,1443159814,1444724298

They were going to frame an operation that had accidentally left a stealth helicopter behind as a drone strike?

No, I'm not saying it is random chance. You have done *nothing* to establish that Democratic leadership makes the cities worse off. The alternative is that minorities in situations that are terrible will vote for the party that is more likely to support policies that help a bit. No mayor of Detroit is going to be able to bring back heavy industry and totally fix the city, but a Democratic mayor could pass policies that are more friendly to disadvantaged minorities and be a more popular choice than a Republican mayor.

> Haha. So I should only get my information from the people propagating the false narrative, right?

If you haven't actually learned what serious feminists actually mean when they talk about patriarchy, how can you say that it is a false narrative? I agree with you that a narrative about men secretly scheming to keep women down would be a false narrative, but that is not what 'patriarchy' means in this context. 

> Since libertarians want a successful libertarian society, they're unselfish.

The counterargument would be to say that a libertarian is being unrealistic if they think that they could make people more unselfish than in any current western democracy, therefore they can't realistically think that a libertarian society could succeed, so continuing to advocate for libertarian policies is, in fact, advocating for an almost certainly *failed* libertarian society which would feature rampant selfishness.

> People are reluctant to pay higher taxes because they fear it going to an incompetent government

Really? Or are people reluctant to pay higher taxes because having more money is better than having less?

> I think you'd see a drastic rise in charity if people knew it was going directly to those in need and not a corrupt bureaucracy.

To *some* charities. To the 'sexy' ones. You might get plenty of funding for charities that care for orphaned children, but drug rehab programs or facilities for housing the severely mentally ill are going to be woefully underfunded. It's just how human psychology and advertising (a key part of fundraising) works. An orphaned child is more likely to evoke sympathy than a smelly, unshaven, erratic homeless man.

>I was challenging your statement that Democrat's foreign policy is "" full on capitulation to the powers that be in the world."" How is trying to do something and (maybe) failing capitulating?

If you don't make a genuine attempt at doing something, it is akin to capitulation. Obama downplayed ISIS' growing strength (JV squad) and refused to send in ground troops against them. He lifted the embargo on Cuba without getting any true promise of change form the Castros. He drew a red line for Syria and then did nothing when Syria crossed it. He let Putin take over Ukraine. He's done nothing to stop the repeated hacking at the hands of the Chinese and Russian governments that have left many people in our military and intelligence communities in hams way.

**Obviously** the plan was in place before the helicopter crash.

>No, I'm not saying it is random chance. You have done nothing to establish that Democratic leadership makes the cities worse off. 

Except for the fact that the cities being led by Democrats are in worse shape.

That would make sense if Democratic policies actually helped minorities.

True.

I agree with you that a narrative about men secretly scheming to keep women down would be a false narrative, but that is not what 'patriarchy' means in this context. 

I have a hard time finding the ""serious"" feminists because whenever its revealed that one of them has said something completely off the reservation when it comes to men or gender they're deemed ""not real feminists"" or ""Tumblr feminists"". That no true scotsman fallacy is very popular when it comes to feminism.

>The counterargument would be to say that a libertarian is being unrealistic if they think that they could make people more unselfish than in any current western democracy, therefore they can't realistically think that a libertarian society could succeed, so continuing to advocate for libertarian policies is, in fact, advocating for an almost certainly failed libertarian society which would feature rampant selfishness.

But the intent makes all the difference. If libertarians are truly unable to accept that they cannot make people more unselfish in a Western democracy (and there's no evidence proving that to be a fact) then they're not advocating for a failed libertarian society. I don't know why you continue to insist that a libertarian society without the coercive power of the state would feature ""rampant"" selfishness. I don't see anything to back up those claims.

>Really? Or are people reluctant to pay higher taxes because having more money is better than having less?

I'm sure there are people who are *wholly* immoral and would hold on to every dime they make if they could. However, most reasonable people understand that higher poverty and sickness means higher crime and a more unstable society. If people's taxes were not going to funding Planned Parenthood, the welfare system, etc. and instead you had a charity system that allowed you to find causes you personally feel passionate about, regardless of whether they're tied to a faith organization or not, and donate as much money as you wish, more people would participate.

>To some charities. To the 'sexy' ones. 

Where's the evidence to back up this claim?

>You might get plenty of funding for charities that care for orphaned children, but drug rehab programs or facilities for housing the severely mentally ill are going to be woefully underfunded. It's just how human psychology and advertising (a key part of fundraising) works. An orphaned child is more likely to evoke sympathy than a smelly, unshaven, erratic homeless man. 

First of all, not all homeless people are smelly or erratic. There *are* homeless children and you can use them to promote homeless charities just like they're used to promote orphan charities if people for whatever reason are not sympathizing with homeless people.

There's been a huge, bipartisan recognition that mental illness is a huge issue in the U.S. requiring more attention. I highly doubt people are going to completely ignore the plight of the mentally ill, especially in a society that will have a presumably easier ability to acquire guns.

Also, in a society with reduced central government power and militarization of police, I think people will find out rather quickly that having hordes of homeless people living in the streets is not a fun or safe reality. When poverty becomes an issue of the community you live in rather than the social programs that you fund through taxation, maybe some empathy will kick in and people will start pitching in.",0,0,1443204437,1444724298
