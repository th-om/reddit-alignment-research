First of all, the Pope is not, nor does he claim to be, infallible. Papal infallibility is something that is extremely rarely invoked, and is almost only invoked when it comes to religious doctrine 'coming from God.'

Secondly, many American evangelicals are not Catholic and have many criticisms of Catholicism, most prominently of which is that the Church  'detracts' from a relationship with God. In essence, they believe the Catholic church **has** no authority.

Third, your claim that the Catholic Church 'put the Bible together' is largely inaccurate. The development of the New Testament Canon was a very organic process that spanned a couple hundred years, with different areas and groups adopting different books as part of their canon. It wasn't until the Council of Nicaea in 325 that a definitive canon was beginning to take shape, and the first person to canonize the 'modern' New Testament was the Bishop of Alexandria, who belonged not to the Catholic Church but the Coptic Orthodox Church.

Finally, as hopefully my last few points have emphasized, the Catholic Church is just one of many long-standing Christian churches. There is little reason that an evangelical should follow the teachings of the Pope any more than they would of the Orthodox Council.",22,0,1442846817,1444726154
