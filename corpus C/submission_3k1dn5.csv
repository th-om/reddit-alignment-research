3k1dn5,On Immigration,34,Bananafrosted,"Isnt it completely illogical to mention that the illegal immigrants are criminal? I mean you can say immigrants who are illegal are inherently criminals becuase they broke the law, they dont pay taxes, they brake a number of laws just in order to stay in the country or becuase they have to buy a house. so isn't the high correlation complete bullshit anyway?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3k1dn5/on_immigration/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441675201,1444731762
