This included many Republican politicians like Marco Rubio that opposed military intervention at the time, when it was unpopular, but now conveniently bring it up as a talking point against Obama. Also, Obama does not get nearly enough credit for the diplomatic solution that was negotiated with Russia that eliminated Assad's chemical arsenal. Keep in mind that a few precision airstrikes probably wouldn't have significantly harmed Assad and probably would have just been punitive in nature, while the diplomatic solution actually ended the use of chemical weapons.

Which begs the question of why even make the threat in the first place.

>and did the best with the resources that he had available. 

We'll just disagree on this point.

Obama has projected a timidity and weakness that the world hasn't seen in a U.S. president since Carter, and even Carter wasn't this bad.  The world knows there isn't a threat Obama will make good on, and they take comfort in the fact that his political machine will allow him to excuse away not making good on his promises/threats.  Right now, hardly anyone takes him seriously as a world leader.  

When you don't have an option to take action, you maintain strength by projecting the will of the American People to the world or even indifference.  For example...

""We have witnessed a great tragedy in Syria.  Their leaders made the deplorable decision, a decision we condemn in the strongest possible terms, to use chemical weapons on their own people, a decision that resulted in an estimated 1,400 deaths.  We've been approached by several world leaders as well members of Congress asking what action the U.S. will take.  The answer is likely unsatisfying.  The American people feel America has lost enough blood and treasure intervening in other countries' conflicts and are flatly unwilling to support another such action at this time.  I am their president, and I represent their interests.  We will not be intervening in the case of Syria.  The other nations in that region will have to rely on their own resources to handle the situation however they see fit, but American intervention is not on the table.  We sever our ties with the Syrian regime, and that's as far as we will go.  The Middle East is seeing turmoil in many places, not just Syria, and those nations are going to have to take action to secure their liberties.  America had its Revolutionary War.  We will not fight everyone else's for the next one hundred years.""

This is at least projecting your knowledge of the issue, acknowledging the will of the People and transferring much of the responsibility for the decision to them, and preserves America's image of strength as we don't appear incapable but rather unwilling to act.  Obama appears incapable of backing up his threats, threats he should have never made in the first place.  Image is not important in many areas of life, but on the international political stage, it's all important.  And our president's image he projects for America is on of a floundering, mouthy, little fool.",3,0,1443599574,1444721950

The only thing Obama could have done differently was not ask for congressional approval.  I think he might have done this if it was not obvious that the people were dominantly against it.

This is what Obama said: 

Obama: ""... I have, at this point, not ordered military engagement in the situation. But the point that you made about chemical and biological weapons is critical. That’s an issue that doesn’t just concern Syria; it concerns our close allies in the region, including Israel. It concerns us. We cannot have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people.

We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation. ...""

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2013/sep/05/context-president-obama-syria-red-line/

Assuming the evidence was there for the sake of the argument, the equation did change, and he was able to extract a major concession that removed the threat. 

Even though people interpret it that way it wasn't a 100% guarantee that the U.S. would take military action.  Even if Obama said he would, I would rather have a president, congress and electorate that would change their mind based on the context and alternatives.  ",1,0,1443633952,1444721950

The Supreme Court has held that the United States is not bound by decisions of judicial bodies outside the US. This doesn't really matter, because if the ICJ (for example) issued a ruling and an American party refuses to abide by the ruling, the only place you can go for enforcement of the ruling is the UN Security Council. Where the US is a permanent member. With a veto. In other words, we can opt out of any judgment made in any court of law attempting to exert jurisdiction on a question of international law. 

US courts have also been incredibly inconsistent in their enforcement of international law in most areas except contracts. The standing rule is that ""international law"" is no different than any other federal law. That means there's not a single international agreement we couldn't unilaterally opt out, and do so with zero legal consequences (economic and political consequences are obviously a different matter). 

Bottom line: the United States is subject to international law only to the extent that we choose to be and we reserve the right to withdraw our consent at more or less any time we see fit, even if only for one case.
