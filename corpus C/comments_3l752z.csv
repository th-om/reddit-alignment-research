Direct quote:

> I was just talking to a friend of mine about this: I’ve heard of some college campuses where they don’t want to have a guest speaker who, you know, is too conservative. Or they don’t want to read a book if it has language that is offensive to African-Americans, or somehow sends a demeaning signal towards women. I don’t agree with that, either. I don’t agree that you — when you become students at colleges — have to be coddled and protected from different points of view. Anybody who comes to speak to you and you disagree with, you should have an argument with them. But you shouldn’t silence them by saying, “You can’t come because, you know, my — I’m too sensitive to hear what you have to say.”

I think, though, that this is simply a function of most college students being left-leaning. You won't see many protests by conservative students simply because there aren't as many of them.
