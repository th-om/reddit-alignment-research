3mcazu,What's so bad about a government shutdown?,34,dovetc,"I keep hearing people talk about avoiding a government shutdown (and how the Boehner news will impact the prospect of said shutdown).  Last time we were approaching a shutdown it seemed like democrats were telling us to begin preparing our bodies for the thunderdome because that would be the new law once the government shut down and it didn't seem to actually mean much of anything when it actually occurred.

Also, the term government shutdown seems a bit misplaced considering that literally one guy lost his job during the last one and it seems the only aspect of the government that physically shut down were national parks and white house tours.

Now that we're facing another potential shutdown I am hearing pretty much the same kind of fear from people who i assume just want to take the opportunity to call the republicans irresponsible.

Am I wrong or missing something here?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mcazu/whats_so_bad_about_a_government_shutdown/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443192562,1444723698
