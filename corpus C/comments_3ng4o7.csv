cvnqpvj,1,t3_3ng4o7,epicwinguy101,"Like /u/ClockOfTheLongNow said, your problem is mainly that you aren't really listening to people who give conservatism a fair shake.  Even if you try to read sources in an unbiased way, if you only get sources from the left, you cannot get the full story in the first place, so your assessment is skewed.  

People like Krugman and Chomsky have made much of their recent careers as being political idealogues.  Yes they are smart.  There are equally smart people across the entire spectrum.  

I'm happy to defend some of the actual positions, but I remain skeptical of what good it would do either of us, given statements like ""Being funded by the Koch brothers who are like real life cartoon supervillains?"".  Were you aware that the Koch brothers have a few cancer centers named after them, including [MIT](http://ki.mit.edu/) and [Johns Hopkins](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/kimmel_cancer_center/our_center/facilities/koch/), which are both are really top-notch programs for this kind of cancer research?  Those happened because the Koch brothers gave a fortune to something they believed in.  Were you aware that the [Smithsonian exhibit on the evolution of humans is named after them](http://humanorigins.si.edu/exhibit)?  That happened because they gave a lot of their money to things they believe in.  Were you aware that they are one of the largest contributors to [PBS Nova](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/about/cred.html), a publically broadcasted science education channel (including some programs trying to raise awareness to changes in the Arctic circle as a result of climate change)?  The Kochs literally give tens to hundreds of millions to great causes all the time, often aimed at scientific and educational purposes.  But since one of the causes they believe in is conservatism, and because they give money to that too, they are cast as ""cartoon villains"" by their political detractors.  

If all you read is their detractors and political opponents, then you'd think they were evil too, even if you tried to read these critical posts in as unbiased a way as possible.

If you would like one of the best arguments in favor of the limited government capitalism that Republicans (generally) support, I encourage you to read ""Economics In One Lesson"" by Henry Hazlitt.

[Here is a free pdf of it!](http://fee.org/files/doclib/20121116_economicsinonelesson.pdf)

To your points, in my opinion for almost every argument, it is easier to criticize Republicans and Republican arguments than it is to criticize Democrat arguments. For example, it is really easy to argue:

""We need to help poor people.  So I am in favor of welfare and giving poor people a living wage and making sure that everyone can eat.  My Republican opponent is opposed to welfare.  HE HATES POOR PEOPLE!  Here is a picture of him with a cigar and here is a picture of him on that one time he took a vacation to the Bahamas.  What a hypocritical idiot."" (cue audience laughter)

Then the Republican tries to explain his/her position:  ""How do I hate poor people?  Do you know where the money for welfare comes from?  I pay for it through my taxes! If anything, you should be thanking me.  I believe that the if you subsidize poverty (welfare), you inevitably get more of it because that's what subsidies do. I support policies that lead to job growth and welfare policies linked to education that help people become independent.   Welfare decreases the value of jobs at the lowest levels, which cuts of the bottom rungs of the ladder for people to climb up.   

See?  One argument is easy:  ""Give money to poor people.""  The other argument is more nuanced and difficult:  ""Welfare leads to a marginally differential decrease in the cost of living which leads to dependency and lack of social mobility."" 

I'm a Republican but yes, our party does stuff that I don't agree with.   I guess I'm a Republican for the following reasons (and I'm just typing off the top of my head so don't judge too harshly):

* I believe that the government should be limited.  The government should only exist to defend people's rights and should not engage in social experiments.
*  I believe that charity is more efficient and better at solving problems with society than government intervention.
*  For nearly every government solution to a problem, the market can solve the problem better.  In fact, the most expensive and inefficient aspects of society usually correspond to their degree of government involvement.  Eg:  Healthcare, higher education and student loans, military/defense contractor waste, welfare, etc.
*  I do not believe the government should steal wealth via a monopoly of force from one person to give to another.  Yes we should have roads and schools and a military, but we should not be funding people's livelihoods to the tune of millions of people.
* The national debt is a danger to America, but probably people will not realize this until the next recession hits, and we can't do any stimulus.
*  Too much power in centralized in Washington D.C and it is continuing to grow.  We need to get back to federalism where the states are fifty laboratories of policy experiments (pot legalization for example) rather than one giant policy that is hard to change and can't respect the diversity of the country (No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, etc).

It sounds more nuanced when you word it like that, but what it often comes down to is ""poor people are lazy and entitled and taking advantage of MY TAX DOLLARS."" That's really no more nuanced than ""let's help poor people."" And I think you know this is how the majority of each side views the issue.

It's not just, and it's not supposed to be just. The government is the miner and, guess who's the mine! you are.

>Our data suggest that churches played an important role in providing services to the needy before the rise of the welfare state. Additionally, our estimates confirm that government spendingdid crowd-out some church spending. Relative to the total level of New Deal spending, thiscrowd-out was quite small, amounting to only 3% of total spending. Relative to total churchbenevolent spending, however, the crowd-out was large, amounting to 30% of church benevolentspending, and explaining essentially all of the one-third decline in church benevolent spendingover the 1933–1939 period. These results may have important implications for the optimaldivision of charitable activity between the government and the private sector.

You have to take a lot of what these people say with a hefty grain of salt. As others have pointed out Chomsky is an accomplished linguist, but little more than a partisan hack in anything else. Krugman is a brilliant economist, but his political commentary is base and devoid of substance. The media personalities you listed are satirists who found an incredibly lucrative niche in political humor (young 20-something liberals). If these are the people that you trust for your understanding of US politics, then you will only ever have a caricaturized image of the GOP.

>I'm talking about things like denying climate change

The climate change issue has caused a lot of division within the GOP. Yes, there are some flat out deniers, but a growing majority of Republicans are coming to terms with the fact that the climate is changing and something needs to be done. Their concern is about how we can be environmentally responsible, while also being fiscally responsible. If we embark on a policy path that does little more than shift wealth and production to countries that don't give a shit about the climate, then we haven't accomplished anything. You generally won't hear about this part of the GOP in the media though because the deniers are the loudest faction and the one that gets the overwhelming majority of media scrutiny and attention.

>Trickle down economics

No Republican has ever advocated Trickle-down Economics. That is a negative buzzword used by the Left to stifle conversation. What Republicans do largely advocate is the reduction or elimination of the corporate tax. Economists universally agree that corporate taxes are an inefficient means of taxation because a fundamental aspect of taxation is that tax incidence can only ever fall on people.  Corporations are little more than bank accounts that make payouts to capital holders and employees. When you tax a corporation, you are actually taxing those people indirectly. At the same time, you are increasing the costs of doing business in the US, providing an incentive for businesses to invert their structures and move both operations and taxable profits outside the jurisdiction of the US. This costs the US both jobs and tax revenue.

>more tax breaks for the rich

The GOP generally supports the simplification of our tax system rather than tax breaks for the rich, although the former usually results in the latter. The reason for this is that the current tax code in the US is written by the rich for the rich. While that may seem counter-intuitive at first think about this: In a complex tax system it is far easier for corrupt politicians to hide loopholes for themselves and their closest friends. By simplifying the tax code you eliminate places for politicians to hide such loopholes, thereby eliminating a major avenue for corruption. A drop in overall tax rates usually coincides with loophole eliminations such that tax burdens do not dramatically increase, but this is where there is regrettably room for gamesmanship on both sides of the aisle.

>Trumps recent racist antics

Trump might be at the head of the current primary race, but he also polls as the least favorable primary candidate among GOP voters. Nearly two thirds of Republicans will never vote for him, and of the remaining third his support is starting to shrink. While there is some support of Trump due to support of his racist drivel, it is again representative of a very small but very vocal minority within the GOP.

>Blaming Obama for everything

I won't disagree with you on this point, but it is largely the result of Obama making a convenient scapegoat in electioneering communications that panders to the vocal base and takes pressure off of the more moderate parts of the party.

>want to scrap Obamacare, Medicare, Medicare and the minimum wage

The GOP wants to cut and/or eliminate a lot of federal programs due to their waste. The amount of overhead that goes into a program like medicare means that only a small portion of its budget ever goes towards payments for services. There is a huge glut in the US bureaucracy because there is little to no incentive to be efficient with the budget. If a program doesn't use the entirety of its budget it can expect to see that budget cut the following year. Furthermore promotions within the US bureaucracy are largely made based on who you know rather than how well you perform your job. A common suggestion by the GOP is to replace these systems with privatized systems that are subject to market forces, and therefore forced to be more efficient. Another suggestion that doesn't get nearly as much airtime is to move towards replacing those programs with a Negative Income Tax or some other form of Universal Basic Income. You'll more often see it posed as a NIT for ideological reasons, but such a system would allow for similar overall payouts in welfare, without all of the glut and inefficiency of the current bureaucracy. This also means long term tax savings and less room for political favors and corruption. A NIT would also have the added benefit of better supplementing low level incomes, eliminating the ""Welfare Trap"", and decreasing the need for minimum wages.

>Cutting education programs while Scott Walker gives $500m to build a stadium?

I can't say much about where the cuts eventually go to, but the US does spend more per student [than any other OECD country](https://www.oecd.org/edu/EAG2014-Indicator%20B1%20(eng\).pdf) with the exception of Switzerland. Our educational outcomes are not due to a lack of money spent. The US is behind in education because of how we spend our money on education.

>Being funded by the Koch brothers who are like real life cartoon supervillains?

The Koch brothers receive a lot of flak from the Left, but did you know that they are two of the biggest supporters of prison and legal reform in the US? They have also been two of the biggest individual opponents of the PATRIOT Act and other domestic spying provisions. The brothers are hardcore Libertarians who are attempting to use their influence within the GOP to move it towards being the ""party of small government"" that it claims to be. Now that is not to say that they aren't also self-interested political players who will also seek policies that are beneficial to their business, but that is hardly a trait that is unique to them. Moneyed groups on both sides of the aisle attempt to influence policy in their favor (the Koch's just have more money than most).

>Gun Control

If you aren't an American then I doubt you will understand how deeply ingrained guns are in our culture. Gun ownership was important enough to the founders of the US that it was enshrined in the US Constitution. It is as fundamental a right in the US as the freedom of speech and religion. Gun control advocates seek to limit, or even eliminate that right in the US.

>defunding planned parenthood

If you believe abortion is murder, then you can hardly support an organization that promotes the murder of children and profits from the sale of their body parts. The whole ""Defund Planned Parenthood"" business has largely been a political stunt in an effort to try and further limit access to abortions. The main part of the GOP did back down from this position, much to the ire of the Tea Party.

Huh. I never would've guessed [that Reagan guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics) was a Democrat.

> The GOP generally supports the simplification of our tax system rather than tax breaks for the rich, although the former usually results in the latter.

No, the majority of the GOP [have literally signed a pledge to never raise taxes, ever, for any reason.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Norquist#Taxpayer_Protection_Pledge)

They're opposed to a simplification if it would lead to higher top marginal tax rates. The principle they're standing up for is ""lower taxes for everyone (but mostly for the rich),"" not a simpler tax system.

> The amount of overhead that goes into a program like medicare means that only a small portion of its budget ever goes towards payments for services.

That is absolute and total bullshit. Medicare's administrative overhead is 1.3% of its overall expenses. Medicaid's is 4.6%. Private insurance companies' are typically in the 7-15% range.

American social safety net programs [put 90-99% of their budget toward benefits.](http://www.cbpp.org/research/romneys-charge-that-most-federal-low-income-spending-goes-for-overhead-and-bureaucrats-is) In what world is that ""only a small portion?""

> A common suggestion by the GOP is to replace these systems with privatized systems that are subject to market forces, and therefore forced to be more efficient.

We tried that with Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefits. No government-run program, just a bunch of government-subsidized private insurance programs. Turns out, privatized systems aren't inherently more efficient—Medicare Part D is less cost-effective than the prescription drug benefits from Medicaid or from the VA health care system.

Privatization doesn't improve efficiency. Choice-driven competition caused by active, informed consumers improves efficiency, but so do economies of scale, and the government is very good at economies of scale.

>[The cyclical theory refers to a model used by historian Arthur Schlesinger to attempt to explicate the fluctuations in politics throughout American History. Liberalism and conservatism are rooted in the “national mood” that shows a continuing shift in national involvement between public purpose and private interest. Each of these cycles includes a phase of dominant public interest, a transition phase, and a phase of prevalent private interest.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclical_theory)

America has a very powerful shared mindset that itself has a very repetitive and predictable fluctuation between favoring conservativism for stretched and then shifting to liberalism as a reaction.  These 'leans' have been happening throughout our history and run in roughly 40 year stretches where the shared mindset favors one of the ideologies and then, as that ideology overreaches and gets exposed, the populace shifts too the opposite ideology (slowly, over years) in reaction and begins to favor the other.

If you look for these 'leans' in the last 100 years, they become pretty obvious.  Post WWII we leaned heavily liberal. Unions exploded, government expanded (SS, medicare/medicaid, EPA, FDA, VRA, OSHA), taxes were raised and America was socially progressive (free love, feminism, hippies, communes, etc).  And as always happened, the left overreached, America began to grow tired of their antics and ideology and in the mid 70s began the slow trek back to the right and conservatism.

In the 80s, conservatism took root and became the favored ideology with Reagan and Morning in America.  The next 30 years or so saw that ideology dominate: tax cuts for job creators, greed is good, deregulation, welfare queens, government bad, unions bad, just say no, abstinence only...America was favoring the conservatism as a reaction to all the years of liberalism.

And the cycle continues.  In the 00s , under he stewardship of George Bush, conservatism jumped the shark and began to grate on the nerves of Americans: an exploding deficit while cutting taxes and putting two extremely unpopular wars of choice on that deficit tab while the hands off government nonsense couple with medicare D then a financial meltdown and a shift away from greed is good all portended and shoved America left again.

So somewhere around 2008 we began the slow march back to the progressive side of things and you are seeing that play out slowly with progressivism re-taking root in America.

So this is where the Republicans come in.  They know America is shifting left and that their ideology is losing favor, being debunked and basically grating on thee nerves of Americans.  And with that they become apoplectic and double down on their failed policies and ideology which exacerbates the annoying aspects and further turns America off to the ideology.

Look for the GOP to keep doubling down until they get really desperate.  I would say that losing to a Hillary, a third straight POTUS election would do the trick, and they will eschew their extreme flank, reform their platform and open up their electoral tent (as the Democrats did in the late 80s).

I was a Political Science (and Economics) major and I read several of the famous conservative treatises, and I have read nearly all of the major libertarian treatises and used to lean libertarian myself. Some of them are more interesting and sensible than others, but to varying degrees all of them rely on debunked notions of human psychology, sociology, economics, and on outdated interpretations of history.

For example, modern psychologists and sociologists don't blame impoverished communities for their antisocial behavior, they believe that to a large degree antisocial behavior is borne of the dismal circumstances of living in poverty. As another example, modern economists don't believe that *laissez-faire* competition lead to efficient outcomes, they believe that in most cases there are inherent market biases that are best overcome by government regulation.

First you have to assume that half the country isn’t stupid and evil so you can look at things a bit more logically, try to see if through others eyes, people who have different beliefs and reasons to yours.

First the two main problems, money and the media.
1 Any politician needs an incredible amount of money to become elected,some estimates put fundraising at 70% of a governor's time, add to that how much time he must spend repaying that debt and you are left with how much time they can work for the good of the country.

2 The media focuses just on things that are simple to understand and make you emotional, explaining complex ideas in an even hand way does not draw viewers. Viewers care more about divisive things politicians may have said than policies, they want to be right and have their belief reinforced.

These two things are destroying politics which is why it all looks  like a big joke. However to try to  help you understand why half the country are such morons I’ll explain the core belief of the two sides and show you some examples of how you can use this to interpret current divisive issues.


You have a conservative liberal split in the US which at the core disagrees on a very fundamental question when it comes on how to improve society.
The liberal idea is ‘for a person's potential to be fully reached he needs the help of society’. The conservatives thing is ‘for a person to fully reach their potential they need institutions and a lack of barriers’.  There is no right or wrong to this problem some people can want the best for society and think one way and vice versa.


So let’s take those two simple things and look at some issues and hopefully you might see why people disagree.(these are ideals of course there are people in  both camps who are greedy sociopaths or just want to see society go bad, these are just philosophical arguments)

1 Welfare:
Liberal:  People are not born equal so it is upto society to address the needs of the people who have little most often through no fault of their own, society has enough so it should provide enough for the greater good  of all.
Conservative: If the government provides for too many people it starts to cause imbalances, people generation after generation become reliant on welfare and do not then manage to pass down the skills  that get people out of this situation, they call this a welfare trap. 

2 Taxes:
Liberal: Wealthy people did not earn every penny of their wages they benefit from a stable society provided by schooling young, police, courts, sewerage. So they should pay back into society at a rate they can afford. If we improve the lot of the poorest the whole country benefits and the easiest way to do this is tax and redistribute.
Conservatives: The government is incredibly wasteful, I work 3 days out of 5 for the government and get virtually nothing back due to the high overheads and inevitable corruption.It would be much better if we give to those causes we agree with only to charaties who are doing a good job. 

3 Obama care.
Liberal: Health care is a basic human right should not just be provided to those lucky enough to be well off, what about children of the poor what did they do to deserve to suffer?
This is so important it should not be in the hands of companies who only care about profit.
Conservative: Everything the government does in comparison to the private sector it does badly, I should be able to choose if I want to spend my money on insurance or not, I should also be able to choose a health care provider and let them compete for the best service,after all it is my health. All we are doing is taking a bad system and adding government incompetence.

4 Big business:
Liberal: Companies only care about profits and will put profit above society, look at oil companies and wall street. You need a strong well funded government to counterbalance large companies.
Conservative: The big government role is what corrupts the markets and companies, if it wasn’t for the government being in bed with them bad companies would fail smaller companies could compete, it is the big government that protects these companies with my tax money.


You see it should come down to do you think people should pool more resources into a central pool that takes care of us all but is involved in more things, telling us more what to do.

cvntywl,1,t3_3ng4o7,Tsuruta64,"A couple points on things that you've just said.

The U.S. throws more money at education at any other country. It's not working. At some point, people need to just stop assuming that throwing even more money will somehow fix things and look at what the actual problems are. And some of it is cutting back ( for example, making it easier to fire shitty teachers) and creating a leaner system.

Trump is at best, controversial within the conservative wing of the faction. Some think that he presents a new voice that should be listened to. Others hate him as much as the left. Go read the National Review ( pretty much THE conservative magazine/newspaper in this country) and you'll find a billion articles slamming Trump and his record.

Gun rights advocates have ZERO trust of gun control advocates at this point, and for very good reason. They compromised in the past ( the NRA wrote gun control legislation in the past), and all they got for it was further and further encroachment of gun rights. As far as we're concerned, gun control advocates will never, ever stop until they have total gun control in this country, so why give them an inch when they'll take a mile? Especially since gun control advocates seem to spend all their time advocating measures which will ban long guns which are never used in crime.

The Koch brothers are just a boogeyman, just like the whole thing about ""money in politics."" As I like to observe, if a politician loses a race, which is easier for him to say? That he lost because he ran a shitty campaign and the people overall didn't care for what he advocated....or that he lost because the Evil Billionaires prevented his totally awesome ideas from being heard by the public?

Marx observed in his writings that democrats are completely incapable of accepting that the people might reject their ideals, and thus have to tell themselves that the military/elites are just holding the people back from rising up and accomplishing a revolution. It's just as true today as it was then. ",0,0,1443972931,1444719433
cvo6bff,0,t1_cvntywl,minorsaint,"Your point on gun control is maybe an opportunity for discussion. 

I favor the repeal of the Second Amendment. I didn't used to. The only reason I do now is that the response to calls for even moderate gun control is to hold up the Second Amendment like its a unassailable trump card. The right has become radicalized on this issue and I feel its forced my hand. 

So your expressed view of radicalization is actually precipitating the radicalism you were afraid of. 

At this point I'd favor every democratic president employing a litmus test to every judicial nominee and only appointing those who will overturn Heller, et. al. By hook or by crook, regardless of the tactics employed, I want the Second Amendment gone or at least neutered. If there was room for reasoned, moderate discussion, I wouldn't feel this way and I never did before Sandy Hook (and the disgusting response to it from the NRA and gun lobby). I would prefer compromise. But the right seems to prefer a street fight to a debate. And street fights aren't fair. And I'm not squeamish. I'm also not alone. ",1,0,1443991662,1444719433

cvo7149,0,t1_cvo6bff,Tsuruta64,"The left is the one who made it a street fight. They just add ""moderate"" restriction after moderate restriction after moderate restriction until you have a de facto ban anyways. This is not a new thing, this has explicitly happened, and you see gun control advocates state that their penultimate goal is the banning of all guns, but since they can't do that, they'll just take the long route to it. 

And also I have to admire your honesty in stating that the law can go fuck itself just so long as you get what you want.

And your comment is a perfect example. **No one, no republican, wants to scrap medicare, medicaid, or the minimum wage.** In fact, republicans are the only ones pushing legislation to prevent these programs from becoming insolvent in a decade.

The USA is a having a hard time understanding what assholes we are to the rest of the world. Please bear with us and help us out, because most of us are pretty sick of this expensive war being run for rich people. Thank you for reaching out to us this way.

Here's the deal with Trump:

Trump is the best and loves hospitality, ok? When he was younger and working on his second or third fortune, it was obvious that he thought the world was a pretty harsh place (he's a New Yorker, where they say Fuck You just to get your attention, so sometimes it comes out) and he wanted to show that you didn't have to hurt people to be rich, and that experiences, luxurious, beautiful experiences were the reward of wealth. He was also very honest about himself, and knew if he could do it, anyone could. He makes the best, the TRUMP, Inc. brand, because he wants people to really enjoy what he has to offer, and he is very proud of offering the best. The best thing in the world to Donald Trump was his 757. He lived in, he loved it, as long as he could get back to the plane and into the sky, he was a happy man.

In 2005, Hurricane Katrina strikes, and destroys the mortgage securitization market. Over time, the damage spreads, mainly due to what the rest of the world would call corruption. Its corruption when everyone else does it, right? When i do it, its 'ensuring the stability of the market and preventing martial law' in 2008. Jeb Bush, the presumed establishment frontrunner, was on the board of Lehman Brothers at this time.

Obviously, the republican establishment was swept out in 2008, and every one in America looked forward to Obama's Hope and Change. But America didn't get that. for about 75% of Americans, the collapse never ended, they lost their jobs, their homes, their families, all the while the right wing Tea Party basically shut down government while getting bought out by the banks that caused the collapse, especially Goldman Sachs.

Goldman Sachs has its hands in the pockets of most american politicians, so it uses its influence to avoid prosecution.

In the course of the collapse, many of Trump's casinos failed, especially in the highly corrupt New Jersey (candidate Chris Christie is governor), and he had to trade in his very nice 757 for a smaller plane. They (Goldman Sachs, the bushes, etc.) shrunk his favorite part of being wealthy. But the Donald is resourceful, and he decided to get revenge. So he broke down the important components of a run for president (building organizations, selecting staff, motivating people) on his smash hit show The Apprentice. All in open view. So when Trump announced he was coming, the Republicans freaked out and tried to embarrass him at the first presidential debate and it backfired spectacularly!

See, Trump knew Bush the establishment guy, was weak in the new media environment. He reminded Jeb and Christie that he remembered the collapse and who was responsible, and that note, along with his pure domination of megyn kelly's first, insane question has put Trump far and away over the establishment, and simultaneously sucked all the air out of the bought and paid for TeaParty.

So, yeah, be worried. Trump might not be the man, you might get Bush3, Rubio, or Carly Fiorina, who is running a campaign on tripling the size of the military and bombing the fuck out of every goddamn thing on the planet.

Trump is on top, and no one on the right can beat him. The mindset of republicans is physically territorial, and attacking the king in this context is heresy. If you fail, you are a traitor. And several of his opponents have dropped out because Trump is in charge on a purely school playground level, he has more stuff, is more composed, he is the boss.",-5,0,1443976855,1444719441
