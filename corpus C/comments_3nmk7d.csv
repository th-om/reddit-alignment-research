For the primary, Bernie Sanders expects to win by running an anti-establishment campaign and rallying the liberal activist left who are unhappy with the Obama/Clinton era's moderation. He will do this as an insurgent without party support, as most of the establishment will back Clinton.

In the event that Sanders wins the nomination, the party will ahve to come together and back him. Democratic Congressmen who may have supported Clinton will throw their weight behind Sanders because the alternative is a Republican president.",1,0,1444153933,1444716865

Sanders has had no party involvement, his connections are limited. He has hired a few people with insight into the DNC but it's not even close to the scale Obama had or that Clinton currently has. ",16,0,1444108273,1444716865

cvperpg,0,t1_cvpeg6z,spaceghoti,"This election strategy is definitely a weakness of the Democrats. They're not nearly as interested in local and state elections as Republicans are, and we're seeing the consequences of their narrow focus on national elections.

However, Sanders' primary failing at this point appears to be name recognition. Hillary Clinton has been in the news for one reason or another for the better part of twenty years, so she has a decisive lead. She probably would have taken the 2008 nomination had Obama not played party politics better than she did (directly appealing to delegates and superdelegates). By going after endorsements and appealing to the party more than the voters at this point in the election, I expect Clinton is going to end up the Democratic nominee.

I like Sanders' policies better than Clinton's, which is why I support him. I also support his drive to bring socialism into the spotlight and debunk the assumptions that have been fed into the national consciousness by conservatives. I think his candidacy is a long shot so I'm not going to throw a tantrum if he doesn't succeed, but I approve of the way he's pulling the party back to the left where it belongs.
