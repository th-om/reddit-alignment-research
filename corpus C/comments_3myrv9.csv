A ""victory"" by Assad's forces with Russian support will never come. US airstrikes haven't stopped ISIS, why do you think Russian ones will?

People always say Putin is so clever in foreign policy, but he's currently involved in two quagmires with no real chance of victory or a path forward and his country is in a terrible recession and is economically and diplomatically isolated.

As an (unnamed) source from the Obama administration said to (I think) a NYT reporter about Russia's involvement in Syria: ""they can knock themselves out.""",14,0,1443621336,1444721617

Ignoring that Russia is only conducting airstrikes in support of Assad, currently (which will certainly not turn the tide in his favor), what stops a perpetual Sunni insurgency from happening?

The US surge in Iraq didn't make Al Qaeda in Iraq go away because Sunnis saw that, even after the ""Sunni awakening"" they would not have a seat at the table in the al-Maliki government. 

Russia can support Assad with all the force it wants, but that won't result in a peaceful, stable Syria. It will result in perpetual civil war, draining Russia's resources.",2,0,1443624819,1444721617

cvjeg2y,1,t3_3myrv9,ariverboatgambler,"The efficacy of airstrikes without ground forces is marginal.  Just think about it, the country is already four years into an extreme civil war.  Most of the population centers that aren't Damascus or border the Med have been destroyed.  Continually bombing the same destroyed targets will be as effective as the current US-led coalition airstrikes.  

Perhaps the Russians will place more Special Forces in Syria to help direct their strikes better than the coalition has, and certainly the Russian rules of engagement will be less stringent than those imposed from Washington.  Still, there's only so much that can be done.  For example, during the Vietnam Era there was more gross bomb tonnage dropped on Cambodia than there was dropped across the world during the entirety of World War II.  

Russian involvement still doesn't change the fact that the Syrian Regime forces are critically depleted of manpower from years of casualties and desertions.  The battle has been stalemated for years now, and without significant infusions of manpower I just don't see how that's going to change.  Hezbollah is already largely committed to the fight on behalf of Assad, and the Syrian regime doesn't have any geographically close allies.  I just don't see where the next surge will come from in order to aid the Assad side.  

I think the smart money here is that there will be a perpetual civil war with foreign involvement in Syria a-la Afghanistan from 1979-1996.  Perhaps events could have been better influenced with more forceful US action in 2012, but time is too late now.  It's an unbelievable quagmire and tragedy now.  

*Quick Correction - I misremembered the details of the bombs over Cambodia.  It should have read ""Dropped on North Vietnam than there was dropped on Germany, Italy, and Japan"".  I think the point still stands, though.  The NVA still succeeded.  ",6,0,1443629099,1444721620

This is equivalent to a planeload of bombs being unloaded every eight minutes, 24 hours a day, for nine years –** **nearly seven bombs for every man, woman and child living in Laos.**

cvjoot0,1,t3_3myrv9,arjun10,"Russian military escalation, combined with the likely increase of aid from Iran in the wake of the nuclear deal, makes me think that Assad is going to be strengthening his position and possibly turning the tides of the war.  

Whether he'll ""win"" is a different story, but perhaps likely at this point; it remains to be seen what the anti-Assad bloc, namely Saudi Arabia and Turkey, will do.  Both the KSA and Turkey are mired in their own wars (Turkey is now fighting a resurgent PKK-lead Kurdish insurgency, and Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States are throwing in more troops and bombs into a quagmire in Yemen), so I have my doubts that they will try to sink even more resources into fighting their proxy war in Syria.

I'm mainly holding out for the YPG in Rojava (Northern Syria) to solidify and secure the gains they have made, because they seem above and beyond the most progressive force in the entire Middle East: secular, democratic, and feminist.  Its unclear whether Assad will turn on them if he wins, they've fought on and off but seem to have recently maintained an uneasy truce against Islamist forces.  But then again, the YPG have also recently made uneasy truces with the FSA, so who knows.",1,0,1443643528,1444721624

With the new support they are just barely going to be able to hold on to the little territory they have left - basically just stop the bleeding. All they are doing is securing their seat at the negotiation table once the world decides that this war went on long enough.
