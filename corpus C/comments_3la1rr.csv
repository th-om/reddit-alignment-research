cv4hy5y,1,t3_3la1rr,mcapello,">I understand why republicans want to use this as an excuse to get rid of planned parenthood. I understand, which is not to say, agree. Here's what I don't understand. Why hasn't ANY liberal come out and condemned this practice? 

To the best of my knowledge, because it doesn't actually occur as-presented. It's been a few months since I've read the transcript of that interview, so correct me if I'm wrong here, but they are clearly talking about transportation and processing fees which are rather minuscule parts of the overall PP budget, but which do help to offset the expenses of preserving and transporting tissue.

Basically, the Republicans are making it sound like PP is making a profit off of illegally selling baby parts, when the reality is that PP is legally charging donor recipients (they are technically not ""buyers"") to offset the significant cost of preserving, processing, and safely transporting human tissue.

I'd be interested to hear what the alternative is. Are we going to arbitrarily discard medically and scientifically valuable tissue... just because it sounds bad to ignorant people? That would be a pretty idiotic way of conducting research policy.

Is PP going to be arbitrarily forced to foot the bill for preservation and transportation, without being compensated? They won't and can't do that, and so we're back to square one: valid medical and scientific use for the material isn't happening because of ignorant public opinion meddling in the process.

Should the government have direct oversight of the costs involved in the preservation and transportation of human tissue? Maybe that's not a bad option, but now the *government* is on the hook for an unpopular practice, and they are *even less* insulated from stupidity than Planned Parenthood is. It doesn't seem like it would be very long before the process was halted.

So I'm very curious to know what kind of ""reform"" is ""needed"" here. It seems like the most relevant reform would be educating Christians on what a fetus is, and educating the Fox News audience on how fetal tissue is actually donated. ",24,0,1442479227,1444727694
cv4vjs9,0,t1_cv4hy5y,shekky,"Basically PP is operating a couple of legal (and ethical) gray areas. The law says the fetal tissue cannot be exchanged for ""valuable consideration"", and that ""reasonable costs"" associated with storage, shipping, etc can be obtained- but there's no specification as to what those amounts are. (Naturally, because they would be likely to vary). In these videos it appears that PP execs are looking to negotiate for high amounts, which suggests that they are not just looking at their costs and then providing what those amounts for reimbursement. 

The second issue from these videos is that technically physicians are not allowed to alter an abortion technique ""in a way that increases harm to the patient"", but they discuss the ways in which they are willing to change their techniques in order to keep specific parts of the fetus intact, if certain body parts are desired for orders. Again, a gray area for whether that could ""increase harm"" to the patients. 

In the most recent video, an exec talks about independent partners of PP who ""do very well"" with their reimbursement for fetal tissue. She talks of clinics who are not non-profit and cannot rely on donations for funding. Again, this insinuates that money is being made in addition to simply covering costs.

I would agree that that would be a problem worthy of investigation and reform if found to be true. These procedures should be covered at cost and nothing more. Overbilling in order to run a surplus (still not really a ""profit"") on the transaction would be highly unethical.

cv4otii,1,t3_3la1rr,cjdeist92,"Here's the problem with the way the Republican candidates (and the GOP/conservatives in general) portrayed the ""scandal"": they have portrayed the videos as absolute proof that PP is selling *for profit* fetal tissue, against the will or best interests of the mother, which is simply not the case. And even the videos show that's not actually the case.

Basically here is what is *actually* happening: a woman comes into a PP abortion clinic to receive a *legal* abortion. Now, fetal tissue is highly valuable for medical research (some main examples being Alzheimer and Parkinson's Disease research). So many research clinics ask for any available tissue (now that the ban on stem cell research has been lifted). So PP asks the mother if she is willing to donate the tissue from her aborted fetus, which does require slight changes to the abortion procedure (to maintain the viability of the tissue used). The doctor makes sure that the changes will not endanger the mother, and then if she provides her consent, the tissue is extracted during the procedure (tissue which would otherwise have simply been thrown away as medical waste). From here, PP sends the tissue either directly to a research clinic or to a biomedical firm that then coordinates with clinics. Now, preserving and transporting research tissue of any kind is costly, but it is currently illegal to sell *for profit* human tissue. However, the law does allow tissue providers to charge nominal fees to offset the costs of preservation and transportation of the tissue. **That** is what PP is doing--charging its tissue recipients for the preservation and transportation costs associated with the tissue. PP is **not** making a profit off of this practice, and it is **not** going against the consent or safety of the mother either.

Basically, the videos were trying to catch PP in admitting what anti-choicers claimed PP was doing, but when that didn't work, they worked as hard as they could to spin what the PP officials did admit to--charging for preservation and transportation costs. And again, nothing that PP has been doing is illegal (contrary to the claims conservatives/GOP are making).

So why is the GOP running on this so heavily? Well, a large amount of their constituencies are anti-choice, and have been trying to find ways to restrict/ban abortions since *Roe v. Wade*. PP is the largest national abortion provider (even though abortions only make up ~3% of PP overall revenue and services), so PP has become the face of abortion to many anti-choicers. PP receives a sizeable amount of money from the federal government--though with the restriction that none of that money go directly towards its abortion services. That federal money makes up ~40% of PP's annual budget, and without it PP would struggle to stay afloat. So conservatives/GOP representatives have seized upon these videos and the general misinformation about the situation to push for defunding PP, in the hopes of sinking the whole organization (much like they did with ACORN a few years back). What they miss is that for many low-income women (and in some cases men even), PP is the primary provider of many heath services, including STD testing, OB/GYN services, family planning, sex-ed, breast exams, etc. And tearing down PP will only act as a disservice for millions of low-income individuals. 

**TL;DR:** It's a bullshit smear-campaign hoping to tear down PP even though PP actually hasn't done anything wrong here, beyond a couple of officials maybe being slightly too cavalier about the whole process. But the GOP/conservatives see PP as the face of legalized abortions and hope to tear it down in an effort to push back against legalized abortions following *Row v. Wade*.",4,0,1442499693,1444727694

No one is ""frothing at the mouth"" to shut down women's health clinics. We are talking about removing tax subsidies they receive, not outlawing their clinics.

>Taking away funding would absolutely destroy them. 

Most of their funding comes from private donations, insurance, and social welfare programs (like Medicare and Medicaid). They are not going to simply close all of their clinics because they lost out on a few federal grants. Many states have already stop state grants and it hasn't sent them into a death spiral.

Which is, in effect, shutting many down. It's the same strategy legislators have used to target clinics that provide abortion; create legal and financial situations that are so onerous that the facility can't operate.

PP could continue to operate without a single dollar of taxpayer subsidies directly to their organization, especially considering that they accept the already subsidized insurance plans required by the ACA.  ",1,0,1442563339,1444727694

This is a [popular sentiment](http://www.sba-list.org/suzy-b-blog/top-12-reasons-defund-planned-parenthood-now) among the right. It's often focused on ""abortion clinics"" however these clinics often provide a much wider range of services than just abortion.

>PP could continue to operate without a single dollar of taxpayer subsidies directly to their organization, especially considering that they accept the already subsidized insurance plans required by the ACA. 

They could continue to operate however reduced funding means reduced services for the people who need it the most and there are [serious questions](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planned-parenthood-cuts-womens-healthcare_55f873e3e4b0e333e54b844e) that Planned Parenthood's place in our health system is so interchangeable.",2,0,1442564151,1444727694

The folks in your article make a great number of assumptions regarding the potential lack of service providers, but are you not making that the same assumptions that if the federal government subsidies stop then no other money will flow into the PP organization?

You do realize that the ""poorest"" people are already covered by medicare/medicaid, which PP accepts for payment right? These same people can get the same health services from ANY provider now, and even the ""not poorest but still not wealthy"" who have heavily subsidized plans from the ACA can receive that same treatments (that are now required by law to be covered) from any healthcare provider.

So why should PP get additional tax payer funding when other healthcare providers, who provide the same services, do not? Why are we not subsidizing ALL healthcare providers with taxpayer dollars (aside from their tax exempt status)?",1,0,1442564370,1444727694
