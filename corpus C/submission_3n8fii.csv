3n8fii,Debt Ceiling Crisis - November 5th instead of December 11th,186,The_Hillary_Clinton,"There has been a chorus of individuals that have claimed that in order to have negotiations without either party being held hostage by a shutdown, there must be more than a month to negotiation.   This morning the Administration cut the time to negotiate the debt ceiling and budget to avert a shutdown from December 11 to November 5th (*36 days in, from 70 days to 34 days*).  If you start from this Monday, its exactly *31 days*.   

How does this affect your opinion of potential debt ceiling negotiations and budget negotiations?   

Would you support multiple short term fixes, as Democrats enacted instead of annual budgets during their most recent Congressional leadership?

Should the President actually discuss in good faith the budget with Congress this time, as this administration unilaterally terminated the negotiation period?
