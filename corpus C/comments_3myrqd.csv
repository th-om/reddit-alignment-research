Planned Parenthood Federation of America (and its regional counterparts) is a 501(c)(3) (a non-profit public benefit corporation). Their revenue comes from tax exempt donations, government grants, services fees, etc. They are not allowed to engage in campaigns, but can advocate on issues. 

Planned Parenthood PAC (and its regional counterparts) is a ""Non-Connected Political Action Committee.""  Their revenue is completely from taxable donations.  PACs can act directly in elections, not just on issues.  

Most social welfare organizations (and I use that term loosely) operate under an umbrella with a 501(c)(3), as well as a 501(c)(4) and/or an PAC.  It's way easier to raise money for a (c)(3) because donations aren't taxable, but there's a lot more of a limit as to what you can do with the money.  The gist is that (c)(3)s can only do 'public education on issues,' (c)(4)s can lobby, and PACs can do about anything they want, including intervening in elections.  All the orgs operate under the same 'brand,' and often there is overlap in employees, but the money stays separate.

    The people who financially support the PAC are the same people who financially support Planned Parenthood itself. Planned Parenthood isn't a financially profitable enterprise and it has relied on donations since it was created in Brooklyn by Margaret Sanger in 1921.

People who support birth control have been involved in the public political sphere lobbying (at the Borough, City, State, and National level) ever since the first birth control clinic was opened in 1916 by Fania Mindell, Mrs. (Ethel) Byrne, & Mrs. William (Margaret) Sanger.

Fania Mindell, & Ethel Byrne and her older sister Margaret Sanger were all arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced to 30 Days.

While convicting Mindell, Byrne, and Sanger the Judge also ruled that physicians could legally write a prescription for contraception. 

Yes... you read that right.

Birth Control was so illegal within the last 100 years that it was illegal to give away or sell any birth control, even condoms. It was so illegal that only in 1916 did it become legal for a doctor to WRITE A PRESCRIPTION FOR CONDOMS or pessaries(an i.u.d. of sorts).

>Miss Rose sent me a copy of your letter of December 5th and I note that you doubt it worthwhile to employ a full time Negro physician. It seems to me from my experience where I have been in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, that while the colored Negroes have great respect for white doctors they can get closer to their own members and more or less lay their cards on the table which means their ignorance, superstitions and doubts. They do not do this with the white people and if we can train the Negro doctor at the Clinic he can go among them with enthusiasm and with knowledge, which, I believe, will have far-reaching results among the colored people.

[That is the most intellectually dishonest statistic I've seen trotted out in a long time](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/05/07/_3_percent_of_planned_parenthood_s_services_are_abortion_but_what_about.html). It ranks right up there with the 73 cents or 77 cents bullshit statement that was getting thrown around a few years ago. Please, stop using it in the way that you are. It's dishonest, and you should feel bad for it.

The amount of revenue they receive from abortion is much higher than 3% and the number of women receiving abortions is higher than 3% as well. 

[Source: Moreover, in terms of revenues generated, abortion accounted for at least one-third, probably more, of Planned Parenthood's $345.1 million in clinic income reported for the last fiscal year. A no-frills (local anesthesia that does not hinder cramping), no-complications, first-trimester surgical abortion typically costs about $400. Multiply that by 264,943 and you have $106 million, more than 10 percent of Planned Parenthood's entire revenues from every source last fiscal year.](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/223livny.asp?page=3). It's from about 8 years ago, but I'm sure not much has changed since then in regards to their revenue model.

If government funding stopped tomorrow, would PP continue giving abortions at the exact same rate as now? If the amount of abortions they perform is in no way dependent on their government funding, that would be the case. You'd be hard pressed to convince me that that is true though.

What would be more likely to happen is that without government funding PP would have to divert funds from the abortion services it provides to help fill the gap where the government funds no longer are. Money is fungible, so if PP doesn't have to spend $1 on contraceptives because the government picked up the tab, it gives them an additional $1 to provide abortion services.

Only if you believe abortion is unethical, which many of us do not. In reality, many people don't have reasonable access to the services PP provides, so it is filling a role that is not being adequately filled by other providers.

>It's 3% of procedures if you count all procedures separately (eg checking blood pressure every visit), but the fact that makes up 86% of non-government revenue is very enlightening.

You are welcome to interpret this data however you'd like, but 3% of procedures is a small amount, and PP really does provide a lot of other services (STD testing, birth control, various preventative care for women, etc). I don't know the ins-and-outs of this, but I would guess one reason abortions make up such a large portion of non-government revenue is because (a) they are expensive, and (b) abortions are one of the few services that are not supported by government funding (and thus would naturally represent the majority of non-government revenue). As such, this statistic does not strike me as surprising. The fact that it is being trumpeted by conservative media (I can't find a liberal source reporting on it) should be indicative of it being used as a wedge between the opposing sides.",9,0,1443627033,1444721752
cvjecjb,0,t1_cvjd18b,Vayate,"What I was getting at is that the three percent figure is misleading and it underrepresents the actual percentage of services that are abortion. But again, I don't have objections to most abortions, just the political advocacy and policy positions of PP.

cvjeinn,0,t1_cvjecjb,burritoace,"> the three percent figure is misleading and it underrepresents the actual percentage of services that are abortion

How? You clearly have a predisposition to disbelieve it, but 3% of procedures is a pretty straightforward statistic - do you think they are lying about the number of abortions that are performed? How could it be better represented?",5,0,1443629202,1444721752
cvjew1d,0,t1_cvjeinn,Vayate,"As I mentioned previously, PP does a lot of ""procedures."" They take your blood pressure? That's a procedure. They take your weight? Another procedure. However those procedures are ancillary to whatever they're actually trying to do -- be it some kind of preventative care, or dosing, or abortions. If you're trying to get an accurate representation of what percentage of services are abortions, those ancillary procedures would need to be grouped together as a single data point. 

I don't think they're lying per se, but I think the number is deliberately misleading. They know that it would run counter to their narrative that PP is a ""women's health"" organization if they published more accurate data, and that a political firestorm would follow. That would endanger their revenue streams, and PP is always deeply worried about its checking account.",0,0,1443629737,1444721752

They want the funding shifted from planned parenthood (700 facilities) to the federally approved facilities (13,000). It is a lie that if you get rid of planned parenthood, you are getting rid of women's health services. An absolute and complete lie.

[""If Planned Parenthood tomorrow went away, there's a good number of patients just in my service area that no longer have a doctor or no longer have a place to go for OB/GYN services,"" said Mark DeFrancesco, a physician in Waterbury, Connecticut, who is president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and published an op-ed this month opposing efforts to end Planned Parenthood funding. ""If they start calling my office, it's going to be, 'Well, we could take you but it might be two, three months down the road.' If they call other places, it might be, 'We can't even take you.'""](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planned-parenthood-cuts-womens-healthcare_55f873e3e4b0e333e54b844e)

[If Planned Parenthood can't replace this funding from other sources, some Medicaid beneficiaries wouldn't obtain services at all. The CBO guesses -- it says it doesn't have the data to know for sure -- that between 5% and 25% of Planned Parenthood's 2.6 million clients, or up to 650,000 women, would lose some or all of their access to care.](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-cost-of-defunding-planned-parenthood-20150922-column.html)

[“Somebody says, ‘Oh, we’ll just move $500 million over.’ First of all, most of that is Medicaid, so you can’t just move it over,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor at George Washington University’s School of Public Health and Health Services, which recently released results of a three-year study of community health services and family planning nationwide. She called it “an absurd claim” that other health providers could replace Planned Parenthood, especially in the South and the Midwest. With the Affordable Care Act, Ms. Rosenbaum said, health centers “have been just overwhelmed with patients because of the expansion of insurance coverage.”](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/no-community-health-centers-arent-going-replace-planned-parenthood#sthash.hl8fEAJ2.dpuf)
