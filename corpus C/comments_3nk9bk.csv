cvpgxyu,1,t3_3nk9bk,Burn-Account,"We should both help the mentally ill and work on better gun controls.

Most pro-gun control people don't discount that we have a fucked up mental health system, just that easy access to guns makes that situation all that much worse, and further, that fixing the mental health system to the point that we would feel safe with the current laws would be a task that is likely a long term, cost/resource intensive project that isnt likely to happen any time soon.

Plus, people who are pro gun control are not just worried about mass shootings, we are also worried about other issues related to gun ownership, the flow of weapons from straw buyers into the hands of criminals, and closing loopholes that allow people to buy guns without passing a background check. 

Furthermore, in the end, as callous as it sounds, I would rather a mentally ill man deal with depression and hardships because they cant vent their anger by shooting up a school then them actually owning weapons and using them to kill others. ",1,0,1444086437,1444718552

cvow17k,1,t3_3nk9bk,awa64,"> Mass shootings are always committed by a person who is in a terrible place, mentally. No healthy, satisfied person wants to kill a bunch of people just for the hell of it.

Why do we say ""mental illness"" even when the shooter published a white supremacist manifesto before their killings? Why isn't it just called what it isâ€”right-wing terrorism? Why do people struggling with depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or anxiety deserve to be lumped in with literal mass-murders, when all that serves to do is further stigmatize mental illness, dissuade people from seeking treatment?",2,0,1444053035,1444718552

And that second part is one half of what he was talking about, the lumping of mentally ill with literal mass-murders has been the greatest stimulus and momentum to addressing mental health in the United States, helping all mentally ill.

They don't deserve to be lumped in with mass-murderers, they deserve the help they are finally getting.

Also, why call it right-wing? The same way you believe a mass-murderer shouldn't represent all mentally ill people, a mass-murderer is in no way a representative of either side of politics.",1,0,1444063094,1444718556
cvpa3c1,0,t1_cvp1q3k,Quierochurros,"OP was saying that all mass shootings were committed by mentally ill individuals. /u/awa64 was pointing out that some, like the Charleston shooter, were committed by individuals with a clear racist motivation. I think this raises the question of what constitutes mental illness. Would he have been considered mentally ill had he not shot those people? Should his racist ramblings alone been enough to get him labeled as ill?

I'll agree that all mentally ill people should not be lumped in with mass shooters, certainly no more than all gun owners should.

And anyone spouting hard-core right-wing ideology in his manifesto is going to be labeled right-wing. No one thinks all right-winners want to kill all opposition, but it requires some mental gymnastics not to see that the Charleston shooter was a right-wing extremist.

Probably not, because there are plenty of racists who spout off their bullshit and shun everyone else as ""crazy.""

>Should his racist ramblings alone been enough to get him labeled as ill?

I think his ideas and plans were despicable, and his actions especially more so, yet I don't think we should get into the business of labeling people ill because of ideas.

Then we may find ourselves policing thoughts and that's something I'd rather not have.

However, the police and security agencies we have should have done their jobs and stopped his plans, those people didn't do anything to deserve being killed.

cvowgm6,1,t3_3nk9bk,TitoTheMidget,"Firstly, I should say that literally nobody on the policy-making side of things is talking about ""taking away guns."" A blanket gun ban is not on the table. Even if it were, it would require a Constitutional amendment or a challenge in the SCOTUS that upholds an opinion that the second amendment doesn't apply to private citizens, and there's not the slightest chance of either of those things happening.

>If we take away guns, that will make it more difficult for them to commit mass murders, however it won't change their mood - they'll still feel terrible, just unable to do much about it.

Yeah - and that's fine. These things are not mutually exclusive. We can help people who are struggling with their mental health *and* take measures to increase the safety of gun sales. The types of measures that have been proposed - mandatory licensing including gun safety courses, mandatory background checks even for private sellers, etc. do not significantly burden law-abiding gun owners, and may help reduce gun violence by *at the very least* reducing accidental deaths.

There are millions of people with mental illness in the United States. The vast majority of them will never kill anyone, much less commit a mass shooting. The way we approach this conversation is depressing to me - I feel that it further marginalizes these people when we make it out like any one of them is liable to snap and kill a bunch of people.",1,0,1444053896,1444718556
