What about Islam is it you find to be inherently barbaric? It's only a tiny minority that take the Koran passages about conquest and war against infidels literally, and to say Islam is the only religion with 'barbaric' passages in its scriptures would be disingenuous. The Old Testament has a bunch of disturbing content.   

One must judge a religion on how people actually practice it, as textual literalism doesn't tend to reflect reality in any religion. The Catholic Church today has the same 'tenets' it did during the Crusades and Inquisition, during pogroms and witch burnings. It's the people who make the religion, not the other way around.

The man lived in the sixth century. Men marrying disturbingly young girls was commonplace, not just in the middle east but in Christian Europe, and it lives on all over the place in the most underdeveloped countries around the world. It's fucked up, but not in an Islam-specific way.   
   
> Or the practice of female genital mutilation?   

FGM is primarily found in a band of countries across sub-Saharan Africa, and is not required by Islam. While many of the most-affected nations are majority-Muslim, quite a few are not, and the practice predates Islam in Africa.   
   
Hell,[ people used to do in Europe and the US as well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation#History), to 'treat' promiscuity, masturbation, and homosexuality- even up to the 1960's. Again, fucked up, but not in an Islam-specific way.   
   
> The violence against gays?   
   
The scriptures of Judaism and Christianity are as anti-gay as the Koran. It's not the religion, but how people practice it.   
   
> The antisemitism?   
   
Modern Islamic antisemitism is solidly based in hatred for the nation of Israel. The [Koran actually treats them rather well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_antisemitism) (even clearing them of the charge of killing Jesus), and for most of the past 1500 years Jews lived quite well- even flourished- under Muslim rule, even while Christian Europe shunned them, killed them, and forced them into ghettos.

2.  It is possible to be racist against a group of refugees and use their presumed religion as a smoke screen.  Anti-race prejudice is considered highly suspect in modern American culture.  Anti-religion prejudice, thanks in large part to defamatory tactics used by proselytizing Christians (most distilled example: Chic Tracts), is still somewhat accepted.  That may be what John Oliver was calling someone out for, if he said what you seem to imply he said.

3.  Can I fairly assume that John Oliver didn't say anything about Christians at all, so that part of the title is just sort of a red herring or at best a non-sequitur?  To address it on the merits:  Christianity and Islam do not address race (usually: Identity Christianity is race-based, for instance).  Religion can become attached to disputes that don't originally have much to do with it, either as a mark of difference or a sustaining impetus.  For instance, the Protestant/Catholic dispute in Northern Ireland wasn't originally about religion.  The Orangemen were mostly Scottish and English people who were granted lands and entitlements by the British crown.  The Irish natives resisted and resented this method of control.  The English and Scottish were mostly Protestant, as were the majority of their nations' populace.  The Irish were mostly Catholic.  The original dispute was about British imperial control, not race nor religion.  In fact, it still is, as the Northern Irish Irish generally want to become part of Ireland, and the Northern Irish Orangemen-descended Irish generally want to remain part of Great Britain.

4.  I can't address the last paragraph at all.  No link, so I don't know what he supposedly skipped.

They also want to *seem* like good people by defending themselves from criticism (because they themselves have been criticized by Christians and therefore project a sense of victimhood onto Muslims) while ignoring the glaringly obvious downsides to Muslim culture.

People like John Oliver are paid shills for leftist extremism or are exploiting it (a la Anita Sarkeesian) to make money. They're selling a product to people who put their own twisted sense of victimhood ahead of any facts.

Islam is *not* a race but like a race it comes with a certain culture and attitude. The culture and attitude just so happens to be at complete odds with the values of predominantly Christian nations. There's nothing wrong with being opposed to letting in more refugees. Multiculturalism is a complete failure and bringing in more people with diametrically opposed values to Western countries is not going to help.

Also, it's important to consider what form the respective ""prejudice"" takes. I confess to being prejudiced about Christians, but that doesn't take the form of wanting to do them harm or round them up and send them away or pass laws designed to oppress them.   Prejudice against Muslims often takes these forms, and worse.  It's true we all have prejudice, that's how our brains are designed to work.

John Oliver *always* used anecdotal evidence and not facts to support his views, though he did use facts in some episodes, and is not bad if he were to be treated as a comedian. 

Watch the territories episode. While he does bring in interesting points, ultimately Puerto Rico can't vote because doing so would require a constitutional amendment (unless it becomes a state, which they themselves said no to). And he does not bring up constitutionality at all, which is bad because he is talking about constitutional things. 

It is amazing how everyone realizes this when John Oliver says something that goes against the hive-mind. And yet no one looks at his other episodes as critically because it agrees and why would you critically analyze sometime you agree with?

Of course, what many on reddit fail to understand is that that is the best time to critically analyze something, when it agrees. I would be very suspicious if a politician came out without disagreeing with the republican viewpoint slightly or the democratic viewpoint slightly. It is best to choose a candidate who came to his views not because he simply falls in line but because he has constantly evaluated them through critical analysis.

I wouldn't consider John Oliver's style of argument much different from any other cable network political commentator. It's rare for any commentator to present a completely accurate picture of how things are. **You're just not going to get a high quality opinion from a TV show.**

Oddly enough, I think Rachel Maddow does a decent job of several of her commentary pieces (other times not so much, but I'll focus on the positive for a moment).
