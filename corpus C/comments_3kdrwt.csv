That's not at all clear. First off Davis is a government official. For her to use her government power to impose her religion is Establishment, not Free Exercise. 

Second she has an option: she can quit. I will point out that Conscientious Objector status is given by a statute, not by the Constitution.

There is no constitutional protection. 

Third this brings us to very shaky legal ground. I assert that as a matter of Fundamentalist Christian theology she is wrong. But we don't want the courts getting involved in theological questions. She has to do the licenses no matter what she claims or thinks her theology says. The law has to be *blind* to belief, not making exceptions for it.

The fact that she can quit doesn't give carte blanche to government's power to compel. If KY could pass a law that would require all employees to support the president, but that would obviously run afoul of free speech protections. The fact that they could avoid the compulsion by quitting is irrelevant.

*She* is not *the law*. That the state has created a situation in which she must either be compelled to perform an action to which she holds religious opposition or a valid marriage application must not be approved is not her fault, nor does it diminish her own rights.

Support how? No, you can't compel a *political position*. But in a sense that is already the law. Federal law is the supreme law of the land. All federal employees have to obey the president. (Within legal authority, as long as it does not violate the Constitution, etc. But not ""it is against my religion"" exception.) Similarly all KY government employees do have to support the governor (same sorts of restrictions). 

>but that would obviously run afoul of free speech protections. 

Would it? There are *laws* that protect government employees from such political interference. Before those laws having government employees engage in political support was common. I suspect that absent those laws today the courts would say that government employees can't engage in political speech while they are acting as government employees.

>She is not the law.

She is enforcing and implementing the law. All of her authority and power comes from some underlying law not from herself.

>That the state has created a situation in which she must either be compelled to perform an action to which she holds religious opposition or a valid marriage application must not be approved is not her fault, nor does it diminish her own rights.

And yet again she has no right to use her government power to impose her religion.

No, we're upholding the rights of people to be treated equally under the law.  People enforce beliefs on others constantly.  It's only when you damage another person's rights (once again, these need to be spelled out, and I think they are in the Constitution) that action must be taken against you.

I have a couple ideas to help steer the discussion.  First, a personal right always comes before a reaction to that right.  That is, I have the right to live my life in many ways.  If some of the ways I live my life have second order effects on someone who believes I'm violating their rights, my right to act autonomously and be treated equally should always trump.  Anyone can choose to be offended by any action that I take, but unless those actions result in purposeful physical or emotional harm, I should be free to act as I want under the law.  

Emotional harm becomes the difficult measuring stick.  I could, theoretically get married to a man (I'm a straight man for the record) just to piss someone off.  In that case, my right to be married to whomever I want trumps anyone else's right to be offended.

This gets into really weird territory when we start to think about psychopaths.  What if a psychopath had a desire to murder, and would never be happy until he could murder?  The law that does not allow anyone to murder someone else is, in a sense, harming this person.  That is a belief that is being enforced on someone.

It's a tricky topic, but I think it gets a lot easier when we just look at it from an individual rights perspective.  It doesn't matter if that person (murderer) is harmed (offended, unhappy), because any individual's right to live will trump someone's right to react to that right.",3,0,1441905350,1444730528

The problem is that the only reason she was denying those people equal treatment is because the government compelled her to provide treatment. And that government compulsion arguably conflicted with her First Amendment protection.

(I really probably shouldn't go here.) It's like abortion. It isn't one side believing that murder is OK and the other side believing that women have no bodily autonomy. Both sides are balancing two *conflicting rights* (the right of the fetus to live versus the right of the woman to control her body), but they place more or less emphasis on one versus the other, and so come to different conclusions. (I realize there are other aspects of this debate, but I'm simplifying.)

In the case of Davis, she definitely has a First Amendment right to freedom of religion. And marriage applicants definitely have a right to be married. Turns out those rights t some degree conflict, and so we must evaluate which is more important in this context. You cannot simply say, ""They have a right to be married,"" and ignore her right to religious freedom. You could argue certainly that their right to be married *outweighs* her religious freedom; that's a subtle but important difference.

Harm is a concept in tort law that's usually defined as any kind of injury or detriment. As for what Kim Davis is doing, it's a civil wrong, which is also a defined legal concept and consists in infringement of a right.  ",8,0,1441896682,1444730532

From the same article

>The record in this case suggests that the burden [on Davis] is more slight. As the Court has already pointed out, Davis is simply being asked to signify that couples meet the legal requirements to marry. The State is not asking her to condone same-sex unions on moral or religious grounds, nor is it restricting her from engaging in a variety of religious activities. Davis remains free to practice her Apostolic Christian beliefs. She may continue to attend church twice a week, participate in Bible Study and minister to female inmates at the Rowan County Jail. She is even free to believe that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, as many Americans do. However, her religious convictions cannot excuse her from performing the duties that she took an oath to perform as Rowan County Clerk. The Court therefore concludes that Davis is unlikely to suffer a violation of her free exercise rights under Kentucky Constitution § 5.

And now, they've offered her to simply have someone else issue the licenses and she's claiming that she still can't sign off on them because ""the licenses and certificates are still being issued (in her view) under her ostensible authority, even though Davis has not authorized them.""

cuwom8i,0,t1_cuwmhza,fizolof,"I see some parallels with the death penalty issue here. Conservatives often think something like ""killing is wrong, unless we're killing a killer"". To which leftists sometimes respond ""if we're killing a killer, how are we any better than them? aren't we stooping to their level?""

The problem with the phrase ""intolerance of intolerance is not intolerance"" is that it's a clear contradiction, unless there are different meanings of the word ""intolerance"" involved. We could rephrase it as ""some kinds of intolerance are not intolerance"" which I think is more obviously nonsense, like saying ""some kinds of milk are not milk"". The problem is also that you can't really be intolerant of intolerance, because then you'd have to be intolerant of yourself. So the first and second usages of this word would also have to have different meanings.

So what meanings could those be? Maybe the first meaning of the word is ""intolerance"" in the general sense of the word, ""being against something"", while the second and third usages refer to more specific, ideological meaning of ""being a bad person""? Then the sentence could be rephrased as ""intolerance of being a bad person is not being a bad person"". The problem is, the phrase then loses much of its significance.

Obviously, there needs to be a different basis for a philosophy of tolerance than ""intolerance of intolerance is not intolerance"". Some people have argued that it's okay to discriminate against things that are a choice. For example, when gay-haters collide with gay people, its okay to favor the latter, since homosexuality is not a choice, while gay-hating is. To some extent it's correct - it's easier to get rid of anti-gay hate than it is of homosexuality. But there are a couple of problems with this statement.

First, think about the last time you hated something. Did you choose to feel that way, or did you just respond to your feelings when you said ""I hate it""? Similarly, you could say that people don't choose to hate gays, they simply feel that way. Perhaps this feeling is more malleable than sexual attraction, but I don't think it's as simple as saying ""hating something is a choice, while loving something isn't"".

Second, I've heard a lot of people on reddit say ""it doesn't matter if homosexuality is a choice or not, we should tolerate it because it does not harm anyone"". These two views contradict each other, so you would have to choose one or the other.

Third, I don't think we should tolerate something just because it's not a choice. For example, pedophilia is a sexual preference just like homosexuality, would anyone argue that we should tolerate pedophilia just like homosexuality?

I think the issue is that leftists proclaim themselves to be ""tolerant"", while at the same times being very intolerant of people who think differently than them. The phrase ""intolerance of intolerance is not intolerance"" is just a rationalization, so they can call themselves tolerant while hating other groups. There is a reason why a lot of people find it hypocritical that the supposedly ""tolerant"" people attack people who are not part of their tribe often more viciously than those people attack others.",-1,0,1441889861,1444730544

This presents a problem because it is interpreted (wrongly so, but it still happens) as all people opposing a given gay rights issue are ""haters.""   This isn't the case, though.  But, the more we use such terminology the more people are conditioned to simplify everything down to a ""with us or against us"" viewpoint when it's not that simple.  I know people who don't want to be involved with gay marriage but have and love dearly gay family members.  They aren't ""haters.""  They simply hold a belief that marriage is a sacrament of their religion and that it isn't meant to be used that way.  Me?  I don't have a problem with it, but I understand their reasoning and respect it, and I don't assign any malice to it.

Honestly, I would have more respect for people like Kim Davis if her position was actually about religion. But it's not.

Davis has been issuing marriage liscenses to remarried people for decades, directly disobeying the word of Christ and directly facilitating active adultery, and her ""religious beliefs"" never came into conflict with it. 

So it's not about religion. These people are plain and simple prejudiced against homosexuals and they're using ""religion"" as a BS excuse to get a special permit to be prejudiced.

Being offended on religious grounds is not harm. The United States, let alone the rest of the western world, have continually allowed people to do things that offends religious belief. 

Me offending you by telling you to ""F*ck off,"" is different from you being offended by art or someone's life styles.

Offending is not harming. Being offended is not justification by itself to prevent or deny it. It is true that some things that are offensive are also harmful, like defecating on a bus. The vast majority of offensive acts, images, sounds are not harmful to that same degree. Defecation is harmful because if it is not cleaned up, it will make the immediate area unsanitary, leading to others getting sick. Defecation is both offensive and harmful. Gay marriage is not harmful, it could be offensive to some individuals.

Individuals in society do not agree on everything that is considered offensive. Some are offended by religion, some by porn, some by alcohol. We do not ban these things because they are offensive. 

Some people do react to offensive material in such a way that it could be harmful to them. Those people need help, they need therapy to learn to react more reasonable to offensive material. It is like individuals who are so terrified of spiders that they cannot willing go outside. We do not destroy every spider so they feel safe, we get them help, so they have the tools to react appropriately to seeing spiders. People who are harmed by offensive material because it is offensive needs to learn to react to it reasonably.

Completely false statement #2. A small number of conservatives support that lady. Even ones that don't support gay marriage, don't support a public official not upholding the ruling. Secondly, the democrats have their own wing of anti gay voting block. Largely African American evangelical liberals do not believe in gay marriage.
