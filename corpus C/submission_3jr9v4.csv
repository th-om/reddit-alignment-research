3jr9v4,"When Reagan is brought up to criticize Republicans, it is no different than bringing up FDR to criticize Democrats",64,garfangle,"You often hear how the modern GOP is out of step with what Reagan believed and what he did in office to make to point that Republicans are too extreme politically. You can credibly make the same argument about FDR and the modern Democratic party, but you rarely hear it voiced.

FDR was indifferent at best to minorities and outright hostile to Japanese-Americans. FDR was more concerned about industrial output to get us out of the Great Depression and fight WWII than environmental pollution/carbon issues. Gay rights were nowhere to be found in FDR's platform. FDR was against public sector unions.

While Reagan was no model of conservative consistency, especially with a Democratic Congress opposed to him, FDR was not exactly a modern progressive's progressive even though he had a supermajority in Congress backing him.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3jr9v4/when_reagan_is_brought_up_to_criticize/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441469728,1444732306
