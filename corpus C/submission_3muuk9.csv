3muuk9,Nazism Extreme left- or right-wing movement?,68,JumpToDie,"Hello so my friend and I were talking about politics, and well somehow Nazism was mentioned, and I stated that Nazism was an extreme right-wing movement(most of the time referring how the National Socialist German Workers' Party(NSDAP) in Germany during 1920-1945 operated)

And I will try my best translating Swedish to English here in my qoute of what he said
""If you are going far enough left, you will end up being either Communist or Nazi""

So I was quite confused what he mean't, and when I asked him what he was talking about he just gave a vague explanation, which I diden't quite understand, so I did some research,
So I did, and found this website: https://itsnobody.wordpress.com/2011/08/19/the-nazi-party-a-left-wing-liberal-movement/

Why I see the NSDAP as extreme right

1. They are for an strong, authoritarian state.

2. They were quite the opposite then libertarian, not accepting any other parties or views then there own, any other ethnics or minority groups.

3. The biggest difference between Nazism and Communism are their's view on the free market and Capitalism. 

Can someone understand his view on this right or left when it comes too the NSDAP

So was the NSDAP really a left wing party? 

Disclaimer: 
I'm not considering myself as a Nazi/national socialist.
