cvp2a8r,1,t3_3nlbwx,IUhoosier_KCCO,"i have a fairly consistent ideology when it comes to vices like sex, drugs, and other activities. a black market will always exist for any illegal vice. black markets have a ton of negative consequences, including funding cartels, spreading diseases, and increasing crime. it seems that anytime these vices are deemed illegal, they create more problems than they solve. 

IMO, it makes more sense to legalize these vices and heavily regulate them. when that is done, then researching these areas can will be much easier and much more beneficial. what if we found that sex therapy was helpful for people who were physically and emotionally abused as children? what if we found that small doses of MDMA could help treat or even cure PTSD? researching these areas are nearly impossible when these activities are illegal. 

so, i'm all for slowly introducing legalization with heavy regulations for prostitution and most drugs. but, i think it is just as important to research them (more for drugs than for prostitution).",28,0,1444063945,1444717848

well think about any job. the situation is that an employee does something that makes a job dangerous to perform or a job that is unable to be performed (depending on the specific scenario). it all depends on how it happens. results could vary anywhere from the brothel suing the client to the employee getting fired. it really depends on the situation.

cvq3m7a,0,t1_cvp86p9,antimatter_beam_core,"So I'm looking at your study, and I found this on page 4 of the PDF:

> Our empirical analysis is based on the UNODC [Report on Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns] data.

So how did [the UNODC report](http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/glotip/GLOTIP_2014_full_report.pdf) get it's data?

Well, the 2014 report (which is probably similar in methodology to the 2006 report cited) tells us that it's data comes from

> The statistical information was collected by UNODC in 
two ways: through a short, dedicated questionnaire distributed to Governments and by the collection of official information available in the public domain (national police reports, Ministry of Justice reports, national trafficking in persons reports, et cetera)

So in other words, most of this information is about how many cases of trafficking were *caught* by the police.  The report even acknowledges this:

> These figures represent officially detected offenders and victims... As for any crime, there is a large and unknown ‘dark figure’ of criminal activity that is never officially detected. As such, the figures reported here do not reflect the real extent of trafficking in persons

So the study you cited as evidence that human trafficking increased under legalized prostitution is based on another study that itself says it cannot actually measure human trafficking.

Further, there's an obvious reason why more people would be caught trafficking under legalization.  When prostitution is legal, the victims (and those who accidentally hire them) can go to the authorities without fear of arrest, and are thus  in theory more likely to be willing to do so.  Additionally, if the authorities are licensing and inspecting prostitution businesses, the police would be able to focus their efforts on *unlicensed* prostitution (which would include the bulk of trafficking), rather than all of it.  Thus, they would become more efficient at catching human traffickers.

I'm not claiming the reports you cited are evidence in favor of legalization.  However, they simply aren't remotely strong evidence that legalized prostitution causes an increase in human trafficking. ",1,0,1444141817,1444717876
cvq4p9t,0,t1_cvq3m7a,balorina,"You're entering into logical fallacy zone.

You can provide data to the opposite.

And to your ""logic"", here's what you don't factor in:

cvq57ys,0,t1_cvq4p9t,antimatter_beam_core,"> You can provide data to the opposite.

No.  I don't need to provide data to counter your data if your data is fault.  Which it clearly is, as the actual source for the data on the degree of trafficking says it can't measure the degree of trafficking.

> YOUNG girls traffic'd in from China, Romania, Eastern European and SEA countries likely don't speak German, English, or whatever the local language is. That makes it difficult to even understand where the authorities even are, much less escape their captors and race to the police.

That factor is constant with or without legalization.  I never said that it was *easy* to go to the authorities as a victim, I said that it was easi**er** under legalization.  If 1% of trafficking victims can go to the police before legalization, and 2% can after, then it's still really hard to go the police, but there'd be a big spike in victims going to the police after legalization (which the study you linked would interpret as a spike in trafficking).

> If you can provide contrary evidence, you are free to do so.

Again, I don't need to do so if your evidence is bad (which it is).  I only need to provide counter evidence if you provide some.

>  I can provide more studies proving the reality of the matter

Please do, but you should actually check where they get their data from and try to analyze it yourself first.  Studies often rely on questionable methods, especially in politically contentious fields like this.

cvp2f7c,0,t1_cvp2c1y,RedOctober15,You are a liberal. Of course you are offended by a positive thing for children. Of course you would conflate that with prostituting yourself.,-17,0,1444064154,1444717920
cvp2s3h,0,t1_cvp2f7c,IUhoosier_KCCO,"your response makes absolutely no sense. all i'm saying is that you are not a hypocrite for supporting something, but telling your kid that maybe there are better things out there to do.

thanks for not answering my question.",12,0,1444064686,1444717920

There's plenty of wiggle room between ""this is not a thing I want you to be doing"" and ""this is not a thing I think *anyone should be allowed to do.*""",12,0,1444063798,1444717920

If I had a daughter, at any rate.",5,0,1444064426,1444717923

I would steer my children away from becoming prostitutes, but that doesn't mean it should be illegal for adults to do so. Same as it is currently with pornography.",6,0,1444064559,1444717923
cvpc32p,1,t3_3nlbwx,pjabrony,I'm for it. Something has to drive the price down. It is far too expensive to go on the black market to buy sex.,-2,0,1444078466,1444717928
