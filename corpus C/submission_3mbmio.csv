3mbmio,Did democracy get it wrong?,86,carter1984,"Reading more about how same sex marriage has come to be legal, it appears that virtually ever instance was the result of a court case rather than the ""will of the people"". Vermont was first to allow civil unions, but only did so in response to a state supreme court ruling. Massachusetts followed a few years later, but again it was in response to a state supreme court ruling. In the wake of these cases, 34 states put the decision in the hands of ""the people"" through ballot initiatives to ban same sex marriage in their state constitutions. The measures passed in 31 states, mostly by overwhelming numbers (almost 70% on average). Other states already had bans on place. Only a very few states voted to allow the definition of marriage to change (three I think) to allow ""marriage"" (not ""civil unions"") between people of the same sex.

We live in a democratic republic. Referendums are held every year that ""we, the people,"" get to vote on. So, if a referendum is suppose to determine the will of the people, and we accept that democracy is how we want to govern ourselves, when is it right or wrong to discard public referendums?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mbmio/did_democracy_get_it_wrong/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443179264,1444724022
