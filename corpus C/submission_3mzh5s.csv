3mzh5s,"""I'm sure if the United States made beer, it would cost $50 a six pack"" President Ford 1975",41,elizabeth90125,"While I am an unabashed liberal, it's not hard to see his point. Because the government doesn't need to make a profit, it never worries about how inefficient is. No one cares because it's not their money. Just look at NASA or the Military, they burn through money like nothing I have ever seen. The tallest building in the World took years to build by thousands of men and cost $1.5 billion to build. So what was the military spending $2 billion a week on, in Iraq? I mean, they lost $12 billion in cash that was delivered on pallets, and just vanished with absolutely no accounting of it. That is about 90% of NASA's budget for a year.

The US spends more than the next 15 biggest militaries in the world combined, yet Republicans as saying that if we don't give them more, they just can't protect us. It's insane.
