cuxn3z8,1,t3_3khk0z,sillyhatday,"Liberal, Progressive, Conservative, and Libertarian voting blocks have been swapped routinely over time, but there have been common threads running through the parties over their entire lifespans. When people ask if the Democrats and Republicans have switched since the Civil War era, I usually respond ""yea and no, but mostly yes."" Here are the components that haven't changed. 

The Republicans have always been the party of:

Business and industry. That used to mean deploying ""big"" government to build public infrastructure, promote a national industrial policy, and impose tariffs. Since the end of the gilded age, it has meant shrinking government to ward off the regulatory state and taxes. 

Religion. The republican party has always been the more pious of the two, favoring legal restrictions of personal behavior that conflict with religiously influenced standards of decency.

Price stability. Rich people like hard money. 

Nativism. The Republicans have always been skeptical of immigrant populations.  

The Republican instinct. The Republicans have always favored a little more Republicanism in our Democratic Republic. They want indirect public influence on government rather than direct public control. The worry is that more direct democracy is messy, and majoritarianism isn't necessarily wise. Minorities can suffer and the general public often doesn't understand government well enough to be making decisions. It's better for qualified people to represent public interest, and decide on public policy democratically among themselves. 

The Democrats have always been the party of:

Populism. They favor the everyday man over the elite. This has come in the form of conservative and progressive populism in different time periods, sometimes bridging the two. Even when Democrats promoted laissez faire economics, it wasn't due to any ideological commitment to it. Rather it was an alternative to the corporate and government promoted mercantile capitalism of the 1800s.

Secularism. The Democrats have had religious elements, particularly in the days of the solid south, but they were never in the party's driver's seat. Democratic platforms are devoid of mention of god or religion until fairly recently. Jefferson's secular instinct has always prevailed in the party he grandfathered.

Inflation. The sliverites, bimetalism, greenbackers, paper money, inflation bills, fiat currency, and fractional reserve are all cries of the Democrats throughout history. As national finance evolved each of these were ways of expanding the money supply in the economy of the day. The effort culminated in the 1913 passage of the Federal Reserve act, signed by Democrat Woodrow Wilson. There are a couple of big exceptions here in Andrew Jackson(D) and Abraham Lincoln(R). Jackson was an ideologically incoherent person, focusing lots of attention toward personal vendettas against the banking system, while Lincoln resorted to whatever it took to finance the Union war effort, including printing money with no backing, and shaky legal standing to do so. 

Immigrants. The Democrats have always been more welcoming of immigrant populations. It began with a strategy of using party funds to get immigrants settled and supported financially in exchange for electoral support. Republicans are making a callback to this when they talk about Democrats using social programs to buy votes. There is a minor complication here in that some immigrant communities that had rivalries with others would support the Republicans out of pure factionalism. 

New York State. Martin Van Buren of NY remodeled the Democratic Republican party into the Democratic party. This is often erroneously attributed to Jackson, who was merely a celebrity frontman for the rebooted party. It's initial strength there created the Tammany Hall machine which dominated the state until FDR. By then NY and the Democrats had mutually fallen in love with progressivism, so the Democrats are the stronger party still to this day. 

The Democratic instinct. The Democrats have always favored a government closer to the people with more direct public control. They like more Democracy in out Democratic Republic. The people know what's best for them, and they should have it. The idea is that the government has no legitimate interest apart from the interest of the people. ",4,0,1441949444,1444730324
cuxgp58,1,t3_3khk0z,Braver_Incident,"They flipped when the Democrats decided to abandon the southern vote by passing the Civil Rights act, so the Republicans saw an opportunity to gain significant voters and started appealing to the south.

I really don't see what could be similar about them besides supporting some variant of federalism and a republic.  This was 1 and a half centuries ago, the times are drastically different, and I honestly don't see why we should care what a political party has maintained in the last hundred years.

Commonly asserted but completely false.  the south stayed [solidly democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1990) until the early 90s.  Republican presidential candidates did well in the south, but that's because they did well everywhere.  from 68 to 92, republicans won an average of more than 40 states per presidential election.  The only election they lost, 1976, they did worst in the south.  To the extent there was ever a southern strategy in the 70s, it failed completely.",3,0,1441938420,1444730324
