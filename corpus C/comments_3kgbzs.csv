1. Iowa and New Hampshire are important by virtue of being first, a big part of that is they weed out candidates to narrow down the group for everyone else. The group is small already for Democrats, so they have lost a bit of their importance. 

1. It is only September. Sanders is going have to fight fatigue as it drags on. Many of his supporters are going back to school, so he won't  be drawing in as many crowds and donations. He's going to have to spend wisely. 

1. He hasn't had to campaign against Hillary. If it gets to a point where she feels truly threatened, the attacks are going to start coming.

Vermont and Massachusetts will go to Bernie, but it won't matter. Colorado and Minnesota could conceivably go to Bernie, but I doubt it. 

The truth is outside of the internet and especially Reddit, Bernie isn't a darling that everyone agrees with like people think. Ultimately, Clinton has significantly more money and the establishment support. People keep comparing Sanders to Obama, but it's far from the same.

Part of the reason Iowa & New Hampshire are so important for small candidates is name recognition and fund raising. Winning an early state can give you name recognition and help you in the polls in later states. The real big deal is fund raising though, that's the life blood that keeps the campaign going.

The problem is Clinton has locked up many of the big donors for the Democrats, while Sanders refuses to accept donations from Super PACs. The result is even if Sanders win some of the early states, he's going to have a hard time competing with Hillary on advertisement and paid staff. Hillary will keep collecting money, especially from establishment Democrats and her Super PAC; while Sanders will have to rely on smaller donations.

Even in the most optimistic scenario for Sanders where he wins all the early states, I think Clinton will outspend him, blanket the airwaves with negative ads, and manage to get ahead of him on Super Tuesday. In the more realistic scenario, Clinton will unleash her war chest in January and will probably win one or more of the early states, followed up by an absolute destruction on Super Tuesday.",7,0,1441918552,1444730414

IF Sanders wins Iowa and New Hampshire, he'll get a huge slug of free media.

He'll get a huge bump in fundraising. 

And it starts the David and Goliath narrative. 

The pundits stop saying, ""Bernie can't get the nomination"" and start saying ""CAN Bernie get the nomination?"" They'll all remark about how incredibly rare it is for someone to win both New Hampshire and Iowa and not get the nomination. 

Bernie starts looking very strong. Hilary starts looking incredibly week. People start asking, ""if she can't take on Bernie Sanders, how could she possibly handle Jeb Bush?"" 

Hilary would need to start engaging Sanders and responding to his campaign instead of ignoring him. 

This reshapes the narrative of the entire campaign and he'll start seeing big gains of support across the country.  

Don't get me wrong. Even if Sanders wins both states, he's not getting the nomination. The political establishment is way too strong in this country to allow it.

When Sanders hits NV (latest poll: 55% Clinton - 18% Sanders) and SC (latest poll: 54% Clinton - 9% Sanders) three weeks later and gets absolutely slaughtered, NH and IA won't really mean much. Looking further, Clinton has similarly massive leads in the Super Tuesday states for which semi-recent polling is available. 

So sure, Sanders might get a bump for three weeks, but I seriously doubt it will be enough to significantly change the election. His campaign will come crashing back to earth when he hits the primaries for states that aren't 90% white.
