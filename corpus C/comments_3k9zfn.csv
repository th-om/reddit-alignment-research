Instead, the Supreme Court essentially drafted legislation: they over reached. Now we are going to see more otherwise good people charged and hassled by others for holding firm to religious principles. 

The hoops that people jump through in cases like this continue to be laughable. All that would have had to be done is a recall vote by the county this woman works for. *If* the residents thought she was ill performing she would have been removed from office and replaced. Instead the national media decided to come down on this woman, who received death threats by the way. I particularly enjoy the one from a gay man who said that her daughter should be raped in front of her and then both of them should be beheaded.

It turned into a national news story because of the inherent need from this community to play the victim in all things. 

Moreover, now licenses are going to be issued from this clerk's office illegally. I doubt she will be signing them, making it a violation of Kentucky law. So, if this really is a ""love"" issue (with death threats) and these protesters really do show the true colors of Kentucky (I'm sure 9/10 were bussed in) then just pass a Kentucky or US law legalizing same sex marriage and all the fixings thereof.

I don't think there's an objective right or wrong, but I agree that there is a subjective right and wrong that everyone figures out for themselves. 

But I don't think your analogy holds. If someone was trying to ban mint ice cream (I don't like it either) by passing a law, or having an executive order signed, or amending the constitution, then I don't think you would have a problem with it. You might vote for representatives who don't support that law, but you wouldn't deny the process. Similarly, people wouldn't complain about Kim Davis if she were spearheading a campaign to pass an amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman.

(Aside: I think that people wouldn't complain *only* because there's so small a chance of that happening that it's not worth worrying about. If there were a chance that the amendment would pass, people would be trying to forestall the process by any means, even skirting the law as Davis has.)

But instead, suppose that the person who hates mint ice cream, rather than pass a law, declares, ""Don't bring mint ice cream in my presence. Don't come into my office if you eat mint ice cream. Don't knock on the door of my home if you've ever had mint ice cream. And if I see you being crushed under a pallet of mint ice cream, I'm leaving you there."" 

Now, all of a sudden it's not a theoretical affront to the mint-ice-cream eater based on a long, reasoned, legal process. Now it's just one person with a contrary opinion getting in your face. 

Here's where I, as a third party, someone who neither eats mint ice cream nor can't stand its presence, have to consider. What you, and what most people say, is that because the mint-eater is ""just living their life"" and the mint-hater is interfering with that, therefore the mint-eaters are right and the mint-hater needs to be more tolerant. But I disagree. Because in my opinion, you're allowed to feel the same way about people as you are about ice cream. Valuing people is a personal choice, a subjective right and wrong, just as everything else is. 

So what I'd like to do is give the mint-hater the best chance to have a life bereft of mint. If she wants to form a mint-hating business, a mint-hating community, or even a mint-hating town where bringing mint ice cream in gets you kicked out, then I think that right is more important than making sure that the other people can get their mint ice cream wherever they go.",1,0,1441905423,1444731150

And if I see you being crushed under a pallet of mint ice cream, I'm leaving you there.""

I basically agree with you that people should be free to do not associate with people they disagree with but here is where we differ.
