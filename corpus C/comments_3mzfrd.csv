There's actually a lot of energy, at least on reddit and amongst the younger demographic, for Bernie Sanders (as I'm sure you're aware) and once the debates do start, I think there will be more enthusiasm amongst the democratic party as a whole. Is it good for democracy? I'm not sure it is necessarily either good or bad. Look at the Republican candidates. There are plenty of them, and yet which candidate has the most energetic following? Donald fucking Trump. Is that healthy for democracy? I think the quality of the candidates, the intelligence and awareness of the voters, and the restriction of the money flowing to campaigns are all more important than the quantity of candidates.

Actually, it is.  You might not agree with his platform, but a candidate who isn't a career politician and isn't beholden to donors being this successful is a good thing for our political system.",3,0,1443638075,1444721455

But I do understand and agree with the idea of someone disconnected from the donor/lobby construct to have success. But you also have to look at the candidate that's doing that. Donald Trump isn't representative of the ideal ""grassroots"" candidate free from the aforementioned donor/lobby system. He isn't relevant for his record of public service, or ideals, he's relevant because he has millions of dollars(I'm unsure of his net worth) earned through casino real estate; a flash in the pan industry.

 opinion.

cvjqq9n,0,t1_cvjq2ug,usernameistaken5,"Certainly not much, but wasnt that the rights biggest arguement against him as the Democratic nominee? He also had the distinct advatage of not saying things that were demonstrably false about foreign governments, immigrants, or making brash nonsense claims about how he would use his tone to get foriegn leaders to submit to his will. Furethermore, Obama at least had legislative experience.

Basically the largest difference is that Obama, while not having much experience, did not say and do things that would lead you to the conclusion that he had no idea what he is talking about (and I dont mean this in a partisan way aka I disagree with his assesment. I mean it in a basic facts are not fungible kind of way). Trump has continually demonstrated that not only lacks experience, he lacks a basic understanding of what is actually going on. Two examples:

1) that the Mexican government is intentionally sending criminals across the border. His source: Hes been to the boarder and talked to some people there.

Al Gore was pegged, more or less, as the incumbent. 

This cycle Hilary has all of the advantages of incumbency, all of the name recognition and institutional support. And so challengers are having a hard time getting in the game. 

It certainly happens whenever an incumbent president is running for re-election. There is rarely a serious primary election in such a case. 

Is it good for democracy? No. Not at all. But there are benefits for a political party in not spending lots of money on a primary and in making their selected candidate look inevitable and strong. ",3,0,1443633246,1444721458

The debate is within the party, in the media, between voters, etc. Politicians debating each other in the media is just pageantry and never really touches on the details of issues. 

Chris Christie and Rand Paul shouting at each other for 20 seconds on TV is not what actual political debate in the country looks like, that's the result of debate going on elsewhere coming to a representational head. 

If you're a democrat and you have spent more than ten minutes reading about the election, you've been exposed to the debate. If you've talked with other democrats about it, you've likely talked about Sanders vs. Clinton. ",8,0,1443651588,1444721458

What do you mean? They're both giving public speeches constantly. 

That aside, they are well-known politicians with published platforms and voting records and statements on a wide range of issues. Lack of information about the candidates is certainly not an issue.
