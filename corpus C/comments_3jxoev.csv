cut6bzi,1,t3_3jxoev,looklistencreate,">In 2008 Barack Obama sprung to national attention, bringing a message of hope and equality. Republicans blocked him at every turn.

As the opposition always does. Note how President Bush got most of his landmark legislation passed when the GOP had a Congressional majority.

>preach xenophobia

I'd hardly call it xenophobic to suggest that all illegal immigrants be deported, no matter how unworkable that is or how many problems that would cause. Most of them don't even propose letting in fewer legal immigrants. And then of course there are Republicans like Rubio and Bush who favor a path to legal status for illegal immigrants.

> divisiveness

Your words, not theirs. Everyone always campaigns on unity.

>and want to rollback everything Obama enacted

Yeah, not like the Democrats, who continually promise to repeal the Bush tax cuts and Reagan-era drug laws.

>Btw, how is the news not latching on to ""shipping millions out of the country"" sounding like some other party back in the 1930s and 40s?

Deportation of some number of illegal immigrants is the only alternative to open borders, which does not have majority support and never has.

>Republicans blocked him at every turn.

That's... that's what opposition parties try to do. What would you expect them to do? They think what Obama is doing is wrong and are trying to stop it.

>want to rollback everything Obama enacted.

Once again, what do you expect people that think he's wrong to do?

>The republicans have even polished off the ""unamerican"" catchphrase (dixie chicks anyone? Communist witchunts of a bygone era) to brand anyone with differing views, heritage and ethnicity in an effort to smother differing views.

This is actually getting close to a fair point. The Republican party does have some problems with being insular and unwelcoming. You're going a bit far though, we aren't seeing people being blackballed or arrested for their political views.

> Btw, how is the news not latching on to ""shipping millions out of the country"" sounding like some other party back in the 1930s and 40s? Didnt eveyone go to war over that? It is so sad society doesn't remember history or worse, doesn't vilify political maneuvers that reek of tactics meant to divide and encite the crazies.

I assume you mean the Nazis (NSDAP). The Nazis didn't kick anybody out, they put them into camps and worked them to death. And no, that's not what people went to war over. People in 1940s Europe couldn't have given less of a shit about Jews (or Slavs/homosexuals/several other groups that ended up in the camps). The Nazis are one of the reasons it's unfashionable to be anti-semetic today. People went to war because the German army invaded them or an ally (or an ally of Germany attacked them, as was the case for the US).

If you do want to draw uncomfortable parallels for ""shipping millions out of the country"", I'd suggest the Trail of Tears as something better to latch onto. 

As for being divisive, you really can't be more divisive than comparing someone to the Nazis.

> but you have to agree Trump getting elected is a step backward in social, womens and just about any other advance in the last 30 years...

Since 1985? Is that really the period you want to hold up as progress?

Actually, except for what happened this year (gay marriage legalization), I'm having a hard time coming up with an advancement in society that was really a public endeavor. The ADA I suppose, but that's quite a gap. Most of the change in the past 30 years has been private change. The government didn't legislate society be more accepting of people (at least not since 1985). We did that on our own.

Government R&D in tech has produced some pretty good things, but I don't see anyone arguing too much against that. 

I may have my own problems with the republican party, but your post just seems unfocused and unspecific. I'm not sure what point you're trying to get across.",1,0,1441626639,1444731996
