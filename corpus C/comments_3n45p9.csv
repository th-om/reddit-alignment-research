Anyone who talks about unemployment as a consequence of free trade doesn't understand free trade. Free trade is totally and unabashedly about income.

Don't believe me, believe the guy who won the nobel prize in trade theory:

>Why don’t economists subscribe to what sounds like common sense to businesspeople? The idea that free trade means more global jobs seems obvious: More trade means more exports and therefore more export-related jobs. But there is a problem with that argument. Because one country’s exports are another country’s imports, every dollar of export sales is, as a matter of sheer mathematical necessity, matched by a dollar of spending shifted from some country’s domestic goods to imports. Unless there is some reason to think that free trade will increase total world spending—which is not a necessary outcome—overall world demand will not change.

>Moreover, beyond this indisputable point of arithmetic lies the question of what limits the overall number of jobs available. Is it simply a matter of insufficient demand for goods? Surely not, except in the very short run. It is, after all, easy to increase demand. The Federal Reserve can print as much money as it likes, and it has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to create an economic boom when it wants to. Why, then, doesn’t the Fed try to keep the economy booming all the time? Because it believes, with good reason, that if it were to do so—if it were to create too many jobs—the result would be unacceptable and accelerating inflation. **In other words, the constraint on the number of jobs in the United States is not the U.S. economy’s ability to generate demand, from exports or any other source, but the level of unemployment that the Fed thinks the economy needs in order to keep inflation under control.**


>That is not an abstract point. During 1994, the Fed raised interest rates seven times and made no secret of the fact that it was doing so to cool off an economic boom that it feared would create too many jobs, overheat the economy, and lead to inflation. Consider what that implies for the effect of trade on employment. Suppose that the U.S. economy were to experience an export surge. Suppose, for example, that the United States agreed to drop its objections to slave labor if China agreed to buy $200 billion worth of U.S. goods. What would the Fed do? It would offset the expansionary effect of the exports by raising interest rates; thus any increase in export-related jobs would be more or less matched by a loss of jobs in interest-rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as construction. Conversely, the Fed would surely respond to an import surge by lowering interest rates, so the direct loss of jobs to import competition would be roughly matched by an increased number of jobs elsewhere.

cvkpyo0,0,t1_cvknat2,iliveintexas,"Manufacturing jobs used to be the backbone of the middle class. You could get a decent paying job without front-loading 4-years of intensive education. Now, if you want to be apart of the middle class, you have to go to college, and even that's not a guarantee for a good job.

That's why people are obsessed with bringing manufacturing back: to regain the lost middle class jobs. I'm not suggesting that it's the best strategy, but this is the motivation for the issue.",4,0,1443721265,1444721020
cvkshgd,1,t3_3n45p9,Jenocular,"Nobody is bringing back manufacturing jobs.  I just don't see why you would want to do that.

If anyone wants to bring more jobs to America then they have to make the US competitive.  I obviously can't speak on behalf of all sectors but I can tell you first hand that while job hunting for both me and my SO the US isn't very competitive.  What I kept seeing over and over again was that the salaries were almost identical to positions in countries such as Germany but that the American job offer pretty much no benefits.  So why would anyone who works overseas go and work in the United States?  They wouldn't.  You have to create jobs here that people actually want.

The future for the United States is innovation.  We have to create new jobs and stop trying to bring back old manufacturing jobs to the US.  It makes more sense for someone who was making $1 a day to make $500 a month overseas than it does for a US worker to make $29,000 a year.  It's a global economy.  What we need to do is create specialized jobs for US workers that don't rely on cheap and uneducated labor.  On top of that we really need to reform our system to provide benefits.

Think about what you need to work in the US.  First you have your salary, minus all your taxes, subtract health insurance premiums plus additional healthcare costs, daycare, and transportation costs.  Now compare that to living in a place that provides very low cost or free healthcare and daycare plus good transportation networks to get you to work cheap.  Add pension plans, 5-8 weeks of vacation, more paid holidays, more sick pay, paid time off to be with your young children in some places over a year, better hours, cheap or free education, job security through unionized labor, etc.  We're simply not competitive.

Our system is built on the belief that a high salary is everything.  It's not.  Expenses make a big difference, benefits, and time off.  You're caught in a weird spot otherwise.  Companies will move their jobs overseas to take advantage of cheap labor if that's all the job entails or qualified professionals working innovative jobs in the US will move overseas to more competitive positions.",2,0,1443724945,1444721020

No, it will GIVE to tax payers.  Who do you think will be rebuilding our infrastructure? China.  No US companies will be hired, they'll pay their employees who will then spend money in our economy.  AND we'll have better infrastructure. It's a win, win and win. Spending money on infrastructure is the BEST use of taxpayer dollars.
