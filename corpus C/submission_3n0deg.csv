3n0deg,In defense of cutting Planned Parenthood.,37,ragmondead,"Hello all, 
 In recent weeks I have seen vicious posts about how the Republicans are trying to destroy Planned Parenthood and how evil they are and the great work that Planned Parenthood does. I am going to try to give a defense for why Planned Parenthood should be cut, without discussing the morality of abortion.


1. Planned Parenthood is a charity: People donate money to PP (Planned Parenthood) because they support the work PP does. PP in exchange gives away free services funded by the donations. 

2. Governments collect income mainly through taxes.

3. Governments use tax money to support PP: If governments major form of income is taxes, then it stands to reason that the vast majority of funding given to PP by the government is tax revenue.

4. People should be free to choose where they donate their money: This is probably the point of contention in the debate as I guess this is more a moral argument than a factual one. But if a person wants to donate $100 to a charity, they should be free to choose what charity they wish to donate the money to. 

5. The government is forcing people to donate to PP: by collecting taxes and using tax revenue to support PP the government is forcing people to donate to PP. 

6. PP supports abortion: while it is true that abortion is only one of many things PP does, it is a pretty well established fact that PP supports abortion.

7. many people do not support abortion.

conclusion. 
By using tax money to fund planned parenthood the US government is forcing people, who do not necessarily agree with abortion, to donate to a charity that goes against their person beliefs.
