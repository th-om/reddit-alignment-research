3namqk,"Can the U.S switch sides on Israel, and become very close to Iran or Egypt?",56,themooster32,"Is it possible, that the United States could slowly drop Israel as our ally in the Middle East, continue working scientifically with them but become a lot more friendly with the Arab countries? I rather be on good relations with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iran than Israel. I feel as though the benefit is minuscule, despite the technological advances made while working with the Israelis. If we could become some sort of friend with the Sunnis and Shiites, without becoming one's ally, we could solidify our power in the Middle East in a greater way, and possible even improve relations between Shiites and Sunnis. 

Or even if we just allied close with Saudi Arabia, Iran or Egypt. We would have a *much* stronger ally in a very important region! The U.S public would be against it of course, but the populace could begin warming up to the other country(ies) and our cultures could flourish along with improved views of Arabs by Americans. Honestly, I never understood why we can not just bury the shovel with Iran, if we came out and said ""let's be friends"" and snuff Israel. Also, Israel often snubs the U.S along with *rumors* of Israeli forces interfering with the U.S",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3namqk/can_the_us_switch_sides_on_israel_and_become_very/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443834391,1444720049
