Bill Gates. He's literally the richest man on the planet, and a pretty liberal atheist.  But I think he'd be very pragmatic decision maker.  I'd vote for him. 

And he's alive. ",1,0,1443029422,1444725120
cvble1j,0,t1_cvbka98,bumbleshirts,"Less charismatic though, isn't he? I mean, pretending Jobs is still in the picture. I'm sure he's more charismatic than a dead man.

And the atheist thing, I don't think that helps much in terms of electability. Not that being Buddhist is much better, but it's gotta rank higher than 'Atheist'. 

I'd definitely vote for him too, though. ",1,0,1443030979,1444725120

Literally the only time I've been inside a temple was for friends' bar/bat mitzvah services. Nothing is uniquely Jewish about my upbringing or culture. That's what drove my smarmy response to the comment about Jobs being ""culturally Muslim.""

AFAIK ""cultural Islam"" was basically just a turn of phrase that central Asian republics in the USSR used so they could hold on to Muslim traditions while being nominally secular communist states.",1,0,1443034712,1444725120

He wasn't muslim at all lol. He was born in Syria. That doesn't make him muslim.
