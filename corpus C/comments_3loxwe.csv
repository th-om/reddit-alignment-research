I like Bernie a lot, I've been very critical in the past because his fans are the worst.  His climate policies are the best out of anyone running.  He's done a good job of keeping important issues in the  spot light (financial and racial inequality) though he could be doing a better job with racism (but Hilary is doing a terrible job with it).

I would be inclined to vote for him if I felt confident that some of his wonkier economic policies would get beaten down in congress.",9,0,1442770043,1444726342

The reason she's not talking about it right now is because she's playing the long game and sticking to less controversial issues. I know a lot of swing voters seem to be kind of sick of BLM because for the most part it they've made themselves look bad while supporting a cause that doesn't effect a majority of voters. 

Not saying I don't think race issues are important, I'm just saying they're not going to resonate with those that are going to get out and vote for her",1,0,1442772110,1444726342

However racism is one of the largest problems this country has, I'd say largest if not for global warming.  But from her rhetoric I'm not too hopeful that she'll do much.

Also I don't like the hate on BLM, I think they're being very effective with their mission.  Speeches, rallies, civil disobedience, protests are all great.  And it's important to push your allies along with your enemies or else you'll keep on being sidelined.",7,0,1442773738,1444726342

cv860d0,1,t3_3loxwe,awa64,"I'm on the fence. If the primary was today, I'm not sure which of the two I'd vote for, and here's why.

I feel like a lot of people believe the office of the Presidency has more power than it does.

If I'm voting for a symbol of where I want this country to go? Bernie Sanders would be that choice. I want universal health care. I want a financial transaction tax to discourage high-frequency trading, and see the money raised being used to end our dead-weight student loan system as a perk. He's addressing race and gender issues head-on, and you can tell it's from a place of genuine belief and passion rather than because they're hot-button issues. Sanders is calling for changes that I want to see, and it's remarkably refreshing to have that happening for once.

But look at what the President's job actually is.

* Foreign Policy: Pretty much absolute power, short of signing treaties (which the Senate can override) or declaring war (which Congress has to do, but the President has had increasingly wide power to ignore the need for a declaration for decades now).
* Legislative Agenda: Only actual power is a veto. Beyond that, the only power the President has is the weight their name carries and their ability to wrangle members of their political party in Congress.
* Judicial Agenda: They get to appoint judges. Most importantly, they get to appoint supreme court judges to lifetime terms... so long as they can get them approved by the Senate.
* Executive Agenda: They choose who runs the various federal agencies (if they can get them approved by the Senate) and how those agencies are run, although the Legislature still has control of the budget for those agencies.

Clinton's not perfect when it comes to foreign policy—she did vote in favor of the Iraq war, after all—but she has a lot more experience with it than Sanders does. She's a career politician (and actually a Democrat as opposed to merely caucusing with the Democrats in the Congress for 20 years), so I'd expect her to be more effective at actually influencing Congress from the White House. I don't expect her choices for appointments would be that much different from Sanders', either, at least not after coming to a compromise that could pass Senate confirmation.

TL;DR: I agree more with Sanders ideologically but I think Clinton would be better at the actual job.",7,0,1442776586,1444726342

>The data on the impact of an FTT on volatility are mixed, some studies show a positive effect and some show a negative effect. However, it's clear that FTTs do reduce liquidity, and that is a far bigger problem than many realize. The 2008 financial crisis was in many ways the mother of all liquidity crises (AIG had their sec-lending collateral in high yield debt! It's a big part of the reason it went under). Liquidity is something we tend not to appreciate until it's gone. As for the net welfare effects of an FTT, that's also not clear either as there is far too much we don't know about asset reallocation.",1,0,1442855270,1444726342
cv83i2v,1,t3_3loxwe,kevinbaconjames,"I actually really like Bernie. 

I think he is a good person, he is principled, and has a fantastic track record. If I lived in Vermont I would happily vote for him as Senator. However, I think he is much better suited for a role in the legislative branch, because being President requires so much compromise and he has not really ever shown a willingness to do that.

Bernie seems like a great guy, but part of me really wants to see him get crushed just because his supporters are so annoying.",6,0,1442772886,1444726342

cv8j25d,1,t3_3loxwe,Captainobvvious,"I guess I support Clinton...

I like Sanders. I think he really believes in what he says. He definitely doesn't focus on the richest. My problem with him aside from the fact that his supporters are (at least the ones I have encountered on Reddit) insufferable... Is that he has decades of experience with no major legislative accomplishments borne from the fact that he is absolutely unwilling or unable to compromise. Not a quality we need in a president. 

You can't be effective playing only to the leftmost of the party. ",5,0,1442797320,1444726342
cv80u2r,1,t3_3loxwe,Nonsanguinity,"Bernie supporter here.

IMO Clinton is the embodiment of the phrase ""by trying to change the system from within, the system ultimately changes you.""  I believe her and Bill were very idealistic in their younger years, and I think that their idealism was well-founded on principles of justice and equality.  I don't think she has totally abandoned those principles, it's just that our current political system requires that she whip and nene on Ellen for votes, and rub shoulders with Wall Street PEGs and so that's what she's going to do.  

I also completely admire her ability to have weathered 25+ years of the Republican Hate Machine and still remain standing.  I think it really got to Jon Stewart just being on the periphery of the political game for 15 years - for her to be able to withstand being in the middle of it for so long is nothing short of miraculous. Their current goal of trying to get the ""untrustworthy"" mantle to stick is the result of none of their previous efforts being able to take her down - it certainly wasn't their Plan A.",3,0,1442768917,1444726342
