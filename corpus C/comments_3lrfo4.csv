It doesn't make her qualified but it explains why she's popular, which was your original point. Name recognition and being the first and only democratic nominee for a little while goes a long way. ",16,0,1442807636,1444726198

It's a nice primer on what she's done.

IMO, her biggest weaknesses are her personality (which really is flat), her ties to big money, and her hawkishness. She's pretty good on social issues for me (a progressive), and while she's maybe a bit to the right of me on a lot of things, issues-wise I don't dislike her. I don't see anything that would keep her from being a good president. I'd rather a Bernie Sanders presidency, mind you, but I'd take Hillary over anyone the Republicans are running this time around.

cv8z8ol,1,t3_3lrfo4,HeyZeusCreaseToast,"A lot of times, a politician isn't necessarily ranked on what they have done, but what they represent - when it comes to representing a large and varying body of people, it's less about what you have *done* in the past and more about what you will *do* in the future. Presidential candidates are more often a reflection of the mood in the country and the direction the voters want to take the country - it's a feeling rather than a specific policy or legislative item.

My Mom, my Grandma, and my sister are all big Hillary supporters - and I think for a lot of women, Hillary represents where their generation is (my Mom), what the past generation of women fought to get (my Grandma), and someone who the current generation (my sister) can look up to.

Hillary is the embodiment of what a Third Wave Feminist is - a mother who has their own career while simultaneously supporting her husband and family. While President Clinton was in the White House, Hillary was consistently attacked for her looks, rather than her intelligence. She was one of the most active First Ladies since Eleanor Roosevelt - spearheading legislative healthcare reform when traditionally First Ladies picked ""fluffy"" pet projects such as beautifying the county (Ladybird Johnson) or getting kids off drugs (Nancy Reagan). Hillary has also given numerous speeches about feminism and supporting women's rights in developing countries - going to places and seeing things first hand.

When President Clinton's infidelity with Monica Lewinsky came to light, Hillary stood next to him and supported him. There's an interesting scene in a Sopranos episode where the wives of the mobsters are sitting around talking about this and praise Hillary for being a strong woman and swallowing her pride and putting her husband and family (and country) above herself.

Again, for a lot of women and other minority groups, Hillary is seen as a fighter - a fellow minority that had to fight tooth and nail to get where she is. She wasn't born into status (not that she was born into poverty either). She has been in the public spotlight since her twenties (she was involved with the Watergate hearings), First Lady to a Governor, First Lady to a President, US Senator, Presidential Candidate (now twice over), and Secretary of State. People (specifically women) look up to her.

My Grandma (WWII Generation) sees in Hillary the history and struggle of women's equality.
My Mom (Baby Boomers) sees herself in Hillary and the same struggles she had to go through.
My sister (Millennials/Gen X-ers) see our Mom in Hillary and all the things she has done to better our lives.

I'm not the biggest Hillary supporter, but I can see how her life story appeals to large swaths of the American people.",10,0,1442842799,1444726205

She laid the groundwork for a lot of the developments within international diplomacy that are taking place today. She was very important in getting the sanctions on Iran in place - without those, the deal would have never come into existence. She also supported the killing of Bin Laden (not a straightforward position at the time - Biden opposed it, for instance). She led the way on the New START treaty, and whatever else you can say about the Russian-American relations post-Clinton, that treaty still stands. Finally, I think the (slow) Burmese shift towards democracy would not have occurred without Clinton's lead.

Overall, she didn't bring about any extreme change, but she also hasn't done nothing. The relationships she's forged with world leaders would certainly help her as POTUS. ",5,0,1442829017,1444726205

The GOP is losing the culture wars, as they find themselves increasingly on the wrong side of history. 

That leaves foreign policy, and with their most likely rival the former SoS, it only makes sense to focus heavily on the perceived failures of the ""Obama/Clinton foreign policy"". Thawing/normalizing relations with countries like Russia (the 'Reset') Burma, Cuba, Iran, and Venezuela (soon) that the previous administration might as well have considered a second tier on the axis of evil while pulling back from Iraq and Afghanistan and failing to commit to Libya and Syria are all easy to spin as 'weak' and 'compromising'. They have to keep pounding on all of those decisions as terrible, and when something inevitably goes awry, they can score points. The Iran deal is inherently risky - it's far less dangerous to oppose it than it is to support it. This is why it was so hard to even convince Democrats to get on board.

She served on the boards of several non-profit organizations and large corporations, including as the first female board member of Wal-Mart, and was the primary breadwinner for the Clinton family. She also continued working on behalf of families, co-founding Arkansas Advocates for Children & Families in 1977, and on political campaigns, serving as Jimmy Carter's Indiana director of field operations in 1976.""
