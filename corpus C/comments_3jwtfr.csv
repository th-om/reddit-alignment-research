The public won the fight for more transparency fifty years ago, which is why your city animal control officer can't have a lunch meeting with the comptroller without having the entire conversation archived for eternity by half a dozen entities.

Hell, my salary and employment status are public record, available on the internet, because my employer has some researchers on staff who receive grant money.  The government does transparency *really* well.
