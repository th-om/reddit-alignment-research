Let's start over again, if you will.

>Is there no line though where government does have a responsibility to step in?

Yes, I do agree that there should be a point that the goverment should step in, I do not agree with how they should in all cases.

>With guns for instance, should I be able to buy an RPG?

As I said before, I am fine with people owning any weapon so long as it does not bridge the gap that useage of said weapon would cause destruction to other people and their property. If you for instance, wanted a nuclear bomb, I would be OK with that so long as you had a place that you could safely set it off if you were to use it, as well as clean up the mess it makes. I would not be OK with someone keeping that in their 1 bedroom apartment, but that does get into the extreme of extremes.

For instance, I own a demilled 81mm mortar, I would get it fixed, and fire pratice rounds from it if I had a place I could safely shoot it, and because its not a weapon that causes mass harm (The area of a mortar round exploding is not that big really, 15 - 30 feet depending on how the shrapnel flies, that is easily contained in a safe area, assuming you can find HE rounds for sale), I would have no problem with someone keeping it in their house. Of course I would have a problem with it being used in a neighborhood unless the person using it has enough land to fire it safely, but you get what I mean.

>With healthcare, should a private hospital be able to let me die on the sidewalk because I can't pay?

This is a tricky one. On one hand, I don't believe that people deserve other peoples labors and such for free. On the other hand, of course I don't want people dieing for no reason on the street. I think our current system is not that bad over all, while improvements definitely need to be made, it works.

>I know it can be frustrating to deal with questions that seem so far out there, but if government was not involved in those two industries, are not both of those scenarios inevitabilities?

I don't believe so. If the goverment did not restrict arms at all, there really would not be a huge difference. As of right now, criminals can get whatever weapons they want, they just cost more. The only people that can't get whatever they want are the people who follow the government's rules. If we look at france, they have very restrictive gun control, however 2 terrorists where able to get a few fully automatic AKs and a live RPG with ammo for somthing like 5 grand. Figure in america, for a legal, full auto AK47 it would cost just shy of 20 grand, the RPG would cost around 2 and live ammo is generally unavailable, just training rounds. 

For healthcare, if the goverment was not involved, then it would be a million times cheaper, but possibly a bit less reliable. There would be so many less restrictions and so much less money spent on certifications, schooling and FDA testing, that healthcare products that currently would leave someone to die in the street, would be affordable even to the poorer of our communities. Charity may even be able to bridge the gap for the healthcare of the ultra poor as it would cost so much less, however quality of care would differ greatly between hospitals and clinics and that could be a net negative over our current system.",2,0,1443648214,1444721989

The thing about school shootings and larger weapons like automatics and explosives that I will retort with is this - It is stupid easy to make and deploy a basic bomb, and semi auto weapons are actually better over all for combat by using trained, aimed and slower fire than just spraying an entire magazine into a wall in 2 seconds (900 rounds per min vs 30 round magazine = very few hits and a lot of bullets in the wall. I have not fired a full auto gun, just bump fired a few semi autos I own, but I have been told that auto control is much harder than people make it out to be without extensive training.)

That said, I am not against the NFA system as a whole, I just believe that the 86 MG registry ban should be repealed, and SBRs / suppressors should also not be part of the NFA. This still has extensive background checks and requirements for owning a automatic or DD legally, however a simple weapon like a mac 11 which costs $500 to make is no longer only available on the market for 5 grand and is 50 years old.

Honestly, I was playing more deviles advocate with my responce to healthcare. I believe that if we actually used insurance as insurance is meant to be used, IE not paying for everything but just catastrophic things and ER visits, while mandating that hospitals show pricing to people before they 'buy' their product would lower health costs in this country. I am not for deregulation for the reasons you stated (It would be horror at first, but in the end it -could- possibly be better, but it also could be much worse).

I like this example better. I would like to state that I am not for a federal increase.

Let me pick your thoughts apart below, then its your turn for mine-

>My understanding of economics is without any minwage we would end up with people paid in vouchers and slide into a ""company town"" scenario with places like Walmart.

I don't belive that we would, unless unenployment got so bad that the company vouchers were a net positive to the people who worked there.

Employees work on a supply and demand basis, much like any other product. If Walmart wants to buy peoples labor, they will have to pay what people accept. Currently, that is minimum wage often, and that is because there are far more people that want to sell their labor than shops that want to buy it. If there was no minimum wage, the price that walmart would have to pay for labor would be the lowest price people accept for their labor, if that ends up being company tickets, than the person who accepts that as pay have decided that these company tickets are worth their time. There are far too few businesses that can really run that model, even if people where A-OK with it, in my opinion as people need food to eat, and most places do not sell the type of food someone who is poor would eat. I don't think enough people would be motivated in today's market, absent of a min wage, to work at a place like walmart for a company ticket even. My problem with a *FEDERAL* (Trying to stress this) minimum wage is as follows, What works for seattle, may not work for bumbfuck town X in missisipy, and because it works in one place does not mean it may or may not ruin another. 

I do believe that states should be, and should be encouraged to set their own minimum wage for their own economy.

>I believe that greed is guaranteed and as such exploitation will occur wherever someone feels they can get away with it.

I also believe this, but greed is a 2 way street. I myself am greedy enough that I would not take a job below $10 an hour at this point in my life unless I really had to, all while the businesses are greedy that they want to pay as little as possible, yet they still need labor so that 'as little as possible' really comes down to 'the least amount people will accept'. There is also the genuine problem, especially with a high min wage like $15 an hour, that an employee could make less value for the employer than their wage if it is mandated that high, thus forcing them out of the work place because they don't have the skills to make it worth an employers time to hire and train them.

>Thanks for the serious responses, it got my wheels turning and I genuinely enjoy the mental exercise.

Thanks as well, I enjoy legitimate discussion and like to try and expand my mind's view, so the more I can understand of other sides, the more I can evaluate my own belief system... not to say I don't have my biases that may or may not move (Don't get into an argument with me about guns =P) but I do like to try and expand my thought processes.",2,0,1443650662,1444721989
cvj94qd,0,t1_cvj50c3,jtniggle,"I definitely don't want to eliminate government to the point where they can't maintain law and order. I think that to have a high functioning society, the people need to have faith in the system that the bad actors among will be dutifully punished for their deeds. Do you have faith in that system now? 

I know that I don't have that faith, and I believe that this needs to be addressed.

Regarding firearms, I think our society is far too interested in demonizing the objects right now. People want to blame the gun, but you don't see these people trying to blame box knives, or planes, or fertilizer, or diesel fuel. Instead, people that use those things to harm us are to blame and are considered terrorists. But for some reason, when someone shoots people, they want to spread the responsibility out to the objects. 

In my opinion, violence is a social issue that will only be fixed when we hold the individuals responsible for their actions and push family values back into our society. 

Regarding health care, I'm less informed, but I think we need to look at how bring down the cost of health care, so that insurance costs can come down as well. All I see hospitals doing right now is maximizing their billing to bleed the insurance company for all it's worth. Of course this is going to force them to raise premiums.

There are two parts of the argument which changes things drastically: the first 20 weeks where the ""baby"" is no different from any other part of your body and after 20 weeks where it is now a form of a baby. 

The first part, where its no different from a body cell, is pretty easy. That stage has no more right to live then a egg from a womans ovary or a mans sperm. 

The second part gets difficult because it comes to moral and opinionated argument. The woman or the baby? Pragmatically, it should be the woman because she would able to have more baby to replace it and there is a lot of time invested in her life already unlike a baby. ",1,0,1443562438,1444722016

Ok

>would you say that an abortion infringes on the baby's right to live?

That all depends on when you consider it to be alive. I believe that the current legal standards of abortion do end the 'life' of the baby before it is 'alive'. We could talk about what exactly is 'alive' as well, Just because a collection of cells making up a large organism, is it truly alive? is it sentient? does it matter if it is a sentient being or if its just alive? One could argue that a baby is not truly alive and sentient until a year or so after it is born as it really won't remember anything nor does it have any real thoughts until after a year old making it just a small animal with no real mental capacity, but I doubt we would find many that say an 'abortion' would be ok up until then.

So to really cut to your question, I don't believe that a baby is alive until about the 2ed trimester going into the 3rd.

On the flip side, does the baby have the right to the mother's health and wealth if the mother does not want the baby? Things get a bit tricky when you look at it that way as well.",7,0,1443560956,1444722020

They can be different, sure.

Actually, that is *exactly* what the first amendment states must be done if ""2 lovers"" go into a catholic church, get their religious marriage, and then use that marriage for the civil marriage as well. But the ceremony - that is the important part.

What you are confused by is the fact that the church you go to defines ""2 lovers"" as a man and woman... and the church those other people go to defines ""2 lovers"" as 2 adults who can make their own choices.

Well shit. Everybody gotta get paid.

>Return the completed license within ten days of the wedding. **The marriage officiant has only ten days after the wedding ceremony to return the completed license to the county recorder where you purchased the license**

So let me get this straight - the marriage *depends* on the officiant, who in religious weddings is you know... religious... to confirm to the state that the wedding ceremony was performed? And they can use a religious ceremony?

Now - I know that can be a non-religious ceremony too... but that isn't what we are talking about. We are talking about the state taking the religious ceremony performed by a religious servant and using that to issue the wedding licence. And because that is done in Christian and Catholic and Jewish and Muslim places of worship - all that usually only marry men to women - It must also be done in any non-denominational church that has also performed a religious marriage for their patrons.

That is true. It is also unrelated to this topic.

If that same couple, within the alloted time, goes to the state house - they use the religious wedding ceremony, and their pastor signs off on it. The inextricable link to religion is simply because the religious ceremony can be used. If everyone needed to have a second civil ceremony - then your argument would make sense.

Incorrect. A license is obtained PRIOR to having a ceremony. The license means that the couple meets the legal requirements to be married in the eyes of the law. Following a ceremony, the state issues a marriage CERTIFICATE, meaning the marriage has been solemnized.

cvjsml2,0,t1_cvjrcz2,Odnyc,"The procedure is fairly similar in all states, but I'll talk about New York, specifically, since that is what I've dealt with on a professional basis. To be legally married in New York, a couple must obtain a marriage license. This document is, for lack of a better word, ""permission"" from the state to have a legally binding ceremony of their choice; basically, permission to get married. They must do so within 60 days. The couple may then have a ceremony at city hall, or religiously. The couple, after the ceremony returns the completed license, with the details of the ceremony, to the office that issued the license. The clerk then issues a marriage certificate, which certifies that a legally valid ceremony took place. In order for a civilly valid (and possibly also religiously) valid ceremony to take place, a license must have been already issued. **In other words, before obtaining the right to have a legally valid marriage ceremony, the couple must meet the legal pre-requisites for marriage** of the State of New York.

**In flowchart form:
License->Ceremony->Certificate of marriage**.

Now, in order to first get that license, a couple must prove they meet the legal requirements for marriage in the state. They must be over 18, they must be unmarried (ie. divorced or a bachelor/ette) and, prior to 2011, they had to be of different genders. Couples who cannot satisfy these conditions would be unable to obtain a marriage license-or permission to have a legally valid ceremony. Prior to 2011, same sex couples could not obtain a marriage license in the state of New York.**No couple can have a legally binding ceremony unless they have first obtained a license to marry.** 

A gay couple who had a religious marriage ceremony before the legalization of same-sex marriage, in the eyes of the law, would be in the same position as any other couple who did NOT obtain a marriage license PRIOR to the ceremony-Not legally married.
Thus, a gay couple getting married in a church would be in the same situation as say, two 17 year olds who got married in a catholic church - married in the eyes of their religion, but NOT in the eyes of the law, because they did not meet the requirements to obtain a license.  

The reason this did not violate the first amendment is this: Both before and after the legalization of same sex marriages, everyone permitted to perform marriages in New York, whether they be priests, rabbis, imams, judges, etc. had the same right to sign a marriage license certifying that a ceremony took place. The difference is, prior to same sex marriage being legalized, gay couples could not obtain a marriage license. Thus, there was no license for the officiant to sign.

Because this is the main point here, and very related to the ability to obtain it.

You write:

Huh. So it sounds like we agree a little here... the religious ceremony is what is being confirmed. But you don't see how that is involved with gaining the licence for that ceremony? You think that the two are not related?

Right. In the case of those who have had a religious ceremony, they are certifying that religious ceremony - right?

Yes, and your bold flow chart was just as helpful. See - if you can't get the licence and that is the reason you can't get the government to recognize your religious marriage in an equal way as it recognizes other religious marriages... your 1st amendment rights are still being infringed upon by the law. It doesn't matter if the entire process has 3 steps or 103 steps... all the steps are required for your religious marriage to be recognized, and if one of those steps is preventing it - then it is a law ""prohibiting the free exercise thereof"".

This isn't like trying to read something that isn't there into the constitution... I'm not trying to say your emails or texts or internet is covered... It word for word applies to religious freedom and to those gay couples who want their religious marriage to be recognized as society recognizes other religious marriages.

It is also a bit silly to say ""Because it is against the law"" as the reasoning. It wasn't against the law to have separate water fountains until it was argued.

I certainly do see your point - the flow chart shows it nicely - but I disagree with your firm conclusion that step 1 is unrelated to steps 2 and 3 and if you get stopped there your religious freedoms are unaffected.

>It would be a violation of the first amendment for the state to say: only rabbis can sign marriage licenses, or; ceremonies from X denomination are invalid"" That was not the case here. The state did not say ""X denomination ceremonies are invalid"" It said: In order for ANY ceremony to be valid, the couple must meet the legal requirements to be eligible to marry.""

They created legal requirements to have a wedding recognized by the state that were specifically denying any homosexual religious ceremony from being eligible for that licence. That is *exactly* the state saying ""only ceremonies from X,Y,and Z denominations are valid - and others are invalid from step 1!""

I certainly understand the specificity in your flowchart, and your experience. I really do appreciate your sharing it. But I am still perplexed as to why you think that the entire flow chart doesn't effect a religious ceremony and you only focus on step 1 and list it as unrelated.

If there is no way to have the state recognize your religious marriage the same way it recognizes other religious marriages - then Step 1 is the law or portion of the law that is effecting your 1st amendment right.

I appreciate the effort in explaining how it works there. I didn't know states had a wait period. Thank you. But your idea that a person's ability to obtain a marriage licence has nothing to do with a religious marriage or that couple's ability to freely express their religious marriage is still a mystery to me. You present it as a ""Gotcha"" moment - but really you didn't.

That inability for a religious couple to obtain the same marriage licence that a different religious couple obtains is certainly an added step - I agree.

cvjwf48,0,t1_cvjultc,Odnyc,"I understand what you are trying to say, but it doesn't constitutes a violation of the first amendment. Government says: Everyone who wants to get married must meet these requirements. The fact that they then allow a religious ceremony to be a civil ceremony isn't germane to these requirements. 

By your logic, if a church wants to marry two twelve year olds, and the state doesn't recognise it,  isn't that the same violation of the first amendment that you're discussing here?

In the hypothetical the state would say ""regardless of denomination or lack thereof, all ceremonies involving minors are not legally valid, beacuse they don't meet the requirements that the spouses be over 18."" 
In real life, prior to passage of SSM, the state would say ""regardless of denomination all same sex marriages are invalid because they don't meet the legal requirement that the spouses be of opposite genders.""

It's not a matter of favoring one religion over the other, its a matter of the law requires X to be eligible for marriage, you must meet X, before you can be legally married. 

Edit: The thing is, despite the ceremony being permitted to be one and the same, religious and legal marriage are two distinct things. To be married legally, one must simply meet the requirements to legally enter into a state of marriage. Marrying religiously merely means that one is married in the eyes of God. The State permits religious ceremonies to be used in lieu of civil ceremonies for convenience. It extends this courtesy to all denominations on an equal basis, (hence not establishing any particular religion.) That equal basis is: anyone who meets the legal requirements to be married may, for their convenience, use a religious ceremony as a stand in for a civil one. 
Additionally, it does not prohibit the free exercise of religion, because nothing in the law prohibits ANYONE, from having a non-governmental marriage ceremony. Hell, a church could marry 3 people to each other, but it only has religious significance. What it does, is establish the legal (or eligibility) requirements for marriage in the eyes of the law, a clear and distinct thing from being married in the eyes of one's religion. In the U.S. states are permitted to determine eligibility requirements for marriage, as per the 10th amendment. (on a non-discriminatory and equal basis-14th amendment)

In order to infringe upon one's first amendment rights, the state would have to either prohibit same sex couples from having a religious ceremony (as in actually stop the ceremony from occurring by law/force) or by refusing to recognize a marriage that otherwise meets the legal requirements simply because it was performed religiously (while continuing to accept other denomination's ceremonies)",2,0,1443655503,1444722068

Of course it does. It's actually the same reason that a literacy test for voting is illegal. Same basic ""trick"". But the fact is, it isn't really a trick. If you set a number of requirements, all must treat the religious freedoms of those citizens equally.

>By your logic, if a church wants to marry two twelve year olds, and the state doesn't recognise it, isn't that the same violation of the first amendment that you're discussing here?

Not in any way. Your example is an example of illegal behavior. It is illegal for an adult to marry a minor without parents permission - you should know this since you worked there - and that permission I think can only be given as young as 16 or 17.

My example is not of illegal behavior. it is not illegal for 2 willing adults to enter into a contract. The only thing keeping it illegal is the law that is breaking their 1st amendment right to have their religious wedding recognized in the same way the state recognizes other religious weddings.

Same applies to the ""What if you want to marry a dog"" or ""What if you want human sacrafice"". Beastiality is illegal in and of itself, as is murder.

>It's not a matter of favoring one religion over the other, its a matter of the law requires X to be eligible for marriage, you must meet X, before you can be legally married.

I agree with you on that second point very much. But you are wrong on the first point. Very wrong. And the reason why the law is unconstitutional is because it does that first part.

>Edit: The thing is, despite the ceremony being permitted to be one and the same

I'm glad we finally agreed on this part.

>The State permits religious ceremonies to be used in lieu of civil ceremonies for convenience.

and it is this convenience which requires the equal treatment of all religious marriages per the 1st amendment.

Like I said all along - if everyone had to have 2 ceremonies, then my argument would not work. It is the very fact that a heterosexual couple *can* choose to use their religious wedding that forces the state to allow the same rights for all religious weddings.

>It extends this courtesy to all denominations on an equal basis, (hence not establishing any particular religion.)

Again, this just was not true. Very specific churches, ones that married men to men and women to women, were not being treated as equals to the catholic church up the road that only married men to women or women to men...

Not sure why you wont admit that part.

>Additionally, it does not prohibit the free exercise of religion, because nothing in the law prohibits ANYONE, from having a non-governmental marriage ceremony.

It prohibits them from freely exercising their right to have their religious marriage recognized in the same way the state recognizes other religious marriages.

It doesn't only say ""The government can not create a religion"" - although I agree that is the first and a very important part of the 1st amendment... but it also says very clearly ""Congress shall make no law ... prohibiting the free exercise thereof"".

>Hell, a church could marry 3 people to each other

That will be the next step in legality, for sure. And why not? People enter into 3 way contracts in business all the time. If 3 people want to marry each other, and there is no coercion involved... why not?

Marriage is not subject to the general laws of contracts, but rather Domestic Relations Law. According to that, same sex marriage was not legal. As illegal as two minors getting married

>>Same applies to the ""What if you want to marry a dog"" or ""What if you want human sacrafice"". Beastiality is illegal in and of itself, as is murder.

>>and it is this convenience which requires the equal treatment of all religious marriages per the 1st amendment.

>Yes, they must be treated equally. And they have always been. They receive equal treatment as follows: an ordained individual may legally marry anyone who meets the LEGAL qualifications for marriage. Until recently those legal qualifications required the couple to be heterosexual. Anyone who has a religious ceremony without meeting the legal requirements to enter into marriage is not considered legally married. This is the same for a gay couple, a minor couple, or a couple who had a religious ceremony before obtaining a marriage license. All of those ceremonies would be invalidated for the same legal reason: They don't meet the legal requirements for marriage. Where or how the ceremony is performed is irrelevant, because ALL couples must meet the same standard. 

>>Like I said all along - if everyone had to have 2 ceremonies, then my argument would not work. It is the very fact that a heterosexual couple *can* choose to use their religious wedding that forces the state to allow the same rights for all religious weddings.

>They allow the same rights. If you are legally permitted to marry, then any religion may solemnize your ceremony. If you don't meet the qualifications to marry, then NO religion can legally marry you.

>>Again, this just was not true. Very specific churches, ones that married men to men and women to women, were not being treated as equals to the catholic church up the road that only married men to women or women to men...

They were being treated equally. They could both marry any couple that met the state-defined requirements for marriage. Gay couples did not meet these requirements, just as two minors would not meet these requirements. In the eyes of the law, its the same thing. 

>>It prohibits them from freely exercising their right to have their religious marriage recognized in the same way the state recognizes other religious marriages.

The state DOESN'T recognize all religious marriages. It recognises the ones where the couples are legally eligible to be married. 

>>It doesn't only say ""The government can not create a religion"" - although I agree that is the first and a very important part of the 1st amendment... but it also says very clearly ""Congress shall make no law ... prohibiting the free exercise thereof"".

It's not infringing on free exercise, because these ceremonies could always occur, allowing the religious exercise. They would not be legally recognised, not due to religious discrimination, but because they did not meet the standards required to be legally entitled to enter into the married state. For example, a catholic church,by canon law, could marry someone who is currently married to someone else, as long as that ceremony did not take place in the Catholic Church. However, that ceremony, while religiously valid, would not be civilly valid because the person does not meet the LEGAL requirements for marriage, being unmarried. 

>>Hell, a church could marry 3 people to each other

>>That will be the next step in legality, for sure. And why not? People enter into 3 way contracts in business all the time. If 3 people want to marry each other, and there is no coercion involved... why not?

Wish I had. I don't mean this is a flippant way, but if your argument had any legal merit, it would have been used in court in the Obergfell case. The fact that is wasn't should tell you that you're wrong. 

The fact is, legal and religious marriages are 100% separate things. The basic law for civil marriages is: you must meet the legally proscribed requirements for marriage. Period. 

Who performs the ceremony is irrelevant, because marriage, legally, is not religious at all. Period. It is merely a legal state. The law recognises NO religious definition of marriage. It recognises the LAW'S definition of marriage.

No. As you pointed out over and over, there was nothing stopping them from having a religious marriage. It was not illegal. The only thing illegal was the law preventing them from having the state treat their religious wedding like it treats others.

>Not to imply that same sex relationships are just like that, but gay marriage was ALSO not permitted by law.

No it wasn't. It wasn't recognized by the state. No one was arrested for performing a gay marriage or participating in one.

Yes it does recognize religious marriages. It doesn't need to recognize them all, and the ones it forbids are illegal for reasons other than marriage. It does need to allow for all of them to be treated equally.

Again, this is fairly silly logic. Most times the lawyer goes for the ""sure thing""... that is true... but again, this is similar to saying ""Slavery has been legal for 150 years, the fact that the judge and lawyes say it is should tell you you are wrong.""

What it tells me more is that religious marriage wasn't at all important to the people suing.

Of course it is... as you said ""it is this convenience"" of allowing a couple to use the religious ceremony which requires the equal treatment of all religious marriages per the 1st amendment.

It doesn't need to do that when it prohibits the free exercise of. Again, you are only focused on the first part of the sentence and not the remainder of the sentence - which are essentially 2 different thoughts.
