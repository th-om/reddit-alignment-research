3l6otf,In what ways can a living wage be instituted without incurring extreme wage push inflation?,146,The_Red_Hood,"I am very confused as to how this should be instituted. I do believe that people should meet certain quality of life standards which could possibly be accomplished with a living wage. However, I feel that the desire for corporate profits will increase the cost of goods and lead us to the same situation we are now where $15/hour is no longer a living wage. In the meantime I don't see middle class jobs seeing being offered similar wage increases which I think could cause the middle class to diminish even further in the future. I am curious as to what other people think. ",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l6otf/in_what_ways_can_a_living_wage_be_instituted/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442419242,1444727844
