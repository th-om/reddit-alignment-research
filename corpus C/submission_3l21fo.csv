3l21fo,"How did ""Percentage of total taxes paid,"" an irrelevant number, become such a sound bite?",46,commenter1126,"*Percentage of total taxes paid* is completely irrelevant, as it ignores the payer size, payee size, and a host of other factors. Example: I make $88 billion a year. I paid $9 in taxes. Ridiculous, right? Except everyone else only paid $1 total, so I tell people ""I paid 90% of total taxes. This is fair."" (hint: it's not)


The real number you should talk about is *Percentage of income paid*, and then only if it includes all sources of income. Example: I make $88 billion a year. I pay 15% in taxes, so I pay $13.2 billion in taxes. Much more sensible than a $9 income tax because the relations are actually there. Now it's time to argue over whether that 15% is fair or not, and the discussion will actually have merit.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l21fo/how_did_percentage_of_total_taxes_paid_an/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442333112,1444728182
