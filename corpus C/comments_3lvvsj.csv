He'll be an advisor without the official title. He'll probably spend most of his time with the Clinton Foundation. He'll also likely fulfill the common role of the First Lady by being host during official gatherings. He has plenty of connections that will come in handy as well. Former Presidents are sometimes asked to represent the US for ceremonial purposes. He probably won't be hanging around the situation room too much though.",28,0,1442888262,1444725581

I realize theres tradition for the role, but it's not like theres any rules dictating what a First lady/gentleman can & can't do....and since Bill is a former president I'm not exactly sure how much tradition will apply to what he does with his position",1,0,1442944979,1444725589

Well as you said there are no rules and it's not ""his"" position or rather wouldn't be automatically if Hillary is elected. Someone is going to have to run the house along with the social secretary, florist, chief of staff, and press secretary. Even if Bill claims the title of First Gentleman someone else will very likely fill the role that Michele, Laura, Hillary herself, Barbara, etc. filled making that person de facto First Whatever.
