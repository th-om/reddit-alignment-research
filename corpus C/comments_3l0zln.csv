Carson's plan is to create a health savings account from birth, with I believe $2000 added yearly by either the government or employer (and this would in total only amount to $700 billion a year for the government, even if every American went through the government).

Different parts of that money are used for different purposes (insurance for catastrophes), and the funds are transferable within a family.

Scott Walker wants a tax credit system, where those who cannot afford insurance in the private market are eligible for tax credits.

>The tax-credit system Mr. Walker proposed would provide a tax credit of $900 a year for those 17 years old or younger and escalate to a credit of $3,000 for people between the ages of 50 and 64. It also would increase annual limits on tax-sheltered health savings accounts, a popular program for people in high-deductible plans, and would provide a $1,000 refundable tax credit to anyone who signs up.

So a major part of the problem is caused by goverment, even if they are trying to do well.

Then we look at the VA. The VA is goverment run healthcare, and it is run extreamly poorly. How do we know general healthcare won't turn into the VAv2 if the goverment implements a single payer system? The goverment over all does some things well, and other things very poorly. Healthcare is not one of the things the government does well, so they should stay out of it (not saying they can't put regulations and such on healthcare products and some shifty shit hospitals do). With obamacare being ""The Insurance Care Act"" and basicly enforcing an insurance bracket without doing really any good (The only good thing it did was pre-existing problem coverage) to reign in costs, it actually will exacerbate costs by more of the same as we still won't ever shop around for care because people have 'insurance' and don't pay for costs themselves.

The other thing is size, How can we fund and keep running well a healthcare system for such a large country, hell, most of our states are as large or larger population wise than all of these countries who's single payer healthcare is rated as 'good'.

I am also not a fan of effective 50% tax rates that some of these countries use to pay for all of their healthcare in their small countries.

Our healthcare as it is now is more or less top notch for everyone how the insurance system works, as having a good insurance system basically negates the need to have large ammounts of cash on hand. Not that our insurance system is the best, nor is the way our healthcare system is setup over all due to the reasons i posted before, however its not that private healthcare is bad, its how ours discourages shopping around and how medicare /medicaid / insurance pays the hospitals are the reasons for the ever increasing and sky high pricing, so a large part to blame on our current healthcare system is the goverment and how they handle payment for medical services.

I didn't. We had choices for types and levels of coverage (similar to what is available today) but those choices allowed me to exclude options that I might never use such as children's dental and vision. 

You do understand that rates (on the exchanges) in many states have increased as much as 20% each year. The average family of four now costs over $16000 a year to insure, not including any out of pocket costs. This number is hidden behind the ""subsidy"", so it makes it even harder for the average person to calculate.

but what about your health insurance? you realize that your premiums went toward services that you would never use, right? that's how insurance works. low risk people who don't have many claims essentially subsidize high risk people who have many claims. your premiums have always subsidized services you don't use. why are you all of a sudden getting upset about it?

Google is your friend, but here is your context...The average american family earns about $50K per year. That means that the average cost of insurance is equal to about 1/3 of their total yearly income. Want some more context?

both of your sources show only one state (oregon) with the hefty increases you mentioned. the other states have proposed increases. those can very easily be reduced or even changed to decreases (which happened in one state last year).

> What services was I previously paying for that I would absolutely never use

if someone in your office was pregnant, they used your premiums for prenatal care.
> Google is your friend

i googled ""cost to insure family of 4 over time"" and found nothing recent and nothing that mapped out that average cost over time.

> The average american family earns about $50K per year. That means that the average cost of insurance is equal to about 1/3 of their total yearly income. 

you just compared what it costs to insure a family of 4 to the median annual household income. that is comparing apples and oranges. does the median household have 4 people in your income number?

> The average spend on a mortgage over the course of a year is 25% LESS than the average cost of insurance.

i don't see how comparing a mortgage payment, which is a 30 year loan, to an insurance premium, which has nothing to do with loans, accomplishes anything. ",2,0,1442424824,1444728716

cv2dcjy,0,t1_cv2c8c1,DailyFrance69,"* Abolishing the FDA

Terrible idea. Although the FDA has its faults, it's very much needed to enforce the rigorous standards that are enforced on medication use and testing. Abolishing it would 100% lead to a reduction in standard of care, as it would allow the use of medication that has not been through proper clinical trials and would lead to more use of medication off-label or unlicensed, both of which are dangerous and not scientific.

* Abolish professional licensing

Again, _terrible_ idea. Professional licensing is there to hold medical professionals to a certain standard. Only other professionals in combination with the government are able to correctly ascertain whether their peers meet those standards.

* Deregulating the insurance industry

Would not only lead to soaring costs (since the nature of a product like health care does not allow proper ""competition"" to take place, not to mention the enormous amount of collusion that would take place if the market would be truly unregulated), it would also severely reduce the quality of insurance, as we have empirically observed in the fact that the quality of insurance improved with the ACA regulations.

* Abolishing EMTALA

Highly immoral. A civilized nation does not let her citizens die in the street because they're poor.

Summarising, your ideas manage to be at the same time bad for quality of care, bad for cost of care and additionally highly unethical. I guess you got them from some misguided belief that ""the free market will fix it"" despite there being no empirical evidence for that, and no theoretical support. ",15,0,1442328743,1444728716
