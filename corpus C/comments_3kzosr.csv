**Liberals**

* Economic liberals favor high-equity economics, even if it's to the detriment of growth.

* Minority rights advocates constantly work to advance equality for every minority that faces discrimination, legally and socially.

* Labor advocates care about unions and their chief goal is to increase the bargaining power of workers.

**Conservatives**

* Libertarians favor individual freedoms. That means the freedom to do things that are highly unpopular and may be damaging overall. 

* Religious conservatives have a moral code based on their particular religious tradition, and a legal code based on promoting what they consider the main values therein.

* Economic conservatives favor high-growth economics, even if it's to the detriment of equity. ",9,0,1442284387,1444728738

- the labor point kind of falls under economic equity

- add a point about how social liberals focus on reducing their society's externalities on others (environmentalism, non-interventionist, Healthcare, etc) 

- add a point about how protectionist conservatives focus on protecting their society from others (interventionist policy, immigration, terrorism, etc)

cv1xfww,1,t3_3kzosr,WearyTunes,">What are the core differences in values and assumptions between the left and the right?

Alright, so the tradition of Left v Right wing stems from after the Enlightenment, when the major conflict was over the virtues of Monarchism vs Republicanism.

* The right are people who believe that a certain amount of economic, political, and or social hierarchy are necessary, justified, and or inherently good.

* The left are the opposite, they believe that economic, political, and or social hierarchies are unnecessary, unjustified, and or inherently bad.

>I find it interesting that most people seem to stay on one side for most of their life. Why do you think this is? What core assumptions and values do the left and right hold that make it impossible for them to agree on many things?

Though not a perfect model that explains everything, it has a lot to do with the environment in which political socialization occurs.

Take two interesting cases: Plato and the Protest Movement of the 60's.

Plato was born into a extremely unstable time in Athenian Politics and his political theology displayed this in full. *The Republic* is a guide in building a stable, hierarchical society where the people most fit to rule would do so.

The political ideology of the early, radicalized, 60's protest movement could best be summed up in the opening to the Port Huron Statement: ""We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit."" Those kids were raised in one of the most conservative, and politically apathetic, times that America had seen in ages and, due in part to the election of Kennedy and the Civil Rights Movement, decided that things had to change.

Not to imply that political socialization is in any way this simple.",11,0,1442285460,1444728738

It helps if you focus on only a certain theme in the end goals of an ideology. 

As in, Fascists believe in creating a hierarchical society while Communists believe in creating an unhierarchical society. In the case of right and left wing, nothing else matters.

The political spectrum has always been a much more limited concept than people believe it to be. This is partially why we see so many people trying to *correct* it by adding an axis or, in a lot of cases, redefining it completely.

cv2c23q,1,t3_3kzosr,pintonium,"It's something that has plagued humanity throughout the ages, for as long as we've tried to govern ourselves. The best book I've read on the subject is A Conflict of Visions by Thomas Sowell - it tries to answer exactly what you are looking for. One of the things he does is differ from the left vs right paradigm. Rather he separates the two visions by putting it on a slider from a ""constrained"" vision of man; meaning that humans are flawed, that some problems can't really be solved - or if they can be solved, they will come at a very steep cost, and that there is a thin line between civilization and barbarism. By contrast, those associated with the left (but not always) have the view of man as ""unconstrained"". This view is characterized by an idea that man can rise above his situation, its an ultimate view that we can create enlightened leaders that will show us the path, the view that you cannot judge actions without considering the intentions behind the actions (they matter almost equally) and that we are not beholden to the past when trying to make decisions about how we want society to be (basically the disdain for tradition).

This is by no means exhaustive, but it is one of the best books on how there seems to be such a disconnect between those on the left and right.
