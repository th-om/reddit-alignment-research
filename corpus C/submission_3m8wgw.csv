3m8wgw,I have been seeing a lot of articles about how Ahmad perpetrated the whole clock story. Is this a hoax that people may want to distance themselves from?,284,atomicpete,"You know how you periodically investigate a kick-starter, going over public pictures and asking real questions about “is this real”?

The difference in the way you are approaching Ahmed’s clock and a random kickstarter is really really painful to watch. Your credibility is on the line here and you really really need to say “yeah okay we were taken in by a story that was too good to check”.

In recent days here are some details that are starting to come out:

•There was no ""school project"" or science assignment to justify Mohamed bringing the device to school .
• Just three weeks into his freshman year, Mohamed was no ""science whiz well-known by high school teachers for tinkering.""
• The ""clock"" wasn't made from scratch but just the guts of a mass-manufactured digital clock, complete with AC cord and 9-volt backup battery connection.
• With its exposed wires and lack of a face, the gutted clock looked like a bomb. It also sounded like a bomb: The alarm was set to go off during English class; the beeping startled the teacher who called police.
• Mohamed father — reportedly asked the cops to re-handcuff his son — so his daughter could take the photo that went viral.
