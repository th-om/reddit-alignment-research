3mspq8,Could Single Payer health care work as a state run agency?,22,revanyo,"I consider myself to be a libertarian type and most of us are against government run health care. However, I always see the argument for SP by people pointing to Europe and their systems. 

Now the usual counter point is the huge difference in population.

However, could it work state by state.  No more Medicare, medicaid, ACA, ect. But a single payer system. Some small states could join up like Rhode Island and Connecticut, Other could split into smaller regions. 

Then the state would just emulate the systems that work in Australia or France.  ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mspq8/could_single_payer_health_care_work_as_a_state/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443502920,1444722488
