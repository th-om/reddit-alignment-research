Right.  A result of the Benghazi committee has been an uncovering of various issues concerning Clinton that have directly impacted her poll numbers.

It is a leap to assume that the committee is *because* they wanted her numbers to drop.  It would be a dereliction of duty *not* to use the House's investigative powers on the Benghazi fiasco given what occurred there regardless of whether the investigation turned up nothing on Benghazi itself.

> You'd have a point if all the republicans on the special committee hadn't spent the last 1.5-2 years vehemently denying that this has anything to do with Clinton & is instead entirely about discovering the ""truth"" of Benghazi

I don't see anything that contradicts it here.  One of the key reasons they looked into Benghazi at all was because of Obama and Rice's comments on the matter.

> Explain how an investigation into the terrorist attack that killed 4 Americans at a U.S. consulate in Libya has justified the last year and a half of investigating Hillary Clinton's emails

Ever heard the term ""it's not the crime, it's the cover up?""  Apply it here a bit.  In the process of investigating Benghazi (which, again, is 100% justifiable), the discovery of Clinton's private email server occurred.  This results in a situation where they now have the reason to look into whether classified material was passed along in contravention with statute and record-keeping rules.

This was a valid point in late-2012/early-2013...it hasn't been a valid point for nearly 3 years...especially considering that you literally just admitted the investigation has turned up nothing on the actual Benghazi attack, which is the sole reason this committee/investigations exist in the first place...

>I don't see anything that contradicts it here. One of the key reasons they looked into Benghazi at all was because of Obama and Rice's comments on the matter

And one of the very first things this investigation/committee discovered was the reason for Obama, Rice, & Clinton's comments on the matter: They were talking points given by the CIA while the hunt for the perpetrators of the attack was underway --- Petraeus testified to this in November of 2012...2 years & 11 months ago...and, as this post is fully demonstrating, people who support the Benghazi committee/investigations have never stopped talking about the internet-video/protests as being the #1 unanswered question...despite the fact that it was fully answered a couple months after the actual attacks occurred. Which, imho, is proof that the people who care most about these investigations also care the least about what the investigations actually find.

>Ever heard the term ""it's not the crime, it's the cover up?"" Apply it here a bit.

***WHAT ""COVER UP""?!***

 I would apply it if it made *any* sense whatsoever to this situation --- These investigations have been the definition of starting with an end result & working backwards in an attempt to find evidence that fits a desired outcome...which is the exact opposite of what an objective investigation is supposed to do, and (before yesterday) the GOP has always claimed that the investigations were only about discovering the objective truth behind the Benghazi attacks

>This results in a situation where they now have the reason to look into whether classified material was passed along in contravention with statute and record-keeping rules.

You are correct though - McCarthy can't describe actual successes they've had during his time in the Leadership, as there aren't really any other than holding the line on spending via the Sequester, so pretty much the best he can do is tout their witch-hunt against Clinton.

Yes. You should try to provide citations on that topic. What I find is ""un named analysts are responsible for false reports on a protest that did not occur""...

Now if you remove yourself from it all for a minute and think about it - while it can make sense that the Media would confuse protests in Egypt with Protests in Libya... the actual people in charge at the embassy and in the White House are the ones who are talking to each other, right? So when all is said and done the un named analyst and reporters who got it wrong - those are not the people the white house is going to rely on for reports, right? They will rely on the actual people there and what they were reporting - right? Especially weeks later?

Feel free to show me the examples you mean.

I've also noticed that you haven't at all discussed the way the US bombed libya in most of 2011, and by 2012 had not helped restore order in Libya. Instead, the US and France and UK all pointed to Libya as a triumph. Right up until the attack in 2012 - and then it was outrage that anyone would want to talk about Libya at all.

Of course that triumph is still not a real democracy, has no military or police force, and is a new base for ISIS...

I think you are doing some selective nit picking regarding terrorist attacks. The VAST majority of the incidents cited in your link took place in Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia. The middle east was (and virtually still is) a war zone, and many of these ""terrorist attacks"" were IED's or suicide bombers in legitimate war zones. Again, from what I read, not a single US ambassador dies in any of the incidents mentioned. 

Seriously...please explain how you call this a terrorist attack on a US consulate -

Three of the contractors died instantly, and the fourth died in a military hospital after the bombing.

You are right in that the GOP could do a much better job painting the entire picture and not just focusing on the one word Bengahzi.

I can go on and on with related and important questions. Why is it none of the people who were there are allowed to give interviews or explain what happened?

I can find an interview, a few of them actually, staring the mother of one of the people who died, explaining that Hillary insisted it was all because of a video and protest. By why not from the people there?

How has the US strategy of Bombing Libya for 10 months in 2011 turned out for both the US and Libya? Did anyone in the military suggest restoring order there? How do we prevent political narratives from trumping that security?

It's irrelevant. We found out the reason for this within a few months of the attack: The CIA requested for that narrative to be used while the situation was still fluid & the perpetrators of the attack were still being investigated. The CIA gave out a memo with the talking points...iirc this info was provided in the 1st or 2nd hearing over Benghazi, either way it was public knowledge within 4-5 months of the attack

If you actually cared about what the investigations found out, then you wouldn't be talking about the protest talking points...but that seems to be the one & only thing you care about that actually pertains to the attack

>Quite a bit. Perhaps you noticed how much I wrote in the thread about it.

Your idea that there is no connection here continues to illustrate why it is worth talking about.

You do know Bengahzi is in Libya, right? That the US and France and UK bombed that country for all of 2011, destroyed the government, abandoned it, said there was no need to help secure it, and then had the embassy attaked in 2012 on the 9/11 anniversary right?

That specifically cost the lives of an ambassador and 4 Americans...
In a country we specifically destabilized and didn't help recover...

This issue persists today. Libya still has not been stabilized. The region has become more chaotic, not less. These investigations most certainly roll over into discussions on Syria. One thing I learned was that there was some kind of arms deal going down that was CIA clandestine operations... something I would have never heard from the ""This was a random protest sparked by an internet video"" crowd.
