3mh05m,"If Republicans win in 2016, be prepared for a conservative New Deal",74,garfangle,"It is my theory that if the Republicans win the presidency in 2016 and with it retain control of Congress that the American public should be prepared for a conservative version of the New Deal.

The major frustration of conservatives over the past 25 years has been that even though they have been in charge of the government off and on over this time period their policy priorities have either not been enacted, overturned by subsequent Democratic administrations, or thwarted by the Supreme Court even though a majority of the Justices have been appointed by Republicans.

There are plenty of ideas that have been brewing quietly in conservative think tanks that will get a fair hearing by the next Republican president and that many will be introduced as legislation even if not all become law.

You may think that Democrats will still have the filibuster to block these Republican proposals, but my guess is that when push comes to shove it will be discarded rather than have Sen. Harry Reid dictating Senate priorities. Therefore, with legislation requiring only a simple majority many ideas that liberals/progressive loathe but conservatives like, everything from defunding Planned Parenthood to reforming entitlement programs to enacting Right-to-Work union laws will stand a good chance of becoming the law of the land and thus ushering in the conservative political equivalent of FDR's New Deal.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mh05m/if_republicans_win_in_2016_be_prepared_for_a/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443280724,1444723409
