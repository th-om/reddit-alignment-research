cv86urv,1,t3_3lpgmm,Rooster_Ties,"Almost nothing.  If he hasn't connected with at least 5% of Republicans by this point, then I think his campaign is over.  Especially since expectations were so high going into the race, specifically for Walker.

Early on he was the #1 front-runner *in Iowa* (specifically Iowa only) -- and now he can barely get any support there at all.

Since he has almost completely failed to meet expectations, I think short of most of the other candidates officially getting out of the race, he has almost no chance at all to build any new momentum.",8,0,1442777808,1444726332

cv8iprf,1,t3_3lpgmm,lmaoo-sure,"Walker hasn't done anything to stand out from the pack. I guess he just assumed that he'd be a shoe in with Koch Brother backing. He lacks charisma in a field with a surplus of it. Imo he should come out against Trump if he wants to stay relevant. Challenge him, Carly, or Carson directly and see if anything he says sticks. We're still a couple months away from the primary, so anything could happen. However, he's run a really poor campaign, lacks the kind of personality that wins these sorts of elections, and doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. Barring some sort of miracle, he's done.
