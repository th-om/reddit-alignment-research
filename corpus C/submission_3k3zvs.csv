3k3zvs,"Minimum wage supporters: why does the free market and market equilibrium not work for wages in low income jobs when it seems to work for other, higher income jobs?",53,BUbears17,"I ask this because it's something that's been on my mind a lot lately. I've always been supportive of some sort of minimum wage increase, however as i've looked into it I've hit a road block that I don't know how to feel about. for jobs above minimum wage market equilibrium is used to get workers into jobs that are best paying/benefitial for their level of skill and experience, it's not perfect but it works. So why does this not work for minimum wage jobs as well? and if it does work then why would we need a minimum wage?

and if i'm way off on my idea of market equilibrium for wages then please correct me and explain why it's wrong or an inappropriate use of the idea of supply and demand.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3k3zvs/minimum_wage_supporters_why_does_the_free_market/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441729642,1444731486
