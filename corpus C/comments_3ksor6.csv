I mean,[ PPP did a poll last week](http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article34403052.html) that went Hillary (54), Biden (24), Bernie (9).

Quinnipac has Iowa at a 1 point difference, and NBC has Bernie by 11.

Oh, and polls still give Hillary a 30+ point lead in Florida, and a 20+ point lead nationally.

It doesn't really matter much what pollster you look at. In polling with data covering the period between, say, August 13 and September 13, 2007, there were three nationwide polls, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates), putting Obama at 21%, 23%, and 27%, averaging 23.6%. Over the same part of 2015, Bernie Sanders [has polled at](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2016_presidential_primaries): 31%, 28%, 21%, 27%, 20%, 20%, 23%, 24%, 23%, 24%, 29%, and 30%, averaging 25%.

Those 2007 polls are from Quinnipiac, Fox News, and ABC/WaPo; rated, respectively, B+, C+ and A-. If we restrict things to looking at polls (over the same period) from pollsters with a B or better rating from 538, that gives Obama an average of 24%, while Bernie Sanders averages 26.5%.",3,0,1442182593,1444729364
