cux5ap5,0,t1_cux55ct,Nygmus,"It's not a debate; are you actually reading what I wrote?

The *state* laws that determine how, for example, a county clerk could be removed... are defined by the Kentucky legislature. She's hard to remove because Kentucky state law makes her hard to remove.

The overarching gay rights debate has literally nothing to do with that, because no federal mandate in question here affects how states elect and remove public officials.",4,0,1441917097,1444730432

cux3jve,0,t1_cux35s2,gmonox,"From what I understand (I have limited knowledge on this area, so could be wrong) the county clerk used to be a lot more important, but due to better technology and moving power from small areas like counties to states and the federal government, the county clerk just sort of exists now to do paperwork and rubber stamp things that have already been decided.

Are you suggesting the county clerk should no longer be an elected position? That seems like a sensible position but I'm not sure what else would be affected by that change, or if there are any reasons other than historical reasons that the county clerk is still an elected position.",2,0,1441914422,1444730432
cux4ei9,0,t1_cux3jve,LocalYocal,"That's interesting, thanks for the info. From my understanding of a clerk, the primary purpose is administrative and clerical, they are never to be interpreting the legal code like a judge would. I'm suggesting that we start holding government officals as accountable as society holds us.

cux4uhz,0,t1_cux47gt,LocalYocal,"I understand the legal precedence. Would you disagree that we should perhaps amend the legal code to facilitate some oversight of the position? Protecting a judge against public opinion? I fully support how that protects the integrity of the system. But a county clerk refusing to do her job and file paperwork? If she wanted to impact the judicial system in that manner, she should have become a judge. This is like a DMV employee refusing to give out a driver's license because someone's gay.

I could see calling a deragatory or insulting joke ignorant, but not that. You're basically saying that a potential beard also now has the potential to be a lesbian, which I guess is true. 

I would also argue though that the percentage of gay couples has certainly increased over the years, as it has become more socially acceptable. There are a lot more people in gay relationships today, that probaby would've been married heterosexually 50 years ago, just in the closet. ",-3,0,1441918229,1444730436

cux4vdz,1,t3_3kfuwt,Barology,"Davis was elected by her constituents. The happy power to 'fire her' lies with the state legislature. The Governor has decided not to call a special session to deal with her, as the courts are serving their exact purpose. If any elected official could be sacked with ease then this would be a generally less free county. Yes, she broke the law; and she has been held to account for that. The system is working exactly how it should. 

More broadly I don't think this case it lluminates some flaw in our system of government. She absolutely should not have committed the crime she did, but once she did so she was dealt with fairly swiftly. I wouldn't want the process to work a whole lot faster in this type of case. It was a fairly clear violation of the law which was handled exactly appropriately for a nation of laws. ",1,0,1441916442,1444730436
