Not completely true.  Companies that don't exist now because minimum wage laws might become viable.  However, this does not mean they would be able to 'pay more' and remain viable. 

Moreover, cutting costs doesn't mean it all goes into someone's wallet.  You can bet some companies will reinvest the extra money to expand or be more competitive, which would compel other companies to do the same (or lose market share).  This creates more jobs and more economic growth.

More police would be a solution, and perhaps mandatory work- if someone is unemployed and able to work, they could be required to have a job for a certain number of hours per week. 

Now THAT leads to an issue where employers are being overrun with people who are mandated to work, so we either have to make the employers hire people they can't afford or have a bunch of unemployed people still, so the best solution is to reduce the minimum wage further- freeing our job creators from the burden of having to pay out a bunch of money. The obvious solution is to just eliminate the minimum wage altogether. 

That way, an employer could pay the government a one-time fee, and have a mandatory worker they could assign work to, so long as they took care of their food and board.

I'm suspecting the above argument was ad hominem? An invalid categorial syllogism? *Onus Probandi*? I'll make it easy: [here's a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies), just pick one mad libs style and cite it like everyone should be on a first name basis with good old *Ignoratio elenchi*. 

Most people won't bother looking it up and even if they do, they won't waste the effort typing out the two hundred words necessary to explain why ""it didn't rain on Tuesday"" really isn't a classic example of retrospective determinism.  Especially since after they do, they'll only be accused of *post hoc ergo proctor hoc* or some other low-effort response.

But what the heck? Let's wade into equivocation.

Wikipedia cites the classic example of equivocation as such:

>A feather is light.    
What is light cannot be dark.    
Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

See, that statement is using the dual meaning to serve as a step in a logical argument. It is basing the final statement on the use of the word like a hinge. There's an easy way to test for this one: if you change out either occurrence of the word ""light"" with a synonym, the argument falls apart like so:

>A feather is airy.   
What is light cannot be dark.   
Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

or...

>A feather is light.  
What is well-lit cannot be dark.  
Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.

The argument depends upon the dual meaning, without it, the argument turns into seemingly unrelated statements. 

Now let's put my statement above to the same test:

>theoretically satisfying the minimum requirements to live isn't the same thing as living.

Now let's get rid of both occurrences of the offending verb ""live"":

>theoretically satisfying the minimum requirements to sustain biological function isn't the same thing as having a bearable experience in your world.

Look at that, the point I was attempting to make still stands. You don't have to agree with it- I suspect nothing could make that happen, but equivocation it ain't. What it was, was wordplay. I was being whimsical in my phrasing, and indulging in a small pun. This was, I can assure you, well within my budget.

Actually I do agree with *that* point, but that wasn't the original claim.

The equivocation is making claims about what it takes to live, and then later making claims about living without making the distinction.

>I was being whimsical in my phrasing, and indulging in a small pun. This was, I can assure you, well within my budget.

Heh, fair enough.

Look I'm not saying what one can live on isn't all what should be aspired to or accepted as good enough so let's not do anything else. 

I'm saying there's a big difference between making claims about what it takes to survive, and what it takes enjoy a particular quality of life.

Survival is more salient claim to make politically. People nearly universally see others as having a right to be alive, but a particular quality of life is much more subjective, and people disagree far more on the level of quality of life people are entitled to. 

You can make a claim about what quality of life people are entitled to, but it's a much harder argument to make. It's easy to pull at heartstrings and call things a starvation wage even when it isn't. ",1,0,1441945164,1444730911

Wages make up a tiny fraction of the cost of a Walmart product's retail price, so prices at Walmart would not fall.  If you buy something for $1, less than 5 cents of that is due to labor costs.  Even if labor went to zero (everyone worked for free) that thing would still have to cost at least 95 cents.
