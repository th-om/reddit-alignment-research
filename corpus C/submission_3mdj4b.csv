3mdj4b,What is a somewhat non-biased clarification of the true meaning of supply side economics?,67,,"I keep seeing this common exchange:

>""Stupid Reagan and trickle down economics.""

>""Trickle down economics is not even a thing--nobody believes in that. It's called supply side economics.""

>""Dude, that's literally the same thing.""

The liberals claim that trickle down economics is simply giving rich people tax cuts, in the hope that this means that rich people will be able to create more jobs. Liberals call this simply giving money to rich people, and these policies come in place because rich people control politics (which is a whole different debate).

From what I've seen of conservatives on this side (and I don't see it often), supply side simply means improving the ease of doing business, streamlining regulations, etc. When put that way, I would definitely agree with such policies, (not necessarily with the financial industry in certain places), because ease of doing business in a country is very important for strong growth. I don't see tax cuts emphasized as much.

So, the question I pose is, what is the actual difference? And why is trickle down economics a myth while supply side isn't? Is trickle down the liberal definition and supply side a more all-encompassing term?

I feel like everyone gets into all sorts of arguments over this, but few people on Reddit ever actually discuss the merits of it. This post was not intended to be controversial debate, but rather explanation.

Any good sources to really understand the difference? And I'm not talking something like Think Progress or CATO--something more informational or widely reputable by economists.

Lastly, if anyone has read it, or perhaps has the time to read it, what are your thoughts on this criticism of supply side economics:

Thanks!

In addition, it'd be really helpful if you added your economic slants beforehand, just so I can have a better idea of where bias exists.
