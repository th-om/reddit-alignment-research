Senator Warren essentially became the unofficial mascot of the Occupy Movement by adopting their rhetoric that appealed to large swaths of voters, namely going after Big Bank, highlighting the growing income inequality in the nation, making the minimum wage a livable wage, etc. Senator Warren never led a protest or camped out with them on Wall Street (as far as I know), but she did help bring attention to their cause. She may have met with them a few times, and praised them on TV, but past that, she never tied herself to them. That being said, it also helps that she is from one of the most liberal states in the nation, so being associated with them isn't all that bad.

Typically, grassroots movements on either side of the aisle (Tea Party for the Republicans/Occupy for the Democrats) see this same adoption of certain positions and rhetoric by politicians. Maintaining viable, independent movements in the US is a difficult thing to do in a two party system. ",3,0,1442844499,1444726196
cv8zi4o,1,t3_3lsvos,maddata,"Really depends on who you are.  If we're talking presidential election, it's not a good thing.  You want to appeal to the center in order to win a presidential election, so being associated with an extreme group (like Occupy, or BLM) isn't going to help you.  For perspective, imagine if a candidate was associated with Oath Keepers or the KKK.",4,0,1442843346,1444726196
cv903ih,0,t1_cv8zi4o,FuzzyLoveRabbit,"I agree with your point about trying to win the center, but I'm not so sure about that end comparison.

Occupy and BLM have their faults, but they don't bring their guns as an important part of their protest and point them at government agents (Oath Keepers) or have a terrible history as a violent hate group (KKK).",14,0,1442844518,1444726196

It's good if you're associated with the causes they support, though. If you can attach yourself to fighting inequality or racial bias in law enforcement without being tied to the movement, you will be successful.",1,0,1442869768,1444726196
