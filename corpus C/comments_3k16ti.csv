The Iraqi government under Saddam was secular but it was also controlled by Baathist party. When Saddam fell the US kicked everyone that worked for the former Iraqi government out of their jobs and implimented and entirely new government. That sounds nice in theory to make sure Saddam loyalists didnt remain in power but in reality very few people, even those that worked in the government, supported Saddam. 

In practice what ended up happening was that the US kicked everyone out of office from the highest to lowest order rendering the new Iraqi government totally inept and pissing off everyone who lost their jobs. The result was a government with zero user exsperience and a large group of people, some of which even supported the ""liberation"", who quickly became disenfranchised because they were immediately rendered unemployed. 

When ISIS began to take power many from the former Baathist party supported them and the current people running the Iraqi government (and military) figuratively and literally ran away. If the Bush administration hadn't ostracized the individuals who A. Knew how to run Iraq, and B. became quickly upset with the US government after losing their jobs IS wouldn't have had the support they needed to run over Iraq or Syria the way they did. 

Furhermore, many of the US prisons in Iraq are directly attributed to creating ISIS by providing a hot bed of extremism and allowing inmates to organize. Beyond that Saddam ran a secular government. He was a total tyrant but one thing he was good at was keeping out religious exgremism. When we toppled him in the name of false promises of WMDs we created the very power vacuum needed for IS to grow. The US is one of the main reasons thst organization exists today.

>The non extremist anti Asad groups have been decimated by both Asad and ISIS which is why they've effectively been totally unable to move forward as of late.

They've been battered by Asad far more than ISIS.  ISIS has difficulty fighting motivated troops(the Free Syrian Army, The Peshmerga in Iraq, Shi'ite Militias in Iraq).  Again, ISIS is not substantially prolonging the war, because they can only materially affect areas of the country that won't change the outcome of the actual war.

>If you watch any interviews from the people fleeing Syria right now they say that they're leaving because of IS not Asad.

Yes, because it's what the public in the West knows.  Everyone knows about ISIS because the US and other countries are bombing them.  It's a good PR tactic.  *I do not blame them for using this as a public reason*.  But it doesn't change the fact that the people fleeing haven't encountered large ISIS formations, they're fleeing the being in the crossfire between the Asad regime and the umbrella resistance groups like the SRCC.

We had a clear engame. Oust Saddam and reinstate a democratic government. And the Shia government was not at odds with the majority. [On the contrary the majority of Iraq (70-75%) is Shia.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Iraq). Our bombing campaigns were designed to destroy the military infrastructure and though public utilities were destroyed as well, we were well underway in restoring water to Iraq. What compounded the restoration lag was the fundamentalist insurgency and a UN sanction prohibiting chemicals such as chlorine frome being imported for sanitation. 

>This the issue we have everyone we invade a country we don't understand and it started when colonialism divided the middle east into arbitrary countries that divided tribes, and made countries out of others that hated each other solely because Europe wanted it that way when they didn't understand any of the local customs.

We understood the country and the risks. The problem is that Europe and the UN seem to desperately try to hold on to their bad decisions over 100 years ago and their lack of commitment to fixing it. Iraq should really be 3 nations but because of the last 100 years, fighting would continue due to oil reserve ownership disputes. That makes it nearly impossible to divide the country. Compound that with Iraqs stupid religious intolerance and we have a problem that cannot be fixed in 7 years. Maybe in a generation.

It also isnt right to allow others to come into our home because they dont want to clean theirs up. Mexico and latin america in general are good examples of that. As far as instating a new government, sure, it would likely not be very kind to the oligarchs and Alawite Minority that have brutally dominated the country since Hafez Al-Assad assumed power. Thats a given. And it is deservedly so. 

>As I said earlier, Iraq had more issues than us simply leaving. Which by the way was done because Iraq wanted us gone just as much as our population did.

I hear this way too much. It is completely untrue. Iraqi government officials didnt want a full withdraw in such abrupt fashion, they wanted a draw down and transition to a new, stable, Iraq. One with actual police and military capability. The American left wasnt satisfied with this and when Obama took office it was largely misconstrued that the Iraqi people wanted us to leave as fast as possible in order to support the obama administration and democrats domestically. It was a self serving decision by the democrats to do this, and it worked pretty well for support here at home. Now that people have wised up though, Republicans have again gained control of the congress. No small part of that is due solely to domestic policy moves. 

>Nation building can be done right. Germany 1945 didn't take 7 years, S. Korea didn't take long. It's because a plan was in place which had clear goals, one that didn't include destroying the utilities or setting up a divisive government.

It did take much longer than that. Until the end of the cold war and the reunification of germany with the fall of the Soviet Union in fact. And Germany was completely destroyed after the war. [Completely](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_of_Germany). The other key difference is that it was an Allied operation to rebuild and invest in germany. This meant every allied nation had a part in it. In Iraq this was not the case. And Germany was indeed divided at the end of the war by the Allies and the Soviets.

Why?  We weren't responsible for the Syrian Civil War, by any stretch.  People keep on acting as if the Invasion of Iraq is what caused the SCW, without actually providing a compelling case beyond a gut feeling.

How did the toppling of the Hussein regime cause the Syrian Civil War?  Violence didn't ""bleed over"" into Syria, for example.  The new Iraqi government didn't fund any Syrian rebels.  Hell, ISIS started in Syria, not Iraq.

If any external force caused the SCW, it was the Arab Spring.  Something that, again, you can't really claim that the actions of the US Government are responsible for.
