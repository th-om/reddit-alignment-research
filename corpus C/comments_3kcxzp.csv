We convinced these other countries that if we imposed sanctions it would bring Iran to the negotiating table.  They have explicitly said that if we reject the agreement, they will lift the sanctions. (which also makes the US look very, very stupid and impotent)

Considering that oil is by far the primary export, it really only takes one country that is willing to deal with them to buy their entire supply; India, China, Brazil etc. could easily form a unilateral agreement to buy their oil, rendering US and allied sanctions completely ineffective.",4,0,1441905126,1444730834

""Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate."" - John F. Kennedy

[Wikipedia article about the deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiations_leading_to_the_Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action).

To start off, the deal is not one between the United States and Iran.   It's a deal between Iran on one side, and on the other the US, UK, France, China, Russia, the EU and Germany.   The US is only one of the nations in the group negotiating with Iran.   

The facts of the matter are this.... ONLY Republicans in the Untied States wish to continue sanctions against Iran.  Nobody else in the world wants that.    This includes pretty much every single US Allie on Planet Earth save Israel.     If the United States does not approve the deal, then our EU and NATO allies, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, etc.  are going to discontinue sanctions anyway.   And so will Russia and China.  Which means the Iranians will be allowed to buy anything they want from anyone except the United States.  

The money you mention ($100 Billion) that is gong to be given to Iran is owned by Iran. It is for the most part NOT currently held by the United States, which only holds $2.8 billion (less than 3% of it) , but by the rest of the world.   The rest of the world that if the deal doesn't get approved will promptly give it back to the Iranians anyway.   In other words, Iran was going to get that money back regardless of the deals approval either way.    

Also, the deal limits the Iranian nuclear program.   Don't do the deal and the current non-limits on their nuclear program will stay in place.   In effect, the Republicans would quickly hand the Iranians a nuclear bomb to use at their leisure.  While the deal prevents them, for a time, from becoming a nuclear state.  The only thing that prevents them from becoming a nuclear power is a sheet of paper called the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty.   Nothing else.   This deal will put a regimen in place that will place other obstacles in their way.  

It's a lot of carrot and sticks.  Make the agreement and the United States will have some leverage over the Iranians.  Don't make it, and have no leverage and watch the Rest of the world implement their parts of it regardless of American disapproval.   The rest of the world just views the entire US Foreign policy in the Middle East as a giant failure they want no part of anymore.  And they are willing to break with the United States if congress rejected the deal.  

BTW, the President gets to veto any attempt at Congressional Disapproval of the deal.  Which is why Congress would need 2/3rds of each house to override the Presidents potential veto.  Which means that since 41 Senators  have stated they are going to vote for approval of the deal, that it's going to be approved since they can not override the veto.  

Reject the deal and Iran wins everything, gets to continue nuclear weapons development and loses only $2.8 billion held by the Untied States.   Approval the deal and get large limits placed on the Iranian nuclear program and keeps the international team putting combined pressure on Iran united.  

Really, nobody in their right mind who knows anything about this deal can be against it.   The only reason to be against it is if you want to invade Iran before the end of the year.  And the United States couldn't even invade and win in Iraq.   Iran is a county three times the size of Iraq in both area and population.   The only way for the United States to beat Iran in a war would be to use nuclear weapons on a massive scale and murder people in such numbers as to make the Nazis and Soviets look like amateurs.

That's really what a lot of this comes down to.  It's an objectively terrible deal all around, but the administration wants to call it a win because they are uniquely incapable of chalking up anything to a loss.  

There's a fundamental difference in the quality of man Obama is versus any number of former presidents.  When Bush was asked about what he thought some of his biggest mistakes were, he mentioned saying ""mission accomplished"" on the aircraft carrier.  It was a moment where we all saw that the man genuinely reflected on his decisions and honestly evaluated them.  When Obama is asked three years from now the exact same question, the best you can hope for is ""thinking the Republicans would work with me.""  

As I said, he is uniquely incapable of admitting any fault however slight it may be, and it shows even now in this deal.  The administration got nothing, literally nothing, it said it was trying to get in the beginning.  Not one damned thing.  And, in the end, the best Obama and Kerry can muster up is this bogus set of ""terms"" that are ludicrously incomplete as we keep finding out.  

Their overt efforts to hide details from Congress would raise red flags for most people under normal circumstances, but this era's Democrats are more content to tow the line and act like suspicion is due on the person who dared question their leaders regardless of the abject stupidity of their leadership's actions.
