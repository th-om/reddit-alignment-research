cvje0rg,1,t3_3mz9p6,lollersauce914,"I'd argue that 1-3 are all big reasons. Obama himself really hasn't been crazy far left in most of his presidency. 

Politics in the US have been growing more polarized for decades. I think it's definitely in part because our society has an easier time only engaging with viewpoints that agree with their own than ever before. Also, mostly as a result of how electoral politics in the US work, more extreme candidates on both the left and right have made it into congress at the expense of moderates.",6,0,1443628479,1444721486
cvjhh14,1,t3_3mz9p6,thatnameagain,"> Is it because they are actually more divided than compared to 10 years ago, 20 years, etc.

Yes. There are fewer moderates than before.

>Is it because of news media becoming more polarized?

No. The media reports the polarization, they do not create it, though they do give people on either side a forum to air their views but that's not a bad thing. 

>Is it because the Tea Party pulled the R's further right than they've ever been?

That is certainly a big part of it. 

>Is it because Obama is the furthest-left president since Careter or LBJ?

Meaning ""more left than Clinton, the one democrat president between him and Carter?"" Well sure that's part of it. The only policy of Obama's that can really be said to be a major contributor to the situation from the left is Obamacare, but that has more to do with the scope of the reforms rather since it's more of a center-left policy than a far-left one. 

You forgot to mention voters. Voters are more polarized, and that's the cause. There are two extremely divergent narratives about the role of government that are popular in the U.S. at the moment. ",3,0,1443633407,1444721486

Yes, by a [variety of measures](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/), no one alive today has lived through a period of time where we were more divided than we are now.

> Is it because of news media becoming more polarized? 

Certainly the news hasn't helped, but i'd really say the internet more than anything else makes it really easy to surround yourself with people or media who share your own political views, and eventually build up a self-reinforcing feedback loop of negativity towards those who align with different political philosophies.

> Is it because the Tea Party pulled the R's further right than they've ever been? 

I think that's more of a symptom than a cause, the partisan divide starts long before the Tea Party entered the political scene.

> Is it because Obama is the furthest-left president since Careter or LBJ?

Assuming you are saying Carter, that's not really saying much, as we have had only two left leaning Presidents since Carter, including Obama.",2,0,1443630112,1444721486

cvjjcek,1,t3_3mz9p6,tuna_HP,"The Democrats don't play hard enough. Its like a fight where the Republicans are playing by UFC ""rules"" and the Democrats are playing with boxing rules. The Republicans continuously utilize scorched earth political strategies because they know that the Democrats will never retaliate proportionally.

Democrats need to get their heads out of their asses and realize that these inbred people aren't going to stop ruining the country until they have been put down hard.

Things that Democrats could do to put republican-voting constituencies in their place:

1. Pass a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Senate, or something like that, so that small states don't have disproportionate political power, which due to most small states leaning Republican is a huge boon for them.
2. Pass a law to make voting mandatory, and a law to allow felons to vote, because people who would vote Democrat are less likely to vote and because felons are also likely to vote Democrat
3. Pass laws to cut republican moocher states off the Northern dole. Most republican-leaning states are relatively poor, unproductive and uneducated, and they receive a huge redistribution of federal spending coming from taxes collected in educated, productive, hard working Democratic leaning states. Pass laws to keep Northern money in Northern states and let the republican-leaning southern states deal with the consequences of their moronic policies without sucking on the Democratic tit.
4. Pass a law that makes flying the Confederate flag or proclaiming that ""The South Will Rise Again"" treason punishable by death, because after all the Confederates were rebel traitors to our nation, and slavers, and generally despicable, and celebrating their terroristic regime really is not much different from celebrating the Nazis.
5. Pass a reparations law that compensates black americans out of assets from the former slave states. Basically the government would have to nationalize a lot of the privately-held land in Southern states and redistribute it to the descendants of slaves.

Stuff like that. Make the Republicans feel a little pain for once. They'll get reasonable really quickly. Its easy to be a Ted Cruz-loving political space cadet when there are no consequences. When their farm gets seized to be redistributed to the descendants of slaves, they'll learn the value of political compromise really quickly.",-5,0,1443636053,1444721486

Punishing people for the sins of their parents is a terrible idea, are you serious? You aren't responsible for what your ancestors did.

Forcing people to vote is also a terrible idea. You can't expect every single person to follow the election, or even care about politics. Instead we should just make voting incredibly easy for those who have any interest at all.

Perhaps Dems should learn to fight harder. But we should fight harder for things that **make sense**. I like being a part of the sane party. If Democrats turned to the things you're suggesting, we would become just as bad as the Tea Party.",1,0,1443656413,1444721490
