That, coincidentally, was also a Public Policy Polling survey. PPP is known for being unethical with their survey design and manipulating data. While I'm sure there are some people that honestly believe Obama is to blame, the wording of the question led people to choose Obama. It was a dichotomous question for a topic that is known to have many responses. Other polls have shown that the majority of blame goes to Mayor Nagin and Gov Kagan, but PPP didn't provide those as options; it was either Bush or Obama. 

PPP wrote that question in order to get a headline saying ""___% of Republicans in LA blame Obama for Katrina Response."" Their goal is attention, not legitimacy. ",2,0,1443024112,1444725139
