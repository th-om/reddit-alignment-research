cv0ujcr,1,t3_3kv981,kevinbaconjames,"This is a surprisingly large phenomenom from what I have observed. A lot of young people (primarily white, college-aged males) were massive fans of Ron Paul in 2012. Many now support his son, but a surprising amount of them now claim to support Bernie Sanders. This isn't necessarily the case for your brother, but here is my theory:

There are two factors which are causing this:

1. These are outsider voters, they feel let down by the political establishment and want to back a revolution or otherwise significantly different policies. 

2. They aren't actually that educated on the political process and are rather choosing to support the ""cool"" candidate of the moment from within their demographic. Bernie is seeing the same wave of support on the internet from young people that Ron Paul did, and many former supporters have got sucked into the hype, because the campaigns ""feel"" similar, even though the economics are in total disagreement",7,0,1442205730,1444729262

How is that even possible? Your brother probably isn't ideologically conservative, he's likely just a low-information voter who has the emotional default positions common to low-information voters.

>As a fiscal conservative, why do you agree or disagree with that statement?

I disagree because the marketplace is an aggregation of demonstrated voluntary relationships, while democracy is the imposition of stated preferences disconnected from economic reality. I don't really know how else to answer your question, other than to say that I fail to see why I should lose control over my person and property because 55% of voters want for me to.

Democracy also introduces further biases due to the nature of the voting algorithms used (FPTP, electoral college, etc), and the bargaining process that arises in trying to reach the median voter.",4,0,1442212265,1444729262
cv0x8n7,1,t3_3kv981,TheNaBr,"I can't wrap my head at all around what your brother is thinking.  Yes, government impacts business and the economy, but the way it impacts the economy matters.  Sounds like he's throwing in the towel and voting for the safety net to me, which is probably the greatest concern among conservatives.  Since he supports Rand, I'm willing to bet he is primarily concerned with individual freedom issues and not economics.",2,0,1442213722,1444729262
cv0umil,1,t3_3kv981,pjabrony,"I disagree. The government ultimately enforces its decisions with force. That makes it different from the voice of the consumer. 

Here's the difference. If consumers really hate, say, Wal-mart, then they can stop buying from them. If enough consumers stop buying, then Wal-mart will either have to change its practices or go out of business. But, maybe not everyone hates Wal-mart. Maybe 90% of people hate Wal-mart, but the other 10% shop there loyally. This is enough to sustain Wal-mart in business.

Fiscal conservatism says that this is a good thing. It is neither Wal-mart's nor their consumers' responsibility to cater to the 90% of people who hate Wal-mart. If Wal-mart's business drives a mom-and-pop store out of business, then it's the mom-and-pop store's problem for not providing enough perceived value to the consumer.

Now, the flip side to this is that you have government subsidizing business, especially big business, and that's bad. But this door was opened by the people who called for regulation. Once the standard has been established that it's acceptable to use the government to aid your cause at the expense of others, then it's no surprise that big business is going to take advantage of that standard.",2,0,1442205945,1444729262
cv0tugt,1,t3_3kv981,Hans_Brickface,"I think sometimes it's necessary in cases where consumers really don't have any other viable options and the good or service in question is a necessity and not just a luxury item. (I know we could get a good debate going over what is a necessity, but I think that's beyond the scope of this topic.)

But I don't generally extend this line of thought as far as liberals do. Like when some of them wanted the government to go after Apple for not letting consumers change the default apps in iOS. (That being said, I don't think jailbreaking should be illegal either.)",1,0,1442204123,1444729262

I've heard a lot of (purely anecdotal) ""*my conservative father/friend/coworker is starting to support Bernie Sanders*"" stories and I'm starting to really doubt their veracity.

Respect Sanders for his straightforwardness or because he ""cares about the people"" or what have you, but any truly conservative/libertarian/non-socialist person should be horrified by the idea of a Sanders administration doing even half of what he wants it to accomplish.

I'll stop short of accusing people of desperately making shit up in order to bolster Sanders' support on the right, but I will say that so much of what I've heard makes no goddamned sense.",1,0,1442246540,1444729262
