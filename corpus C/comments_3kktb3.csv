cuy9a57,1,t3_3kktb3,Revere12,"Both sides have used the filibuster for decades. 

But from 2008-2012 when Republicans were in the minority, filibuster abuse got out of control.  The use of the filibuster doubled when Obama got in the Whitehouse. 

In effect, the GOP set a precedent for filibustering anything proposed by the other side and now that the Democrats are in the minority, they're going to follow suit. It would totally shift the balance of power to allow the GOP to filibuster everything but not act in kind. 

Since abuse of the filibuster is the norm now, yes, it needs to be reformed. But until it is reformed ... the Democrats have every reason to use it as much as they can.

cuyk61o,0,t1_cuy9a57,down42roads,"Its a less accurate statement than you would think. Reid got in the habit of calling cloture votes on basically everything. In fact, from the linked article within your article:

> (To be sure, the minority leader can file cloture on a measure opposed by the majority, but McConnell has filed for cloture in just 16 of the more than 450 times cloture motions have been filed since he became minority leader in 2007, 12 of them during the Bush presidency).

So, by filing a cloture motion, the Majority leader could attempt to limit debate on bills, effectively preventing amendments and forcing an almost immediate vote. So, if the Minority had any objections to a bill whatsoever, they were forced to block cloture for a chance of debate.",1,0,1442019902,1444730008

cuychev,1,t3_3kktb3,DarthGinger,"Let's look at the flip side of that coin shall we?

Republicans set a new precedent when they were last in the minority, using the filibuster to throw up road blocks for almost everything. They used it so much that they broke records. When the Democrats responded by eliminating the filibuster for executive nominations and judicial appointments, the Republicans claimed it was an assault on the very fabric of our democracy.

Now that the Republicans are in the majority, they are singing a different tune. They slam the Democrats for filibustering legislation in the same manner they once did. They have repeatedly flirted with the idea of getting rid of the filibuster altogether.

It doesn't, assuming you know how to read it and contextualize it.  Obama had a record number of appointments available for him to make, so naturally the raw number of filibusters was higher.  As a percentage, though, Democrats filibustered a higher percentage of nominees than Republicans did.
