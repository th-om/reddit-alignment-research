I see people make this claim, and see articles on Breitbart and other conservative outlets saying that she apologized, but I can't find a single quote or clip of her saying anything that can *remotely* be considered an apology.    I'm inclined to think that this claim is completely fabricated. 

>but by the time Crowley interjected, it was obvious that Romney's point was correct.

His claim was very specific and clear.   Romney said: ""I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.""  He had been building to this point for a few sentences and he was clearly asserting that as a factual statement. 

That's when Crowley corrected him, as she should have done, because he was factually incorrect.   

>Obama did not refer to the Benghazi attack as an act of terror

Here is the transcript of Obama's remarks on 09/12, the day after the attack.

>""Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe,"" he said. ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act.

>""I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.""

Where in the quote does Obama refer to Benghazi, specifically, as an act of terror? 

The problem with the claim is that he was simultaneously saying that it was a result of a spontaneous protest over a video. If that were true, it wouldn't have been an act of terror. The speech reads as though he intentionally threw in a line that he'd be able to quote for cover, buried where it would be missed until he drew attention to it, while he misled the country into thinking that it wasn't a terrorist attack.",1,0,1442524142,1444727411

> That's when Crowley corrected him, as she should have done, because he was factually incorrect.

No, he was factually correct.  ""No acts of terror"" is a general statement, not a specific reference to the attacks and, more importantly, was absolutely wordsmithed in a way to ensure that ""no terror attacks under my watch"" remained during a volatile election situation.  To quote Candy Crowley, those of us who note that Obama refrained from calling it terrorism are ""totally correct that [the Obama administration] spent two weeks telling us this was about a tape and that that there was this riot outside the Benghazi consulate which there wasnâ€™t.""",2,0,1442519319,1444727411
