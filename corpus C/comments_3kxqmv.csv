cv1e2mw,1,t3_3kxqmv,snacksinhats,"I don't think so, and I loved Huntsman; he had my vote in the last Republican primary. 

The fact is, he's been out of the picture for too long. A whole generation of voters are not going to know who he is or what he has done. 

A man of his skill and experience best serves our nation by doing what he already does: heading a major foreign relations think-tank. He's a great diplomat, and I'd rather him stay in the foreign policy sphere than get back into ""politics,"" the sport.",14,0,1442254496,1444728926

That sets him up to be the President after next.",5,0,1442260871,1444728926

~100% if the next President is Republican. 50% if the next President is a Democrat, and only that low because he might turn them down. I think there's a better chance than that they offer him the job. Can you think of a more qualified statesperson?

Perhaps I'm being a bit optimistic, though. Both parties have reasons to play politics here.",1,0,1442284796,1444728926

cv7yf7u,0,t1_cv31tgc,JoshuaZ1,"Ok. So I'm willing to bet that if you want, with slightly smaller numbers. So conditional on Kerry not being replaced, you get $30 if the next Sec State is Huntsman and pay $15 if he isn't. How does that sound? ",1,0,1442764804,1444728926
