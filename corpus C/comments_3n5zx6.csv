Smartguns are not a new idea, they are a bad idea though.

Smartguns, guns that dont fire unless held by their ""legitimate"" user, were first researched for police, because ""killed by his own gun"" is a thing for them. Mandating it for civilians is at least a 20 year old idea.

The first problem is that the tech to enable this adds complexity, more complexity means more opportunities to fail, guns are emergency tools, you dont want a complex fire extinguisher, I dont want a complicated gun. Turns out the police dont want it either, some form or another of this kind of tech has existed for over 20 years, I have never heard of a police force using it.

The second is that it wont have the desired aim of making gun owners accountable for their guns, its just a fancy lock, and even fancy locks can be broken. Guns will be stolen and the locks disabled, then sold on to the black market, nothing will change.... except that the fancy lock will raise the price of guns considerably.

The third is that it mandates gun registration and provides government power over transfers, gun ownership isnt just about hunting, sport shooting or self protection, to Americans it has always been about the ability to rebel.

I am not suggesting they will be useful for head to head fighting, indeed I dont claim they assure victory, the only thing civilian arms represent is an option, when speech is silenced, when the courts turn a blind eye, when protests are met with official gunfire, they present an option, fight and possibly die in an effort to reach something better.
The disarmed have no such choice, they can merely beg, beg others to help from the outside, beg the government not to hurt them.

They will stop when guns become such a massive hassle, and so expensive that only the wealthy and those who reeeaaaaallly want them badly can get them, when gun ownership is less than 10% and most of those owners have a single sporting shotgun.

There are many things that could already be done to fight tracking, but they are hard and require work, its far easier for the ATF to send guns to Mexico to generate talking points for more gun control at home.

Serious and honest question, what makes you believe this?

Lets do some alt history, ok?
9/11 happens, but the 4th plane strikes congress in session, killing a plurality of congressman. Martial law gets declared, the pentagon is still smarting from the attack on them so they happily follow the presidents orders.
""convince""? ...  those who fail to follow orders are publicly executed after a trial, the need to convince your soldiers to follow orders soon drops.

Suddenly you have a big ole army full of patriotic fervor and forced obedience to the president, all you have to do is present them an enemy and they will obliterate it to rounds of public applause. And no congress to restrain it.
I dont have confidence in our systems ability to withstand that test.
But, for the most part, government tyranny is a slow creep, not a sudden strike.

>the overwhelming force that they can bring to bear is so asymmetric as to render the tiny, tiny percentage of citizens that would actually take up arms moot, no matter how many semi-automatic assault rifles they owned.

This has been true for over 40 years, yet asymetric warfare continues to be a thing that stymies governments, even outright totalitarians cant manage it.

>The right to military cosplay doesn't trump the right to basic safety for the rest of the populace.

Are you good with the same types of prior restraints applying to other rights?

Also, I dont own a gun because it makes me feel safe, its not emotional.

>The fact that places like Chuck's Guns are still open and have never faced any sort of criminal charges are a sign of some major dysfunction.

I read the article you linked, how would you shut them down?
Because its pretty clear they follow the law, if they didnt they would already be shut down, ""lots of criminal guns came from here"" is not proof of actual wrongdoing.

I remember operation gunsmoke, it was a backdoor attempt to use government funded frivolous lawsuits to break gunmakers, because lawyers are expensive. I find that effort reprehensible and any article that mentions it in a good light is biased.

>There's got to be some middle ground. 

For decades there has been an appeal for middle ground, but the middle ground always seems to be on the gun owner side of the debate, and when that middle ground is taken, a new middle ground appears right beside it.
Thats why we are in a stonewall situation, and its hard to argue for an end to that wall when politicians say out loud that they will get ""whatever they can""

>I don't even want to take everyone's guns away, or even really make it harder to obtain them for the responsible owner. I do think more accountability for problem retailers is a good first step, as well as some sort of minimal oversight for private sales.

The power of the ATF was trimmed down because they abused their power in the late 90s, politics then wasnt much different, so lacking the ability to pass legislation Clinton abused the ATF enforcement powers, prompting congress to hamstring them. Blame the fight for the accountability issues you see.

This has been a long fight, starting before the 1930s, you may not want to restrict gun ownership but history has already proven that others do, which brings us to the currently popular ""reasonable"" gun control efforts you mention.

Currently, people straw purchase for others with intent, this is already a crime but when the gun turns up at a crime scene they say ""It was stolen a year ago"" and the state has to prove otherwise, the state hates having to prove stuff, so instead they want to make ownership a legal responsibility to constantly track a gun, failure to do so would be a felony, moving the burden of proof.
The goal is to make a precondition for criminal offense rather than have to prove mens rea, I oppose that simply because of that, mens rea is important and we are ignoring it too much lately.


>Again, I don't know what the answer is, but I really do think the main excuse used to not even have a realistic conversation about the issue is bullshit.

The answer is simple, if you want a restriction, prove you are being reasonable by removing something.
Because up til now it has been a simple ""more vs less"" gun control fight, more is better, less is worse, no matter what the restriction, no matter how unreasonable or infringing it might be.

So what can be removed?
Suppressors and short barreled rifles could be removed from the NFA list.
Restrictions on the supply of full autos could be lifted or reduced. (reducing their cost, but not other restrictions of ownership)
Federal concealed carry permits
Import restrictions are excessive IIRC.


and thats just off the top of my head.
When you start saying things like ""rifles of any kind are rarely used in crimes, why focus on assault rifles"" you will gain credibility.

What are you going to fix with guns? You can't outright ban them because it is unconstitutional. Many of the mass shootings are done by people that obtained there guns legally. A shotgun or a rifle used for hunting are just as fatal, if not more, that any assault weapon. 

Mass shootings are a symptom of societal problems and banning guns at any level does nothing to solve the cause of these shootings. As long as there are legal guns of any kind these shootings will continue to take place. Since we can't ban guns outright why should we waste money on trying and instead invest that money into solutions that will actually work on fixing the cause of these shootings.

5. Concealed carry permits shouldn’t be given to perpetrators of violent misdemeanors or individuals arrested for domestic violence. The NRA/non-NRA gun-owner split on these issues is 81 percent and 75 percent in favor of the violent misdemeanors provision and 78 percent/68 percent in favor of the domestic violence restriction.
The poll, which sampled 945 gun owners around the country and had a margin of error of +/- 3, also found broad support gun-owners for the principle that “support for 2nd Amendment rights goes hand-in-hand with keeping illegal guns out of the hands of criminals.” In fact, more NRA members (87 percent) supported the statement than non-NRA members (83 percent). One wonders if the views of its supporters will be heard at NRA headquarters, as the organization opposes laws that attempt to implement several of the positions that Luntz’ poll established gun-owners support.
