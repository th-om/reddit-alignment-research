cvp1jz5,1,t3_3nkgaa,Blarglephish,"University of Oregon alum. I attended a very liberal college campus in the NW in the mid to late 2000's, here are the issues that were most controversial for students at the time:

1. **Media, Free speech protections, and censorship**. This is continuously an issue on every college campus. On my campus, there was always a big issue about what should and should not be printed in student publications (ie, was it offensive, could it be considered 'hate speech', etc.). There was [a somewhat well-known incident](http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/05/25/oreilly-baselessly-claimed-university-of-oregon/135804) with one of our more aggressively leftist publications printing a cover that had the crucified Jesus with an erection on it's cover (a parody of the Danish Muslim political cartoons) and Bill O'Reilly attacked that publication on his show (Ironically, the editor of the conservative, libertarian publication, the Oregon Commentator, came to the leftist magazine's defense on that show).

2. **2nd Amendment**. Even on a very liberal campus, Oregon still had quite a surprising number of gun-owners and libertarians who raised the defense of gun rights.

3. **GMO / Food safety**.

4. **Sexual Assault / Campus safety**. This one was another surprising one ... seemingly, everyone was in agreement that rape is bad, we should do something about it; However, all of the solutions that were being discussed on campus usually involved implicit blame or responsibility by men, who didn't like the idea of being assumed a rapist until proven otherwise.

These were all of the big ones I remember. LGBT groups were constantly fighting against things, but they had almost universal support (nobody had reason to align against them).

There are definitely censorship aspects merely for the fact that expecting criticism, sanction or shaming makes you less likely to make a statement or take an action. We see this clearly on reddit.

Zero credible threats have been found by the FBI regarding complaints of those crimes.

Certain types of threats are actual crimes already and are taken seriously. Hence the FBI involvement. 

To bring it back to your comment:

>I'm not even a fan of Sarkeesian, but I find it pretty strange that she is always the first person brought up in these sorts of discussions

What I find pretty strange is her insistence on institutional protection from things that have yielded zero arrests or credible threat assessment by federal investigators. 

She is brought up along side this discussion because it is a perfect example of double speak. We must believe that these things happened despite no evidence that they did. Social media companies and authorities shouldn't wait for evidence, they should take action based on if a person FEELS harassed. 

She is also a perpetual motion machine. Despite being a huge hypocrite, she somehow grabs funding from entities trying to focus on diversity.

While I wouldn't call that an oppressive campaign, I still don't really like the idea of people putting so much energy into something as trivial as altering the common vocabulary. It just seems inherently devious to me. I think prohibiting ceratain words only serves to force people to behave dishonestly, which is unhealthy for the psyche. It causes people to act out in other ways. In addition, the power of these words is only enhanced by suppressing them. If getting called ""bad"" things was commonplace, people would recognize the ultimately limited power of language, and realize the generally mild feelings which accompany hateful language. What I mean is that the most offensive language is often rooted in significantly less intense feelings which are exaggerated for effect, and fun, among other things. 

>However, as you have demonstrated with your own staunch opposition, it is not the same as actual censorship because no one can force you to be PC.

Again, I believe there is such a thing as censorship, outside of the legal definition and any way you slice it, the movement is pro-censorship. I will also add that I'm benefited by having absolutely no public profile whatsoever. The media can't turn the masses against me because the masses don't know me. But I would say that anybody with a notable amount of fame is pretty much forced to say only the things this movement has given their approval. 

In general you're right though, as long as the discussion is being had it's a good thing. There are probably legitimate situations where language is best kept somewhat limited, but the current response to it is absolutely atrocious.
