The droughts are cyclical in nature (they will always return in the future) and it is predicted that the effects of global climate change will make droughts in the future worse and they will occur more often.



San Diego is currently spending $1 billion to build a desalination plant so that its residents have enough fresh water and two other such plants are currently in the works around the state.

Isn't it obvious that California has reached its human population limit?

Democrats: considering all of these facts, why do you still support increasing the state's human population via immigration (vs. slowing immigration).  If it weren't for the current immigration levels, the state's human population would actually be declining.
