3lbedq,Why didn't any candidate go after Jake Tapper for terrible questions last night?,26,Honest_Discussion,"In **3 HOURS** last night, Jake Tapper couldn't find time to ask questions about Education, Student Loan Debt, Health Care, or *today's* Fed decision on interest rates. The economy overall was largely ignored

Forgive me, but I find these topics a little more relevant to my life than who said what about who, marijuana leagalization, or even Planned Parenthood. 

Why didn't one of the candidates take Tapper to task for essentially trying to constantly start a food fight with middle school questions? I feel that not only was it the right thing to do but it would've gotten TONS of applause.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lbedq/why_didnt_any_candidate_go_after_jake_tapper_for/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442505944,1444727404
