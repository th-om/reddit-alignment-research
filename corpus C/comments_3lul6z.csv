I couldn't figure out his position. That's kind of my point. He was all over the place whenever he talked, trying to pander to whoever he was talking to at the time. It's like he would say one thing, and then if that didn't go over well in the press, he'd completely flip the other way hoping to pander to the masses. I still don' 

In hindsight, it kind of makes sense. He had a faltering campaign and was doing anything he could to try to say relevant. If he said A and that didn't work to bump his poll numbers, he followed it up by saying B hoping that would work instead. It turned out, none of it worked for him and he's out.
