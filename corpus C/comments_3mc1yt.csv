To own a NFA item, you have to do these things:
Get a LEO to sign off on the paperwork.
Get fingerprinted.
pay a $200 tax stamp to the NFA.
wait 6 months for the NFA to process your background check.
Allow the ATF to show up at any time to inspect your NFA weapon.
and probably a few more things that I forgot. This is the only firearms regestry that is in america, and I honestly don't mind it.

The thing that sucks about the NFA setup though, is that short barreled rifles (IE any gun with a stock and a barrel less than 16in with an overall length less than 23in I think) are included, along with suppressors or putting a vertical grip on a pistol. These things need to be removed from the NFA because we have pistols, so who cares how long or short a rifle is, and most other nations suggest the use of suppressors as the safety devices they are, hell most other nations, you can buy one at the gunstore with no paperwork at all.


>Civilian arms have caught up or surpased it several areas. 

Civilian arms are always ahead of military small arms.

The only thing the AR15s don't have is automatic fire.

Federalist paper #29

What plan for the regulation of the militia may be pursued by the national government is impossible to be foreseen...The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious if it were capable of being carried into execution... Little more can reasonably be aimed at with the respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.

Alexander Hamilton Federalist paper #28

If the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no recourse left but in the exertion of that original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government, and which against the usurpations of the national rulers may be exerted with infinitely better prospect of success than against those of the rulers of an individual State. In a single State, if the persons intrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource; except in their courage and despair.

The people, without exaggeration, may be said to be entirely the masters of their own fate. Power being almost always the rival of power, the general government will at all times stand ready to check the usurpations of the state governments, and thesewill have the same disposition towards the general government. The people by throwing themselves into either scale, will infallibly make it preponderate. If their rights are invaded by either, they can make use of the other as the instrument of redress. How wise will it be in them by cherishing the union to preserve to themselves an advantage which can never be too highly prized!

When will the time arrive that the federal government can raise and maintain an army capable of erecting a despotism over the great body of the people of an immense empire, who are in a situation, through the medium of their State governments, to take measures for their own defense, with all the celerity, regularity, and system of independent nations? The apprehension may be considered as a disease, for which there can be found no cure in the resources of argument and reasoning.

original proposed draft  of  the right to keep and bear arms  of the  BILL of RIGHTS  (17 TH of 20 amendments) on
display at the Karpeles Manuscript Library  Santa Ana, California:

""That the people have a right to keep and bear arms; that a well regulated Militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the proper, natural and safe defense of a free State. That standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided as far as the circumstances and protection of the community will admit; and that in all cases
the military should be under strict subordination to and governed by the civil power.""

Feb. 20, 1788, while the states were considering ratification of the Constitution, Tench Coxe wrote:

Who are the militia? are they not ourselves. Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom.

Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American...The unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.

The logical contextual reading here is that the founding fathers thought of the relationship between the federal government and the state governments on analogy to the relationship between the British crown and the state governments, and wanted to make sure that the  possibility of organizing a revolt would continue to exist against the federal government, _ad extremis._ Thus, 'militia.'

What this _doesn't_ establish is that _individuals_ need to be able to revolt against the federal government. Indeed, it might well have been the case that what they had in mind was a state or county-level armory to which citizens had access, not private possession per se. 

I'd be interested to see evidence against this interpretation. Scalia dealt with it in _Heller_ but his reasoning to me seems extremely contorted and involves a great deal of cherry-picking. This issue is also where the split in the court is. ",1,0,1443194670,1444723762

cve2qim,0,t1_cve2adh,redwhiskeredbubul,"> Also why is that militia part irrelevant when it says in the next part ""the people"" instead of a person.

Scalia dealt with this in Heller but his reasoning is not especially convincing. Namely:

>“Right of the People.” The first salient feature of the operative clause is that it codifies a “right of the people.” The unamended Constitution and the Bill of Rights use the phrase “right of the people” two other times, in the First Amendment ’s Assembly-and-Petition Clause and in the Fourth Amendment ’s Search-and-Seizure Clause. The Ninth Amendment uses very similar terminology (“The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people”). All three of these instances unambiguously refer to individual rights, not “collective” rights, or rights that may be exercised only through participation in some corporate body.5

>Three provisions of the Constitution refer to “the people” in a context other than “rights”—the famous preamble (“We the people”), §2 of Article I (providing that “the people” will choose members of the House), and the Tenth Amendment (providing that those powers not given the Federal Government remain with “the States” or “the people”). Those provisions arguably refer to “the people” acting collectively—but they deal with the exercise or reservation of powers, not rights. Nowhere else in the Constitution does a “right” attributed to “the people” refer to anything other than an individual right.6

>What is more, in all six other provisions of the Constitution that mention “the people,” the term unambiguously refers to all members of the political community, not an unspecified subset. As we said in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S. 259, 265 (1990) :

>“ ‘[T]he people’ seems to have been a term of art employed in select parts of the Constitution… . [Its uses] sugges[t] that ‘the people’ protected by the Fourth Amendment , and by the First and Second Amendment s, and to whom rights and powers are reserved in the Ninth and Tenth Amendment s, refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community.”

>This contrasts markedly with the phrase “the militia” in the prefatory clause. As we will describe below, the “militia” in colonial America consisted of a subset of “the people”—those who were male, able bodied, and within a certain age range. Reading the Second Amendment as protecting only the right to “keep and bear Arms” in an organized militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause’s description of the holder of that right as “the people.” 

It's not that easy to see based on the limited number of occurences of the term why 'the people' _couldn't_ refer to a collective right in this case, apart from a mere resort to the gambler's fallacy. And the last point is especially weak historically: the founding fathers  _did in fact_ restrict the suffrage to men, with a particular property qualification: there is even a historical precendent in terms of how those two notions were related in terms of the idea of the citizen-soldier (that citizenship rights were a consequence of having military duties). The distinction between an individual and collective right is simply not that clear in the Constitution or the major supporting documents, probably because it's largely a 19th century notion.
