He certainly does work with Republicans on some issues, such as gun control, and on other issues I'm glad he doesn't compromise.  We could use a couple dozen more Senators just like him.",1,0,1442674875,1444726924

Agreed, to an extent.  Why are you so sure Sanders wouldn't compromise as President?  His role as Senator and his positions on the issues he strongly believes in simply don't support compromise.  This in now way means that he would refuse to compromise in a different role.
