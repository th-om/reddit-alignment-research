cv2vxzm,1,t3_3l3k8s,zoidberg1339,"Obviously the whole of the GOP would fight him tooth and nail. More importantly, he'd get pushback from a lot of more centrist Democrats, particularly those from more conservative states. Nobody in Congress - regardless of party - from a more rural district would want to be seen as being too buddy-buddy with a President Sanders.

Furthermore, I would expect a 2018 election (after a Sanders victory in '16) to go terribly for Democrats. If Sanders get elected next year I'm sure the Congress of 2017-'18 would be much bluer than our current body, but I imagine a 2010-style GOP wave would wipe those gains out (and then some) by 2019.",10,0,1442357353,1444728106
cv301qb,1,t3_3l3k8s,houinator,"Assuming Sanders wins a general election, there is enough of a leftward shift in this country that it is not hard to imagine the Democrats winning the Senate, and at the very least making a substantial dent in the Republican control of the House.  Add in a few moderate Republicans who are willing to cross party lines so long as it funnels some pork to their districts, the virtual extinction of the Blue Dog Democrats, and Sanders has probably slightly more political capital than for a progressive agenda than President Obama did in his first two years.  So one, maybe two, Obamacare sized reforms?",8,0,1442364558,1444728106

He has alienated to many people and put no effort into building a political network.  He spends to much time on HuffPo and not enough time building alliances on the Hill.  And he is to ""holier than though"" to horse trade.

He also is one of those people who doesn't just need you to do the right thing, but also needs you to do it *for the right reason*.  He's incapable of arguing something from a different point of view and thus can't adjust his arguments to different audiences.  He makes things about ideology unnecessarily and even when doing so inhibits progress.

Even if he brought a landslide of dems with him his history on the hill shows he doesn't even play well with other dems.  /shrug.

cv3hp41,0,t1_cv37rrs,righthandoftyr,"I don't think Sanders is actually running to win.  He's just running to tout his ideology on a national stage in the hopes of shifting the Democrats to the left and purifying it of the Blue Dogs.  So of course he talks about ideology more than policy, and doesn't make the deals it would take to actually make the policies feasible, because he's not trying to win the election or actually get any of it passed, he's just trying to force everyone else to court the progressive vote.",2,0,1442413207,1444728106

His administration can use that tide to get things done, implement election reform, and clean house.

Honestly, if the only thing Sanders ever accomplishes is election reform (i.e. getting money out of politics), then he will have single-handedly saved this country.",4,0,1442365822,1444728106

2020 is a census year and a presidential election year which brings out all the voters.  The winner of this election could decide not only the fate for the next 4 years, but also the next 16+ years.

The last time Democrats tried to do something drastic (Obamacare) was 2009 which ended up giving the Republicans control of 29 governors (+6) and several congressional districts allowing Republicans to pivot things in their favor for the past ten years.
