I do understand the importance of protecting people from the 'tyrany of the majority', or from any kind of tyrant, but I don't think this is the best way. The world changes fast, so a constitution which is extremely difficult to change can't really keep up with the changes in society.

To me, the parliamentary system (either with a constitutional monarch like we have, or an elected president subservient to the prime minister like Germany has) is far superior. If the prime minister becomes tyranical they can easily be removed by parliament using a simple majority vote. And in an extreme situation the monarch or president can intervene. It also means that the head of government and commander-in-chief are different people so coups are not really worthwhile.

I know many parliamentary countries also have a bill of rights. But in most cases they are more of an add-on, which might be *politically* impossible to change due to public opinion, but which *legally* can easily be changed due to the doctrine of parliamentary supremecy.
