>From the polls I have seen I would say that the general public does support the concept of marriage as a constitutional right. 

I agree, but that's not the same as processing it as a personal freedom issue for the purposes of public opinion. As an analogy, suppose we polled people on:

- Favor/oppose constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion
- Importance of religion
- A general mix of other personal freedom issues (free speech issues, gun ownership, drugs, gambling, alcohol, prostitution, etc)

I would bet (in fact, let's bet, I have some data and can actually test this) that whether or not one believes in ""abortion as a right"" has nothing to do with their general support for greater personal freedom under law, and *everything* to do with whether they think Jesus died for their sins.",2,0,1441814071,1444731380
cuvq52h,0,t1_cuvoz7y,fracto73,"This data, other than the support for gay marriage data, is not terribly relevant. The current Gallup data (about a month before the supreme court ruling) shows 60% in favor of marriage equality and 37% opposed. I would call that the general public supporting the right.

The personal freedom index is by design far too broad to try to use it to identify a particular item. It is intended to give a high level view of freedom for the average person to live as they like, to that end it weights topics based on how many are effected and how significant this group feels an item is. 

Here is what they say about how they weigh Marriage:

> ...At the next level we have asset forfeiture rules, marriage
and civil union laws, and arrests for “victimless
crimes,” each worth one-twelfth of the total...

>... However, we do not consider same-sex marriage to be a freedom concern either way. Instead, it seems to be a football
in the so-called “culture wars.”...

>... Our main variable in this category simply
indicates whether the state recognizes some form of
domestic partnership, civil union, or marriage for
same-sex couples (states do not get “extra points”
for moving up that scale)...

So they aren't even measuring for same sex marriage and that data is not helpful in analyzing this topic.

cuvqohj,0,t1_cuvq52h,ISBUchild,">The personal freedom index is ... intended to give a high level view of freedom for the average person to live as they like

That's the intended purpose of the personal freedom index, and why it is useful for comparison.

>So they aren't even measuring for same sex marriage

No, which is good, because I'm using it as a point of comparison alongside the separate gay marriage support. The idea being ""here's how states feel about gay marriage"" compared to ""here's where those states each stand on personal freedom issues generally"".

If gay marriage opinions were driven by preferences for freedom, we would expect support to be higher in states with more personal freedom generally. Instead, the correlation is exactly zero.

>I have no idea why the Romney data is there.

To provide an alternative explanation - if SSM doesn't vary with the freedom index, what does it correlate to? The answer is that it varies almost perfectly with Republican vote share, suggesting the issue is thought of as primarily left/right, and not authoritarian/libertarian.

>The current Gallup data shows 60% in favor of marriage equality and 37% opposed. I would call that the general public supporting the right.

It could be 90% national support, or 10%, but it wouldn't affect my position, which is on how that opinion is formed. I'm saying that the data not support the notion that the public forms their opinion on gay marriage based on their preference for freedom as such. Rather, the public follows the secular trend for the issue combined with their left-right affiliation, and then decides where they stand on SSM based on that. In this framing, libertarian language like ""rights"" is not driving the conversation, but is adopted as it is convenient. ""Rights"" aren't the process, they are the result, the tail being wagged by the dog of ideology.

----

The point of all of this being that trying to understand how the public feels about SSM requires letting go of such language as ""they're denying group X their rights."" Elite opinion talks about rights, equal protection, and all that noise, but mass opinion does not. The general public doesn't think of issues in terms of rights; They feel things and respond to social pressure. Thus, trying to convert people to the pro-SSM side of the issue by talking about rights is not very effective.",1,0,1441816674,1444731380

The most you can say is that there is no correlation between the freedom index's numbers and public opinion.

The whole point of using the index is that it doesn't. You've made this point like three times and I don't know how else to say this.

Your initial comment, in response to something I said regarding public opinion, was that this case was one of a ""government body ... enforcing a particular view of Christianity on the citizens it has authority over"" in contrast to ""allowing people the freedom to make choices"". The purpose of my comment was to say that this framing of the issue is probably not one that the general public shares.

As for the law, while state and local agencies are not obligated to enforce Federal prohibitions, I'm not sure states can explicitly legalize a crime, create a regulatory framework for the activity, and collect excise taxes from the prohibited activity they approved of.

For the purpose of how the public processes these issues, I think there's little difference between local defiance of marijuana and marriage particulars. I think maybe 5% of people outside this forum know or care that there is a difference.

For my own opinion, there's relaxed enforcement, and then there's conduct that totally contradicts the law as written. I think it's dangerous that the laws we are subject to is dependent on the fragile political equilibrium that exists at a certain time, with different entities agreeing to keep some distance while nothing on the books changes. This introduces dangerous *regime uncertainty*, which is very harmful to economic activity.

The process of law enforcement will always require prioritization and discretion, but for the executive branch to make a blanket and public statement that ""we aren't enforcing X; Enjoy yourselves"" would seem to suck the life out of the legislative branch.

cuvo61x,0,t1_cuvklur,shanedoth,"Well, every law applies to certain people or entities. And every law either requires someone to do something (an affirmative duty) or requires someone to refrain from doing something (a prohibition). And finally, every law will charge certain government officials with enforcing that law.

So with any law, you can ask:

* Who is subject to this law?
* Does this law impose an affirmative obligation or a negative prohibition?
* Who must enforce this law, and who may enforce this law?

And obviously it gets layered in with multiple laws each contributing to the overall legal context.

So applied to Kim Davis, we have a few issues to resolve. The Fourteenth Amendment specifically applies to all states and local governments, as well as their officials. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that any government entity granting opposite sex marriage licenses must also grant same sex marriage licenses (per the Supreme Court's *Obergefell* opinion). Kentucky law requires county clerks' offices to issue marriage licenses to anyone who qualifies. Therefore, Kim Davis is required, through a combination of state and federal law, to allow her office to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples (even if it's unclear whether she needs to personally issue them). Her deputy clerks are willing to issue the licenses, but she is not willing to allow them.

Contrast that to sanctuary cities or marijuana policy. Federal immigration law prohibits aliens who have no valid visa or permanent residency from being present in the United States. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is charged with the duty to enforce this law. Marijuana prohibition is enforced by the DEA, FBI, Customs, etc. Local and state officials are permitted to enforce these laws, if they want to. But they're not required to, under *Printz v. United States*, a Supreme Court case that said the feds can't force state executive branch officials to enforce federal statutes (that case was about local sheriffs refusing to enforce federal gun laws). So state officials can decide whether they want to enforce federal laws or not against private individuals.

But note the difference between refusing to enforce a law applicable to private citizens and refusing to follow a law applicable to oneself. Only one of these is illegal.

TL;DR: the Fourteenth Amendment requires state and local officials to carry out their official duties in a particular way, but federal drug law and immigration law (and gun law and environmental law and employment safety law and telecom law) do *not* require any enforcement duties from state and local officials.",10,0,1441812851,1444731380

the liberty promised by the Fourteenth Amendment is
derived, too, from that Amendment’s guarantee of the

Also, it's my assertion that if her position is allowed to stand (vis a vis 'free exercise' in relation to the fulfillment of the terms of her public office), it would present a violation of the 1st amendment 'establishment' clause. Effectively, 'establishing' the Christian religious doctrine as being the 'ruling' determination of government operations for the county clerk's office. Not to mention that if the entirety of that office operated as such (and there are 57 other county clerks offices in Kentucky that basically sided with her), it would mean that 58 county clerks offices in Kentucky would operate that way...and approx. 112 that would not. 


In my interactions with, and readings of, her supporters...it's pretty clear that they have a fundamentally different understanding of SCOTUS's function. They somehow believe that SCOTUS has ""made law"" here via their ruling. They also tend to deflect to a lot to other unrelated issues (Gavin Newsome's issuance of licenses to SSC prior to being told to cease and desist, the illegal immigration 'sactuary city' policy, Eric Holder's enforcement priorities vis a vis illegal immigration and other false equivalencies).


A considerable number of them have a paranoid, evangelical 'Christian caliphate' persecution complex and seem monumentally undereducated or informed as to how our constitutional form of government actually operates. They **burn** to have the US operate as a theocracy. I have had to point out to *many* that  Congress did, indeed, make a law regarding this matter. 


It was called ""DOMA"" (Defense Of Marriage Act). In fact, Congress passed the DOMA (Defense Of Marriage Act) law stating that marriage was to be defined as ""1 man, 1 woman"" (in section 3). Here's the info on that law and cases pertaining to its application and constitutionality:


> *""The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) (Pub.L. 104–199, 110 Stat. 2419, enacted September 21, 1996, 1 U.S.C. § 7 and 28 U.S.C. § 1738C) is a United States federal law that, prior to being ruled unconstitutional, defined marriage for federal purposes as the union of one man and one woman, and allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages granted under the laws of other states. Until Section 3 of the Act was struck down in 2013 (United States v. Windsor)""*

Section 3 of DOMA was what defined ""marriage"" as being between 1 man and 1 woman, which was challenged in SCOTUS:

> *""United States v. Windsor (2010–2013). Section 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirms that ruling, as does the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. government began implementing the decision the same week.[216]""* This is the case that ruled that portion of DOMA (as 1 man and 1 woman) being unconstitutional.


As to the most recent ruling in June:

> *""Obergefell v. Hodges (2013-2015) U.S. Supreme Court case finding state bans on same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. (Overturned Baker v. Nelson)""*

>But judicial review is not just made up.  In recent years, scholars have argued persuasively that the Framers expected judicial review of the Constitution.  But, even more importantly, judicial review has a strong basis in the constitutional text.  While I cannot go review all of the arguments, I will try to hit the high points.

>First, the Supremacy Clause expressly states that a form of judicial review exists:

- *This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.*

>Clearly, this is stating that state court judges must apply the Constitution rather than state statutes.  Thus, Graglia’s apparent claim that judicial review is not expressly in the Constitution is mistaken as to judicial review of state laws, and Graglia’s essay clearly indicates that he has such judicial review of state laws in mind.

Not in those words. However, the constitution does recognize that you can not be deprived of liberty without due process of the law. Now define liberty.

In relation to marriage as a matter of ""liberty"" (or pursuit of happiness):

There was no ""right"" that was abrogated via findings regarding marriage (being 1 man, 1 woman). 1 man and 1 woman can *still* get married. Nothing was 'done away with' here in any of the recent SSC/marriage related cases. The only argument that some have against it is based on moral/religious grounds. And as the old adage goes, it's basically useless to attempt to 'legislate morality'. Since we don't live in a theocracy, any religious argument used to assert whether or not group is allowed to marry (1 man/1woman) and a different configuration does not (1 man/1man or 1woman/1woman) will fail. Historically, the SCOTUS rarely revisits such 'hot button' issues, especially after it's already ruled on the matter in a number of cases...and has always confirmed that 14th amendment equal protections are a 'thing'.

This is factually inaccurate on a lot of counts. The supreme court does not always have to wait for cases to go through the lower courts. Jurisdiction is way more complicated than that. They don't have original jurisdiction in many cases, but they do in some. Even if they did have to wait on lower courts, that wouldn't do anything to respond to the claim that they get the last word.

This is self explanatory. If you had the freedom to marry who you love, is that more liberty or less liberty?  It isn't about the number of people married it is about having the ability to marry who you want. If I said you couldn't marry people of another race, you would have less liberty.

I wonder if you read SCOTUS cases. Reasonable people can disagree on the exact reasoning, but there is clearly more to it than them creating law out of whole cloth. You can make an argument that convinces 5 of the 9 smartest judges in the US that there is a constitutional right to same sex marriage.

Yes, the Andrew Jackson affair was a low point for the rule of law in this country.

Not at all.  In fact, the only issue I have with the gay marriage ruling is that it is setting law outside of the Constitutional controls.  No law was passed in Kentucky or Nationally to allow gays to marry.  Instead, the SCOTUS set the law, just as they did with Roe V Wade.  You want to find the political body responsible for this mess, look no further than the SCOTUS.  They're not supposed to establish law, but that's exactly what they've been doing.

This just shows me that you actually don't know how American constitutional law functions at all.

Yes, Congress can make constitutional arguments or judgments when considering a bill. However, these determinations of constitutionality are not binding (certainly not in the court). The same is true of the President.

No, instead, for over 200 years, we have operated under the system of judicial review, in which the judiciary (and namely the U.S. Supreme Court) is the final arbiter of what is and is not constitutional, able to override the conclusions of Congress and the President on such matters. It is the check on the powers of Congress and the President, and has been that way since *Marbury v. Madison*. Now, you can debate whether that's how the system *should* operate, but there is no doubt that that's how it *does* operate.

And yes, sometimes the Court gets it wrong, which can remedied by either constitutional amendment or later judgment from the Court that overruled that past decision (usually much later under a different Court). But until such time, that decision is the law.

So regardless of her opinion on the matter, Davis, as an elected public official who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution (which implies upholding the judgments of the SCOTUS on the meaning of the Constitution), had a **duty** to either comply with the determination from *Obergfell* or resign from her position.

If a local elected official refuses to authorize something that by law they are supposed to authorize, then the recourse in our system is impeachment by the state legislature.

So that's not really a big deal. The bigger deal is: what if the legislature refuses to impeach?

Basically, there's no real precedent or process in place here. The State constitution gives HER the authority to issue these. She is required to do so, but still there is no provision for anyone else issuing them if she refuses, no such authority exists to issue them in her place (the process in such cases is supposed to be: impeach the official and replace her with someone who will follow the law).

But specters of deeper fissures are already raised by the judge seeming to unilaterally give the deputies the authority to issue in her stead.

Who gave him the power to do that? A federal judge can't unilaterally create local officials authorized to issue marriage licenses. If anything, he should've ordered the legislature to meet to address this.

But what if they don't?

This is where things get scary.  There is literally no procedure for forcing a state governments to do something positive. You could stop them from doing something. But how does the federal government coerce a positive act of state-level authority?

It can't. There's nothing in the Constitution like that. To address that the federal government would be effectively issuing licenses on *its own* (ie, federal) authority.

But that's never been done before either. There's no precedent or provision for something like Federal Marriage.

In a way, that judge refusing to grant the divorce was right when he said the ruling effectively means marriage must now be in federal rather than state jurisdiction if you follow it to its logical conclusion. 

Because there is literally no way (practically or constitutionally) to force a state to confer its authority on a positive act. You could *void* something they tried to give authority to, you could strike down a law they *did* try to pass...but the federal government can't force a state legislature to pass a certain law or impeach someone etc, there is no mechanism in our federalism for coercing a *positive* act of governance.

What, does the federal government imprison every state legislator who won't vote for it? That seems like a constitutional crisis.

I suppose you could levy heavy fines against the State itself until it passed measures fulfilling the federal court's notion of giving equal justice (but that raises even more questions; even if the Feds confiscate the money. Like how the state can be expected to govern without funds).

To legislate against the moral codes of one’s fellows is a very grave act, requiring for its justification the most indubitable and universally admitted of social gains, for it is to steal their moral codes, to suppress their characters.""*

But what about Democrats who openly oppose immigration and drug laws?

I don't support Kim Davis but I think the recent grandstanding from Democrats on the importance of following the law is more about slamming Republicans who support Davis then it is about actually supporting laws.  I believe DADT is still officially law despite the Pres. Obama's decision to no longer enforce that.  I support his decision and believe it should be formally be stricken down but I don't see too many Democrats falling over themselves to keep gays from serving openly. ",0,0,1441822014,1444731408

The Supreme Court ruled in *Printz v. United States* that local and state governments *are not* required to enforce federal statutes such as drug law, or immigration policy. The court ruled in *Obergefell v. Hodges* that state & local governments *are* required to issue marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples.

I don't think so.

All this does is further reinforce the idea that the Republican Party is the political party of bigots and alienate everyone who isn't a rich, white, Christian, male.  

Davis should still be behind bars but at the very least her actions and the support her actions of garnered will keep Republicans from winning national offices.  Our generation is coming into its own and we've made it clear we don't support the Republican message of hate.  Their time was the 1800s and they're going the way of the dinosaurs.
