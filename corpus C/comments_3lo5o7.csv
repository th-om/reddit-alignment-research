>I support the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the Syrian National Council (SNC), the Kurdish Peshmerga, and other moderate rebels in the Syrian Civil War. I see President Assad as a war criminal who has lost almost all legitimacy to rule. That doesn't mean I feel that Daesh (commonly known as ""ISIS""), the al-Nusra Front, or other Salafist groups should take power in his place. I don't want anyone killing innocent people, no matter who they are or what they believe. To me, this is not an extreme or irrational point of view.

Do you know the name of any moderate groups off the top of your head? Do you know the names of the leaders? Do you understand the demographics of these groups, and can you name concrete political goals and policies these groups want to implement? If you dont, I highly suggest researching on your own. Many people just hear these names and support them based on the actors they are suppose to play in the Western narrative - ""FSA is the knight in shining armor batting the evil forces of Assad."" 

>I honestly feel like the overwhelming majority of people view the war as a monolithic fight between secularists and Islamic extremists, with Assad representing ""the lesser of two evils"" against a hodgepodge of foreign-backed terrorist organizations. I want to see Syria rebuilt as a free, democratic nation-state.

I want to see a Syria that isn't controlled solely by adherents to the Baathist Party and the families that are in the center of power. Unfortunately, I don't see an alternative. Relating to my previous questions, if you could supply me with information on the things I asked it would be great to read. As it stands, the only organized Center of government comes from the Baathist party. Some thing the overthrow of one system will lead to a new system. Me, I think there is a better chance for the current system to evolve into democratic traditions, which, is not impossible. 

Should Assad go? Maybe, but he can't just go for there to be changes. The security apparateus needs to be dismantled along with him. Since I don't see any viable alternatives being espoused by the opposition, I am wary. Libya is a perfect example of what happens when the system is violently overthrown. ",7,0,1442763497,1444726354
cv85zql,0,t1_cv7xpst,Ostridge93,"Okay, I'll address your questions individually:

1) *Do you know the name of any moderate groups off the top of your head?* - Aside from the Free Syrian Army, the Syrian National Council, and the Kurdish Peshmerga? No, I can't say that I do. There aren't actually very many well-organized rebel groups of any sort in Syria, just the overarching ones.

2) *Do you know the names of the leaders?* - The only one I can name off the top of my head is Riad al-Asaad of the FSA. It's been a while since I followed the Arab Spring religiously, so I'm not up to speed on each and every major figure representing the different participants of the conflict.

3) *Do you understand the demographics of these groups, and can you name concrete political goals and policies that these groups want to implement?* - The FSA was founded by defectors from the Syrian Army who wanted to take a stand against the atrocities of the ruling regime. The SNC and the FSA have both named freedom and democracy for all Syrians as their guiding principles. Nevertheless, those who are rising up against Assad are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims; the Alawi Shiites (the sect from which Assad and his family originate) are scared of what would happen in the event of a revolution. They are under the notion that their lives would be in serious danger were Assad to lose power - and if Daesh or al-Nusra took power, then they'd have a damn good reason to be afraid. It's not as if the FSA has no blood on its hands, but the problem there is that it is not as heavily coordinated as its adversaries, which means that any war crimes attributed to them are probably not being ordered by the FSA commanders themselves.

I acknowledge that my optimism is not firmly rooted in reality. The Assad regime and its supporters have used cluster bombs, barrel bombs, chlorine gas, and other weapons designed to kill indiscriminately. The idea that such a regime can retain power after what it has done is unconscionable. On the other hand, Daesh would probably be much worse. What I'm really arguing against in my original post is this false dichotomy between secular dictatorship and a hardline theocracy. I truly believe that the average Syrian wants neither; they just want the same basic things that we all want.",3,0,1442776563,1444726358

I'll start with this point. If you have only followed the Civil War up to the point that you think Riad al-Assad is the leader of the FSA then I would advise reading up to the most recent developments. For me, I am disillusioned by the groups you mentioned because of having followed it week to week. I'm not sure if it would change your opinions but it will certainly highlight why others are not in support of these groups. 

For instance, journalist Robert Fisk has stated the existence of the Free Syrian Army as an actual operational armed group doesn't exist. Besides his credentials, I believe him because I am unable to recall watching any videos in the last 3 years where the traditional green and white three starred flag, the representation of the group, was used in a military video or any pictures of it flying over captured territory. Furthermore, the FSA is not lead by al-Assad anymore. 

>Noeimi was appointed to the position of Chief of Staff on 16 February 2014, taking over from Salim Idris.[1][3][4] His appointment was confirmed by the FSA on 8 March 2014.[5] Colonel Heitham Afeisi, a co-founder of the Syria Revolutionaries Front and the Commander of the Maarat al-Naaman Martyrs Brigade,[2] was appointed as Noeimi's deputy.[1]

>The United States has sidelined Noeimi's office, and American officials have called his title a ""business card"".[6]

So the US does not take the leader of the FSA seriously, which is telling to its importance. 

As for the Syrian National Council, it is managed by exiled Muslim Brotherhood members, whose stated goal was to support the opposition and the overthrow of Assad and the Baathist Party. 

The Kurdish Peshmegra are an anamoly, and they certainly have democratic aspirations, but its not related to a new Syria. The Kurdish people want their own state and primarily operate in Northern Iraq, as they have lost significant territory to ISIS, along with suffering setbacks due to Turkish attacks on their forces. 

>The Assad regime and its supporters have used cluster bombs, barrel bombs, chlorine gas, and other weapons designed to kill indiscriminately. The idea that such a regime can retain power after what it has done is unconscionable.

Stranger things have certainly happened in regards to the survival of regimes if we take a look at history, so its existence is not unimaginable to me. Whether or not it should continue to exist because of moral and ethical reasons is a topic for another discussion. Certainly there are people within Syria that continue to enjoy the safety and support of the Baathist leadership. Simply look at the millions who have fled into regime controlled areas. To some, the Syrian government is trying to defeat an enemy, terrorist, supported by Western countries who embed themselves into towns and villages and set up defensive positions in residential and commercial homes. From their perspective, civilian casualities are collateral damage in a war being waged against these ""terrorist."" The dropping of bombs indiscriminately is not so indiscriminate when you think about the manner by which the opposition fights. Do I think its right? No, its a pretty sad state of affairs to be honest. Do I understand it though? Yes, I do. ",2,0,1442835483,1444726362

cv8060n,1,t3_3lo5o7,Nonsanguinity,"Syria was never a free, democratic nation state.  It's history does not contain thinkers and philosophers who developed these *Western* ideas over centuries and then implemented them through a series of trials and errors.

Syria was Ottoman for four hundred years, and was a battleground of the Crusades and various empires prior to that time.  Then the French and British carved up the Ottomans and it had a torrid relationship with the French until the 40s, and the Soviets after that, and that pretty much gets you to the Assads.

I'm not saying that their history precludes them from becoming a free, democratic, modern nation-state, but you have to understand that simply imposing a foreign philosophy and structure of government on a people is not the same as that structure developing endemically over time.  We tried to impose this structure on Iraq, at the cost of billions of dollars and thousands of American lives (and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives) and it devolved into ISIS in less than a decade.

I get the feeling of needing to *do something* about the situation.  But we *did something* by arming Afghans against the Soviets and they became Al Qaeda.  We *did something* in Iraq against Saddam and we got ISIS.  Maybe it's time to let the people in those regions decide and work out for themselves how to best govern themselves, rather than simply being the next empire to try to impose our foreign ideas on their people.

I'm not saying it is.  But I'm saying that democracy is not like a lightswitch, it's the result of thousands of years of a people's philosophy and history.  And when you try to just superimpose that idea on a people who *don't* have that kind of history, then at the very least you need to take that into account.

Because tbh, that *is* the situation (barring Assad being ""the lesser of two evils""). FSA as a unified organization that fights for secular democracy, doesn't exist. What's left of FSA is basically the Southern Front (they're doing pretty good). ISIS and the Islamists are doing very good in terms of land gains, morale, etc. The Kurds are also doing pretty good. Most of the original FSA fighters are either dead, or have left the fight to move back home with their family. 

>I want to see Syria rebuilt as a free, democratic nation-state. 

No offense, but I think we should look at Syria much more realistically. The war is 4 years in, and doesn't show any signs of stopping^1. I see a few possible futures for Syria (for when the war ends, and also just some critical moments):

1. Assad wins. I honestly don't know how this would work, as there's no way the vast majority of people are just gonna lie down, and take that.

2. ISIS/Jabhat al-Nusra/Jaysh al-Fateh/whatever take over Damascus or something major like that, and then the conflict reaches some type of ""endgame"". I don't even wanna think about this.

3. Assad steps down, and some type of peaceful agreement is brokered between the [former] regime and the opposition. This could work, possibly.

Did you notice how I didn't mention FSA in these 3 possibilities? That's because in all likelihood, they're not involved in the future of Syria. The Southern Front might take part in that hypothetical peace agreement (tbh, I don't really know anything about their ideology, just that they're doing well in the South), but idk. You're free to support FSA, but in my opinion, I don't think it's useful to support an abstract group that doesn't technically exist anymore. However, this entirely depends on what you consider Free Syrian Army mean. For me (and I think, most people), when I see the FSA flag, I just imagine the rebel groups that are secular/moderate Islamist. If that's what you support, then feel free. But don't try to delude yourself into thinking they're still entirely relevant. They had their role early on, but now other actors are more important.
