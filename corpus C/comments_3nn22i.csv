1.) The majority view in the Supreme Court shifted. The view that the second amendment pertains to some kind of local military or constable force and not privately owned firearms was pretty popular for a long time on the court and it's still the 4/9  minority view. The court tends to follow public opinion on the yes/no of complex cases but it has a huge influence on the kinds of arguments people make.   

2.) Ironically, some of it is also probably because of the aggregate effect of so much media emphasis on stranger crime. The majority of gun deaths aren't stranger crime, but that is heavily what's reported and those are the cases where using a gun in self-defense looks appealing. 

3.) A general shift in how people think about rights. It might seem odd that, for example, the two things with big movements in public opinion are same-sex marriage and gun control. But if you think about legal rights exclusively in terms of restraining government inteference, this makes complete sense. That's a big shift from the 1950's and 1960's when it was much more accepted that the government could enforce morality. ",5,0,1444089793,1444716757

The fact that there's no real attempt to provide better mental health care for troubled young men means the only thing more gun control would accomplish is make it harder for responsible people to acquire guns.

2) Gun control has been largely ineffective in stopping crime. Chicago has some of the harshest gun laws in the country and still has a huge gun violence problem. In their case the problem is cultural (gang culture born out of necessity) rather than just an issue of mental health. The guns are either acquired legally, taken from a family member, or acquired illegally. The last shooter had a hand gun and apparently no prior criminal or mental health history. 

3) Gun rights are now seen as individual rights. Much like freedom of speech and freedom of religion, the right to bear arms is seen as indispensable and any attempt to infringe upon it in any way (even for the ""greater good"") is seen as unamerican. 

4) Its seen as a political ploy by Democrats.

This assumes that either the effect of gun control on gun-related crime is literally zero (which is inherently unlikely) or that gun control increases crime, but that requires us to believe that crime has dropped for other reasons, which is entirely possible.   _However_, that fact in itself has no bearing on the efficacy of gun control one way or the other. Moreover, if crime has dropped, it's difficult to understand why their would also be a panic reaction to impose sweeping gun regulations. 

You _can_ argue that there is a moral panic reaction about guns every time there is a mass shooting and that the gun control measures that are instituted are irrational and piecemeal--I'm not sure I disagree with that. However, that fact in itself is irrelevant to the efficacy of gun control _in principle_, since it's the specific laws in that case which are bad.

1.)  Gun control laws proposed largely don't work or the gun control laws go to far.  Places that have practically attempted to ban guns, like D.C. and Chicago, aren't known for being safe places.  

When you put in place new laws, like we saw in New York and Connecticut after Sandy Hook, the laws made law abiding citizens criminals through legislation.  So, it's kind of a form of collective punishment for a class of people that never did anything wrong.  

Some gun control laws do work, we don't see any squabbling over the automatic weapons restrictions or the higher requirements for classes of heavy weaponry.  Its often the new laws being proposed that are designed to make it very difficult for someone to own a gun that are seen as the problem.  

2.)  Crime is dropping nationally, but it isn't uniform.  Detroit sees crime spike to levels that would put it #2 in homicides per capita if it were a nation.  In situations like Detroit, the police can't be relied upon to protect people and they should have the right to defend themselves.

3.)  We have too much gun control proposed that doesn't address any of the issues that are being cited usually.  We hear it constantly from the top levels of government ""We have too many guns""

That's not the same as saying we need background checks.  People do submit to background checks and they have wide support.  But when you have politicians blaming the mere presence of guns...well that makes their motives seem awfully fishy.  They don't want to take people's guns, but they say we have too many of them.  

Basically, people see gun ownership as an inherent right of an American citizen and people don't want to see those rights eroded and restricted due to fear mongering.  Few are happy about the lose of freedoms under the Patriot act.  Why should people be happy about the loss of other freedoms?

> 1.) Gun control laws proposed largely don't work or the gun control laws go to far. 

The problem is that these are two totally different kinds of questions and they need to be discussed separately. Whether or not gun control laws work is a _factual_ question. Whether or not they are justifiable in terms of rights is a _normative_ question. The degree to which a given law inconveniences you as a responsible gun owner has no bearing on how well it works in reducing crime. 

Moreover, the laws that exist to restrict gun ownership are not the only possible laws. Therefore, the question of whether a given set of laws actually does reduce crime is different from the question of whether _any_ such law can reduce crime. We can say that a series of such ineffective laws will exasperate gun owners, and they aren't wrong to be exasperated if the laws are in fact ineffective. However, this exasperation has no inherent bearing on the efficacy of gun control laws in general. 

Finally, the efficacy of given laws is often difficult to determine: it can be done, _but_ anecdotal bits of evidence about whether crime decreased in general or increased in one place, in themselves, do not constitute evidence of anything because there are _always_ cofounding factors.   

>So, it's kind of a form of collective punishment for a class of people that never did anything wrong. 

It's a balancing question between the rights of some people to own guns without inconvenience and the rights of other people not to get shot. We _do_ have an affirmative responsibility to adopt the gun control laws that will work. That has to be balanced with the inconvenience brought on people, but the moral calculus and the political calculus of those two things are different. It is _politically difficult_ to incovenience the majority for the physical welfare of the minority, especially when that minority is basically a statistical construct, but it still needs to be done--to show otherwise you need to give me an argument as to why those restrictions are particularly egregious. Hyperbole like 'they made law-abiding people into criminals' doesn't cut it, unless you can convince me that's _literally_ what they did. 

>But when you have politicians blaming the mere presence of guns...well that makes their motives seem awfully fishy. They don't want to take people's guns, but they say we have too many of them. 

The problem is that a lot of the research kind of _is_ oriented towards showing that guns pose an added statistical danger simply by being around. That's been demonstrated in a number of cases. The reason they're set up that way is because that's often how we discuss risk _in general_ in studies like this. Lead paint isn't dangerous unless you eat it, but there's a class of people who will eat lead paint in any case, so we treat lead paint as an inherent risk. We use that logic for all kinds of things, especially for medicine or for insurance. It's very easy to read sinister intentions into that when there's a question of rights, but the simple fact is that the research is oriented towards the observation that guns are inherently dangerous. 

It _doesn't_ therefore follow that the solution is 'ban all the guns,' but there are groups in society, like the AMA, that are ethically _obligated_ to a maximizing position on gun control because they're the ones who have to pull the bullets out of people when they get shot.

I agree they are separate questions.  That's what I'm saying.  I think most people can agree that banning flash suppressors doesn't do anything to reduce crime.  We can all mostly agree that limiting gun magazines to 7 rounds, which covers just about all handguns goes too far.  Those things get proposed together in a bill and they have multiple criticisms.  It's not a blanket opposition to gun control.  

The effort of gun control doesn't seem to be one to reduce crime.  The effort seems to be to reduce guns.  

>It's a balancing question between the rights of some people to own guns without inconvenience and the rights of other people not to get shot.

I'd say this is a false presentation.  We have the right to own guns from the 2nd Amendment, that's pretty clear.  Everyone has the right to not get shot because if you do get shot, that other person will by held liable and get tried and thrown in jail.  There's no idea out there that people can just go around shooting people.

>to show otherwise you need to give me an argument as to why those restrictions are particularly egregious.

Refer to the flash suppressor and 7 round limit in New York.  Every issue is separate.  

>Hyperbole like 'they made law-abiding people into criminals' doesn't cut it, unless you can convince me that's literally what they did.

That is actually what they did with their Assault Rifle registration requirement in Connecticut and New York.  Failure to register your gun and I think they also had inspection requirements too.  I'm not up on all the details, but not following the law is punishable 

""According to New York State Police, failure to register an assault weapon by the deadline is punishable as a misdemeanor ""and forfeiture of the weapon."" ""

>The problem is that a lot of the research kind of is oriented towards showing that guns pose an added statistical danger simply by being around. 

What isn't?  That would be true for knives too.  Is it a significant danger though?  Not really.  Plano, Texas has an extremely low homicide rate despite having an extremely high gun ownership rate.

>Lead paint isn't dangerous unless you eat it, but there's a class of people who will eat lead paint in any case, so we treat lead paint as an inherent risk.

Sure we do.  But there's no constitutional right to Lead Paint and there's no one really defending lead paint either.  

In the case of medicine and insurance...well those are probably perfect examples of how government rules and regulations may have made things *worse*.  Insurance is more expensive and less competitive, medicine shortages occur because of an extreme focus on safety.  There was a meningitis outbreak a few years ago that was caused by the government shutting down pharmaceutical manufacturers which pushed the manufacture of the drug to compounders.  Leading to a worse problem than occurred previously.

So, yes, it's a question of risk.  I'd say many gun owners recognize that.  When you look at the law proposals though, what risk reduction do you get?  Very little typically.  Instead you get what's really the focus...a gun reduction by banning classes of guns.

>but there are groups in society, like the AMA, that are ethically obligated to a maximizing position on gun control 

I don't think that's true at all.  What we've seen going on is the politicizing of previously non-partisan institutions.  The AMA, the CDC, and so on.  Which speaks directly to the idea that the government is overreaching.  No one is allowed to no longer care, all groups are being pulled into a government system and must speak on political issues. Especially, with groups like the AMA, it seems to be a problem because there was just a  huge industry kickback from Obamacare that benefits doctors.

That's actually not self-evident at all.

You're equivocating between the rationale for a right existing and its mechanism of enforcement. As far as peoples' rights to not get shot, the agency of the people who do the shooting is irrelevant because the government is still obligated to provide for their personal safety, regardless of whether or not there are bad people out there. It is unacceptably morally lax to say, 'welp,there are bad people out there, sorry we couldn't do more.'  

The relevant comparison is between the status of moral patienthood of gun owners who have to put up with restrictions, and moral patienthood of the people who die as a result of the availability of guns who would not have died otherwise.  

>That is actually what they did with their Assault Rifle registration requirement in Connecticut and New York. Failure to register your gun and I think they also had inspection requirements too. I'm not up on all the details, but not following the law is punishable

I don't think you understand how broad and important this research methodology is. Looking at associated risks is also how we do things like develop vaccines and discover the cause of diseases and control epidemics. A huge chunk of the research on Spanish Influenza, for example, was based on a total fuck-up--people thought it was caused by a bacterium that is associated with severe flu infections. _But that research was hugely important_ in figuring out that influenza is caused by a virus. It's possible (though it seems bizarrely improbable) that the correlation between guns and gun deaths is some false correlation--but we _still_ have to act on our best knowledge and try to regulate based on what we know. It is really dangerous to start undermining public trust in this process. 

>Instead you get what's really the focus...a gun reduction by banning classes of guns. 

But if the question is of the efficacy of gun reduction, versus some other, unknown better option, that doesn't give us much to work with. If you think gun control increases crime, fine, then show that.

They're _supposed_ to speak on political issues. That's called 'public engagement.' It's what you're doing right now. The whole CDC thing with banning research 'advocating gun control' is a perfect example. It is _one_ thing to manipulate data to support a conclusion.

It *is* an argument because the 2nd Amendment exists.  If you go too far, you deny people the right to bear arms.  It then speaks directly to the responsibility of the politicians and government.

The second amendment likewise does not contain its own justification: that's why the Constitution has a preamble.  

>How so? I'd think it's all about the people doing the shooting. Its already a crime to shoot someone.

The fact that we've criminalized something doesn't mean that the government has discharged its responsibilities on the matter. You can't adulterate bread with sawdust. But you also have to put ingredient lists on the food so that people know it doesn't have sawdust in it. Regulations like that perform important functions.

>Where does this obligation come from? How did you determine this and what is it's scope? I think you're confusing a typical function of government with a governmental obligation.  

Regulations aren't just cute things the government does out of a spirit of kindness. It does them to, as the preamble goes, Promote the General Welfare. The right not to get shot is pretty self-evident as a right--and the constitution explicitly says that rights not enumerated may still exist.

>I do not think gun control increases crime. I think criminals increase crime and gun control reduces non-criminals ability to protect themselves.

But this is an evasion. In principle gun control either increases crime or decreases it. Criminals assuredly increase crime, but other things may affect crime as well. Studying what increases crime is the object of the science of Criminology and related fields. Gun control may decrease the ability of people to protect themselves, but this needs to be weighed against the possible decrease in crime. And strictly speaking the issue with guns isn't just with crime, it's with violent death, since most gun deaths are suicides.  

>I agree, it is the perfect example. The CDC had no protocol in place to deal with Ebola. Failing in their primary role to get involved in political issues. Guns aren't a disease and are outside the CDC scope.

Sorry, it is not an evasion.  I just do not think the same way as you do.  That's why we have come to different conclusions.

Gun control isn't about crime.  It's about controlling guns.  It's right in the name.  If it was about reducing crime, then there would be little need to be talking about it.  Crime has been falling as gun ownership has gone up.  Statistics to support gun control never focus on the larger subject of crime.  The statistics are compartmentalized.  You only have to view Piers Morgan to know.  He'll compare ""Gun deaths"" in the UK vs the US.  He isn't comparing violent crime in the US vs the UK because while the UK has fewer gun deaths, they have more violent crime.

Most times, the people who do commit violent crimes ultimately get a slap on the wrist and most offenders become repeat offenders. The country is also realizing that there are bigger issues at hand like mental health issues. This is a plaque in our country and it must be addressed. 

I think people are smarter than the anti-gun agenda pushers seemed to realize. With the power of the internet, more and more are finding out the truth for themselves. They are learning history beyond the memes, researching the statistics beyond the facebook posts. 

However, I think there are several more factors in play. 

One is that the agenda is blatantly obvious and I think Americans are pretty fed up with being treated like toddlers. Whenever a ""great tragedy"" occurs, we can pretty much call when and what a politician will say before they do. It is like clockwork and people are starting to notice the trend. 

Something else is the overwhelming attention being drawn to our police forces. We can't deny that it is largely the left that pushes the ""cops are out of control agenda"" .... and then tries to say only the police should have guns. People aren't too kosher with this, at all. People are noticing a system that is ever encroaching, and they are doing as any living being would when they feel threatened - they push back. Another thing is that behind the media fiasco surrounding mass shootings (because these are the only shootings being propagated and we know it), is all the stories of those who saved lives with guns. Unless you are among the radical left, there is almost a story a day that is featured about kids, elderly and everyone in between defending themselves and others with firearms. This is something that always sits in the back of people's minds.. Do you really want to be defenseless in a crazy society? I don't. You could say that the second amendment is the last line of defense from those in power becoming too powerful. As those in power try to take more power, people will ""cling"" (no pun intended) to their defense mechanism. For Americans against what seems to be a government that is completely out of control, their ultimate defense is their guns. 

To put it more simply.. and without trying to be ""cliche..."" the country is waking up. People are unhappy with the way things are going and with a society more involved with politics than they have in a very long time, people are learning the truth about what is really going on.

We are the ones feeling the effects of what our lawmakers are doing.

Ah, well I can explain it pretty well.
Its like the abortion issue.

A bunch of well meaning people want to ban something because they feel its legality results in the death of innocents. The constitution bars such a ban, but they consider that a barrier to overcome rather than an actual right to respect. So they instead try to enact as much control as possible, lie cheat and steal to get more control, because people are dying and the ends justify the means.

Personally I disagree with both, I find those who actively work to make constitutional rights harder to access to be reprehensible. I think politicians who do this should be jailed for short symbolic sentences.",-2,0,1444132465,1444716801
