Likely not that much if at all.

> What will happen to all these people that do cross illegally?

The same thing that happens now, I would guess.

> Does Mexico decide to take care of them? Will the ""200 billion"" dollar expense transfer over to their government? Will there be unrest in Mexico?

Well, if they stayed in Mexico, than yeah. However, many of these people are from central American countries and Mexico might choose to try and deport them there. In any event, it would definitely be costly for Mexico.

> The supply for drugs will be affected, but the demand will stay the same. Will people end up using drugs less or will drug manufacturing in the U.S. become a big thing?

History and economics would suggest suppliers would pop up elsewhere, either in the US or other countries.

> The drug trade is hugely profitable to Mexico and other South American nations, there are literally gang wars over it, how will this affect those black market industries?

Well, the best possible outcome would be those organizations getting severely harmed and putting the Mexican government in a better position to curtail their activities.",5,0,1443033312,1444724892

cvbs3xm,1,t3_3m3i9k,kingvitaman,"Farm laborers are generally paid by the carton, or pound. Obviously that would be a practice that would be abandoned. It's also often cited why these people are such hard workers. Obviously this would be impossible to do legally. I've seen estimates as high as 12 dollars an hour for an American to do the same labor, and that's without the overtime that is now commonplace which would take it to what? 18 bucks an hour? People also forget that the ag industry is ridiculously competitive, and prices are now the bottom they possibly can be right now. Deporting millions, or cracking down on those who employ them, would be an unbelievably disastrous blow to many oter sectors of the economy. Why? Because there's no work force to replace them. There were attempts to try and pay 9 bucks an hour, and there were offers of free transport to the sites, and even housing stipends. The result? Nobody took the jobs. 

The whole nonsense about the wall is such a clear charade that's it's embarrassing and is a testament to how out of touch reality people like Trump ( if he even believes what he says ) are. 

The other elephant in the room of course is that a majority of new immigrants are coming from El Salvador and other central american countries. The idea we can drop them off in Mexico is laughable. Estimates are also around half a trillion dollars to deport them all. It's complete insantiy. Even Reagan saw it for the clusterfuck it is, and granted millions amnesty. There's just no other solution.",1,0,1443040405,1444724892
