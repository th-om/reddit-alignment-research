3lyix1,Who do you think will be the GOP final four?,51,ironpete,"I believe it will be  Carly Fiorina.  A hardnosed business person who made a good impression at the debate and might pull some ""I want to vote for a woman"" voters away from HRC. Just don't look to deep.

Marco Rubio. Another nice package. Young, good looking with a strong appeal to conservative and religious voters.

John Kasich. Most experienced politician out there and the possibility of bringing over Ohio to the red side.

Jeb! Money, name (still popular on the right) and a very good experienced team. May not do well in the polls but will be a contender with the delegates.
