cv5gn55,0,t1_cv4xtz4,C_L_I_C_K,"He doesn't have to run for president to get a Fox News contract. He dominated cable news ratings on the weekends. Fox News hates the fact that he left to run for president. That's why they, along with other mainstream media outlets, have been trying their best to ignore and marginalize him. 

He quit a multi-million dollar successful TV show to run for president. He also quit his radio show that was syndicated by over 500+ affiliates to run for president. He could still be living the good life without subjecting himself to moronic attacks by the likes of you in order to get book deals, TV show contracts, or radio show contracts. He's been there, done that. Maybe, just maybe, he wants to be president to save this fucked up country and isn't in it just for the fame or money. ",1,0,1442544631,1444727364

cv51995,1,t3_3lbiiy,slam7211,"He is a faction candidate. Historically the GOP is a three legged party.

Leg 1 is the fiscal conservatives

Leg 2 is the Neocons/Hawks

Leg 3 is the social conservatives/Religious Right.

Huckabee is running hoping to force his party to keep his leg of the party represented in the national conversation.

cv57g30,0,t1_cv51995,iliveintexas,"Who is left of the Neocons?

Trump, Fiorina, Paul, and Carson don't seem like neocons, with Paul at the far end.

Huckabee and Cruz seem to be the front-runners from last night's primetime debate. Jeb Bush has all of W's advisors, so there's good reason to suspect he's not much different from his brother. Marco Rubio has made several statements recently supporting neo-conservativism.

Where are Christie, Walker, and Kasich on neo-conservativism? Walker recently hired a neocon advisor. Christie seems like a neocon given how many references he makes to 9/11. 

Lindsey Graham and John McCain are definitely the true neocons, but both are irrelevant at this point.",1,0,1442528373,1444727376

cv5h066,1,t3_3lbiiy,C_L_I_C_K,"I know this subreddit is filled with liberals and wanna-be libertarians who hate Huckabee. Just FYI, he was tied for 3rd place in the most recent nation-wide poll:

Huckabee accomplished this even with mainstream news networks always marginalizing him and ignoring him, if not outright lying about him and bashing him every chance they get. Imagine if Huckabee had half the air time that Trump gets or half the love that Cruz gets from ""conservative"" talking head radio shills like Mark Levin, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham, etc. 

I know it's hard to believe, but there are still a lot of Huckabee supporters out there. You just won't find that many on the Internet, and definitely not here on Reddit, since it's mostly populated by brainwashed sheep who never do their own research and would rather have their minds made up for them. That's how we got 8 years of Bush Jr. and another 8 years of Obama. That's why this country and this world is now in the chaotic and messed up condition it's in.",0,0,1442545291,1444727376
