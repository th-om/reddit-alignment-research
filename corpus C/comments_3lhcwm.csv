cv7n2gp,1,t3_3lhcwm,Burn-Account,"I think people in my generation (i.e your target) are looking for an alternative to a system they view as failing.

A few months ago I went to a family gathering and remember a conversation between two of my uncles (both middle age white fuys) and a cousin (24) about how the economy wasn't so bad, and the cousin cutting in that it sure didn't look like that from where he stood.

And then a bit later they were catching up and talking about their kids (now grown), and I was struck by how few were employed in higher tier jobs. There was a waitress, a part-time journalist/part time medical secritary, a line cook, etc. I think of 6 of their kids, one had a job related to their education (one uncle is a college professor and the other is a doctor/professor on the side, all of these people had college degrees and we're educated). I think people my age are starting to see the current economic system as failing and start leaning towards other alternitives, sometimes with little knowledge of these alternitives.

There is also the issue of social conservitism. Slowly more and more people are seeing it as being radical and unacceptable, but I think this is a secondary issue to the first one I mentioned. Even if you look at the current presidential race, you can see that the level of social conservitism varies widely across the candidates. ",1,0,1442724962,1444726882

People on a political discussion forum should be expected to use and understand accurate classifications and concepts; the discussion had been had often enough now that people should realize that no politician is advocating a policy of actual socialism.

cv6n4uk,1,t3_3lhcwm,xiipaoc,"I have no idea why millennials or anyone else becomes libertarian.  Libertarianism is a really shitty way for a society to be organized; everyone gets rights and nobody gets responsibilities.  *But* if you believe in this, you're probably not going to be Republican because the Republican party has been taken over by religious crazy people.  Millennials these days have grown up with the internet and ease of civic education.  Any idiot can go online and find news from a variety of sources, opinions, etc.  It's much easier to challenge a worldview today than it has been in the past.  With all this access to information, as well as easy access to similar-thinking communities, it's not surprising that millennials are getting much more secular and are thinking and researching more about their political choices.  A lot of the positions of the Republican party are based on prejudice and bias, for example, so traditional conservatism is unappealing because young people realize this.  These positions are primarily the social views.  Take the social conservatism away from the Republicans, and what you have left is basically libertarianism.  That said, there's a lot of economics on the right that's also based on prejudice and bias for some people.  In the last few decades, for example, the image of the ""welfare queen"" has been used to rally the racist base to curtail welfare programs, since the people who benefit are stereotyped women of color who therefore don't deserve it.  Millennials are much less prejudiced than previous generations, and that's always going to be the case as formerly marginalized populations become more mainstream.

As for millennials becoming more socialist, I have no idea.  Is that actually happening?  The US has traditionally been a right-wing country, basically since its inception as the colony of refuge for the Puritans, the haven of free enterprise for wealthy landowners, and, of course, a great place to make money via the slave trade.  Our idea of ""freedom"" has always meant the freedom to oppress others.  In the Old World, people were oppressed.  They were tired of being oppressed.  So they came to the New World and they got the chance to be the oppressors for once.  Well, in the 20th century (and earlier too, of course), people started getting fed up with that shit.  They started demanding rights.  They banded together against their employers.  Eventually, they won, and they got health care, advantageous labor laws for workers as opposed to executives, free education, that sort of thing.  In Europe.  The US was always further right, so we never got any of that stuff.  The people in charge, the plutocrats, would stand to make less money if they paid workers fairly and gave them appropriate time off, paid for healthcare through their taxes, etc.  Wealth was distributed to the rich, and any sort of public program would redistribute it away to, you know, everyone else.  The 99%, in millennial parlance.  So, what did they do?  Well, this is socialism.  And there was a big socialist movement going on in the world, the USSR.  The USSR was an evil totalitarian regime, and therefore socialism was evil totalitarianism.  Of course, this fails any sort of laugh test, but that's how McCarthyism worked!  So the moneyed interests were basically able to keep people from getting too uppity by using the Socialist Soviet Union as the bogeyman (and they actually were the US's main adversary, so it was an easy comparison to make).  Well, millennials today don't equate socialism with the Soviet Union but instead to Europe, which we see as largely successful places that have all of the good things we want and yet still stand, especially the UK and Germany (Scandinavia is everyone's favorite example, but they have other issues going that make them not such a great comparison.)  Basically, we see that social progress has been made elsewhere, and we'd like to have that social progress made here too.

The thing is, this isn't new.  We've always had a vocal left wing of young people.  Bernie Sanders himself was one of them when *he* was a young person, protesting segregation and such.  What is new is that, with the internet, we can look around the world and see that other people in other countries have it better than us.  Our positions are *mainstream* left positions, and while not everyone on the left agrees with all of them, they're actually... pretty uncontroversial.  So I wouldn't say that there's some ""socialist"" movement that didn't exist before.  With Bernie Sanders identifying with this term, the term has just lost some of the potency it had due to its attachment to the actually evil USSR.  About 10 years ago, we would have just said ""progressive"".",-12,0,1442635949,1444726886
