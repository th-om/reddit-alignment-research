The Democrats positions on civil rights changed in the '60s, leapfrogging the Republican position of ""the government shouldn't consider race at all."" Their position on women made roughly the same leapfrog. But all the way through, they have supported greater government control and increased government spending.

I'm inclined to tell you to fuck yourself for making this tired stupid argument, but once again, pro lifers believe life begins at a different stage than pro abortion people. The constitution grants them the right to life in their eyes. It has nothing to do with woman. The woman doesn't even come into the equation.

Gay marriage. No other right is being withheld from gay people in America. I agree the party is wrong, so do 40% of other republicans. Huckabee and Cruz have 1% support in the party.

There are plenty of fine arguments for the pro abortion side, use one of those. Population growth, entitlement expenditures come to mind. 

>Secular realignments"" are the more gradual shift in voter bases.

This doesn't mean what you think it means. 

Realignment refers to changes in power, leaders, and core issues a party identifies with. It has nothing to do with the core philosophical beliefs one has about the role of government. 

You can certainly find examples throughout history of a party doing something seemingly contradictory to the larger philosophy.

Until rather recently, the parties have generally been more regional and factional, instead of grand blocs representing 'right' and 'left'.

Not really akin to today's progressivism, but enough to be considered so in the past. 

For decades, there was also the 'Old Right' wing, from the Midwest and North, mainly, who represented views more in line with modern Paleoconservativism. And who, by all means, also have lessened influence. The last one with any real traction was Barry Goldwater in '64. 

While their voices have been somewhat muted over the years, such Liberal Republicans still have a presence in the party, even though it has admittedly sifted towards the right. Albeit in a newer direction than past platforms. 

Now, in regards to women's rights, certainly the modern Democrats are more in line with modern views on the subject.
