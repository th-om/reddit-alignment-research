3k66of,Why don't liberals/democrats/progressives in blue states & cities have a desire for local control?,27,warrenfgerald,"It seems odd to me that a democrat living in someplace like San Francisco cares so much about progressive programs being administered at the federal level. Wouldn't they prefer to keep more of their tax dollars at home so they can implement these programs more effectively? Imagine if California kept the majority of their federal taxes at home. They could have the worlds cleanest and fastest high speed train in the world. They could eliminate carbon emissions, have the best schools, the best prisons, etc.... California could become a liberal utopia.

I have heard arguments that progressives care about all people, not just their neighbors, so they want these wonderful government programs to apply to all Americans. But this seems like a semantic argument based solely on nationality. Why would someone in California care more abut a child in Alabama than a child in El Salvador? Clearly liberals are not calling for social programs for third world countries so what difference does nationality make?

Another argument could be efficiency and economies of scale. A program like Social Security can be run more effectively at the national level than having 50 different retirement programs.   But as we have seen Social Security is becoming more and more vulnerable due to mismanagement and lack of long term foresight. The downside to a national retirement program like Social Security is there is no competition. It is a monopoly. If each state was competing with one another for residents, they could use great programs like state run social security, medicare, etc... to lure potential residents. There would be added incentives for states to run more effective programs. 

And lastly, we all spend a lot of time arguing (left vs right) about the role of government and weather a government program or service is necessary but we rarely ever debate what level of government should administer those services.
