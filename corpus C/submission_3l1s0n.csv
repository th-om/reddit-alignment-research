3l1s0n,Bernie Sanders Supporters: why do you so intently trust a politician that promises your the world?,36,zigmeister22,"Why do you so intently trust a politician that promises you the world? 

Have you not studied history?

edit:

I see so many starry-eyed Sanders voters that truly believe that Sanders' promises will happen if he is elected, and that we can pay for this massive increase in spending.

Politicians like Sanders are not new- just study history a little bit. They tend to draw in the young, naive, and others who haven't spent enough time studying history to know that their promises will probably not be met if they are elected to office.


I'm not trying to be combative here, just asking for a sincere discussion. When politicians promise you the world, don't you at least become a little suspicious? We live in a Democracy after all, not a dictatorship. Democracies always require heavy amounts of compromise, where no one gets 100% what they want, and change can be slow.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l1s0n/bernie_sanders_supporters_why_do_you_so_intently/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442329205,1444728194
