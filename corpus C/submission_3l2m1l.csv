3l2m1l,Russian Opinion of the US Over Decades,12,CQME,"[This infographic](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/opinions-in-russia/1620/) from the Washington Post highlights Russian opinion of the US over the past 20-30 years.  Things have taken a lasting and dramatic turn towards the worse since the onset of the Ukrainian crisis.

That however is not the point I'd like to make with this post.  Rather, I'd like to ask people how easily is it for politicians (at least in Russia) to manipulate public opinion? [ The accompanying article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russias-anti-us-sentiment-now-is-even-worse-than-it-was-in-soviet-union/2015/03/08/b7d534c4-c357-11e4-a188-8e4971d37a8d_story.html) makes it clear that there were spikes in negative opinion - the NATO bombing of Serbia, the Iraq War, the Russian-Georgian conflict.  Some of these, however, especially the Russian-Georgian conflict and the current Ukrainian crisis, were both instigated by Russia.

Do you think it's natural for the Russians to scapegoat NATO/US whenever the latter is involved, or do you think this is deliberate manipulation by the Russian media to paint the matter in a negative light?  Or do you think it's both?  Or neither?",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3l2m1l/russian_opinion_of_the_us_over_decades/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442341605,1444728131
