cuyhzmu,1,t3_3klrc7,NOAHA202,"Trump likely won't go away for a while even if his support declines

Bush has the funds to stay in the race for quite a while (the turtle wins the race)

I think that Rubio is a stronger candidate than Walker, who atm is fairly lost positions wise, and Rubio is a stronger speaker imo from seeing the debate.

Carson or Cruz - I think that Carson has more potential to unite religious conservatives and moderates (he has a very high favorablility and IIRC fairly moderate economic ideas), as well as appealing to minorities (his background especially gives him experience in the struggles of the poor) than Cruz does, but I don't know if he has the political skills to be a consistent tier 1 candidate - Cruz has much more experience politically in running a campaign.

I think that Santorum, Jindal, Graham, Gilmore  Pataki, and Paul have basically no chance, and Huckabee will not gain enough political traction no matter what he does. Also, Christie's low favorability and weak polling will be his demise

I could see either Fiorina or Kasich having a slim chance of breaking through (compared to those I listed above), but I think that they will have a better shot at being VP. ",2,0,1442015438,1444729833

Trump and Bush have the resources to last the entire process, and Fiorina and Cruz both benefit from debate appearances and will likely keep seeing incremental gains throughout the process.  Assuming they can keep up their strong debate performances, I'd say the polling in the final four goes Trump with a few points lead followed by Bush then Cruz and Fiorina running neck and neck 8 to 10 points behind Bush.",2,0,1442028908,1444729833

Huckabee and Santorum have shown us that candidates of that type last long but they don't win. Bush, Walker and Rubio have the largest chances of winning, but ultimately I don't think Walker will make it.
