Personally, I think the weakest point is not the nuclear deal itself but the fact that the whole deal is likely to fail with how current politics of both countries are going. Iran is pushing hard for influence through-out the middle east and were pushing back with the Sauds. This is unlikely to stop and will only escalate. As this escalates the deal will likely fall apart leading to political crisis where we have to bomb Iran. 

That said. I don't think it's any different than not having it. It's a question of attacking them now, attacking when it does fall apart or maybe, just maybe, they feel enough pressure from their people to keep this thing going. ",10,0,1442910557,1444725548

Israel has a huge stake in US domestic politics. This is why powerful lobbying groups like AIPAC exist. It is in Israel's interest to have the United States as a firm ally, so it has an interest in ensuring that the elected officials of the United States pursue pro-Israel foreign policy.

It doesn't give access to military facilities. It gives a 24 day wait time before inspections. Those 2 facts make it very bad. Lifting sanctions and paying them to not allow military facilities to be inspected is the icing on the cake.

Do you need me to list all of the terrorist attacks and innocent people that have been killed because of their radical theocratic government?

>People are racist against muslims thinking that radicalization is unique to Islam

Well let's see...they had a religious revolution in which they held americans hostage for a year, and ever since, their main, and plainly stated goal, has been death to America, Isreal, and all other infidels. In regards to Iran, people are not racist against muslims (especially considering that religion isn't a race), their untrusting of a theocracy which has waged ""jihad"" against the west since 1979.

>People believe the Bible requires America to ALWAYS defend and support Israel no matter what

Where are you getting this stuff? Israel is our only true western ally in the region. You'll find PLENTY of people who support a strong relationship with Israel that has nothing to do with the bible at all, but rather the geo-political situation that is the middle east.

>People believe the U.S. has the ability to unilaterally create any treaty it wants

It does. The US does not have to seek approval from any other country in the world to enter into agreements.

>People think that sanctions and punishments will better incentivize countries to cooperate than diplomacy and compromises will

Sanctions are the entire reason Iran was even willing to come to the table and talk. A few more years and their people might have overthrown the theocracy in favor a government not hell bent on the destruction of all infidels.

False. Iran does not need to ""research"" how to make a nuclear bomb. It's 70 year old technology that is well understood. What they need is to enrich uranium to make it weapons-grade. That is the longest part of creating a nuclear bomb, and the only real factor that is worth considering the timing for. Just about any country with a military can create a bomb in a few months if you give them the nuclear material. If you want to slow down a nation's capacity to make a bomb from scratch, you make them give up their highly enriched uranium and shutter a bunch of their centrifuges, which this deal does.

This is what pisses me off about people who support the deal.  They clear spent no time looking into how it actually works.  Currently we do not have unrestricted access.

You're a pretty poor researcher yourself it seems. That assertion is basically entirely false.

Claims that the deal allows Iran to inspect itself are pure misinformation, and you're propagating it.

> Currently we do not have unrestricted access.

The restrictions are very minimal. Probably the lowest level of restrictions in the history of a nuclear inspections regime (feel free to cite otherwise). At most, Iran gets to stonewall an inspection for 24 days which is in no way enough time to eliminate evidence of nuclear material having been present, nor to install and make any progress with the centrifuges necessary to enrich uranium to weapons-grade level.

> Lastly the left is totally ok just opening the flood gates of cash to a country that we know sponsors terrorism and all fro some promises from a country that has never proven trustworthy.

No, we just think it's ridiculous to say that that's equally as bad as Iran getting a nuclear weapon or not having to open itself to inspections. I mean, the sanctions were there in order to get them to scale back their nuclear program. This is what they are now doing. This was the leverage that we had over them, and it worked.

Well of course you can't answer that question, because there really is no element of trust in play here. The deal is based on mistrust, hence it being about inspecting Iran. There is no component of the deal that relies on us trusting them to do anything, only verification measures. So asking questions like that indicates either a severe lack of basic knowledge on your part, or more likely, intentional bias by asking a pointless question designed to mislead. 

What component of the deal would you describe as based around trust, instead of verification measures?

>I mean if the US is actually focused on them not getting a bomb then we should demand that we get access to all their sites and have our own inspectors present.

Oh, so you're anti IAEA now? They're the ones who uncovered Iran's secret nuclear work in the first place, so you really shouldn't have an issue with it. There's no reason to think U.S. inspectors would do any better, and the reason we didn't push for them is because that's not how the nuclear nonproliferation treaty works, and because this was a deal negotiated with 5 other countries as well who were not going to go along with that unnecessary idea.

Terrorism is defined as ""the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives"".

In South Korea, the United States directly supported the Jeju Massacre, labeling an ""anti-communist"" operation, resulting in the murder of anywhere between 14,000 and 30,000 civilians.

The United States has supported terrorist death squads and other forms of state-sponsored terrorism in numerous Latin American countries in what was known as Operation Condor.

In Chile, we supported Pinochet and the ""Caravan of Death"". Pinochet, who came to office in a US-supported coup, was responsible for kidnapping, torturing, and murdering 30,000 civilians during his reign with US support. Even the CIA now openly admits that many of Pinochet's officers -- those responsible for the kidnappings and disappearances -- were trained and supported by the United States.

In Argentina, the United States armed and trained the forces responsible for the mass disappearance, torture, and murder of over 20,000 Argentine civilians.

We supported the death squads of El Salvador during their civil war, responsible for 70,000 political killings. We armed, trained, and supported the Contras, who were guilty of killing 50,000 Nicaraguan men, women, and children during nearly a decade of state-sponsored terrorist activity.

The United States trained and armed Battalion 3-16, a notorious death squad in Honduras, responsible for the kidnapping, torture, and murder of hundreds of left-wing students, journalists, union leaders, and so on.

The United States funded and supported the Guatemalan death squads, responsible for 100,000 murders and assassinations during the course of their 36-year civil war.

Even today, the United States supports death squads in Colombia as a part of the ""War on Drugs"". In addition to political repression, mass rapes, and extrajudicial killings, the Colombian government's death squads -- armed and funded by the United States -- run ""chop houses"", where kidnap victims are dismembered alive.

During the Vietnam War, we armed, trained, and funded a political repression campaign by the South, responsible for the disappearance and death of thousands of civilians.

We explicitly and openly support terrorism against Iran, most notably by giving support to the People's Resistance Movement of Iran, a Sunni militant organization and al-Qaeda affiliate, which even the US itself classifies as a terrorist organization.

In Iraq we supported, funded, and armed Saddam Hussein throughout the 80s, and supported his use of repression, murder, and use of chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels -- because it was the Cold War and they were ""communist"". When the Cold War was over, we supported anti-Saddam insurgents through the 90s -- lead by none other than Iyad Allawi -- and which included bombings, sabotage, and other acts of terror against our former ally.

We are also are the largest supporter and military supplier of weapons to Israel, which has been conducting a campaign of state terrorism on an epic scale against the civilian population of Gaza. Acts of terrorism include targeting civilians, using civilian shields, kidnapping, torture, assassination, and collective punishment.

We are also directly operating a terror campaign in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Yemen. The US military's drone campaign is guilty of intentionally targeting medics, journalists, and civilians, including women and children. Under Obama's administration alone, over 2,000 civilians have been killed in drone strikes, often in countries where we have no official authority to operate and where we are not a part of any war.

Unfortunately, no definition of ""terrorism"", including the one used by the United States itself, has a ""communism exemption"".

I didn't say ""no different"". My claim is extraordinarily simple: the United State sponsors state terrorism.

First of all, Hamas doesn't do these things to a ""larger extent"" than the Israelis. Not for lack of will, of course -- they would if they could, if not worse. Hamas simply doesn't have access to cluster bombs, attack helicopters, tanks, and so on, and trust me, it's a good thing they don't. That being said, if funding, training, arming, and providing political and intelligence support does not count as ""support"" for Israel, I'm not sure what does. As to whether their actions constitute ""terrorism"", this is not really disputable: their actions would count as terrorism using almost every definition of the term, including the definition used by the United States. Israel's actions would *certainly* count as terrorism under the Rome Statute and the international standards used by the rest of the developed world.

>Also disagree here.

It's not a matter of disagreement, [it has been documented.](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/us-drones-strikes-target-rescuers-pakistan). And we were [caught attacking medics on tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rXPrfnU3G0)... so yeah.

My main point is that the US is a significant sponsor of state terrorism. That's all.

In terms of raw numbers, I would *seriously doubt* that Iran would be responsible for more deaths than the United States.

They totally do.  It is the basis of their strategy.  They readily place military operations in hospitals, place them in schools.  Teach children to fire mortars.

>Hamas simply doesn't have access to cluster bombs, attack helicopters, tanks, and so on, and trust me, it's a good thing they don't.

This seems to be the ""proportionate force"" argument.  Meaning, if Hamas has a sword, Israel should be bound to only use swords to attack Hamas, even if they have guns at their disposal.  

I don't agree with proportionate force.  It leads to more war and more death.

>That being said, if funding, training, arming, and providing political and intelligence support does not count as ""support"" for Israel, I'm not sure what does.

I'd say it does count as support for Israel.  But Israel isn't a terrorist state.

That's within the rules of engagement.  *The second claim is that they shot up civilians for no reason*.  **The  reason those people got shot up is because they entered a war zone in an unmarked van to remove people and materials from a previous target.**  That isn't something that is expected from civilians, there is no way for a military to know if those people are helping the people they just engaged or removing valuable intelligence.

Nevertheless, the US targeted and killed journalists. When you turn an entire city into a ""battlefield"" and when every object becomes a ""weapon"", it becomes rather difficult to assign the blame for that on the people living there.

I have no idea what ""philosophical point"" you're referring to. I made a simple claim -- that the US is a state sponsor of terrorism. You asked me to support the claim. I did. You now agree with the claim.

You're the one who's attempted to stray from the point -- bringing up proportionality, saying that Iran is ""exactly the same"" as the United States, bringing up the various intents of the actors. You will notice that at every turn I've ignored these diversions and have stayed on my original, simple, and -- as I said from the very beginning -- *incontrovertible* point: the US is a sponsor of state terrorism. It's a fact. Doesn't matter if we like it. Doesn't matter if we hate it. It's a part of the world we live in. End of story.

>You're not actually interested in that argument, you're only interested in attacking the US.

First of all, you're in no position to tell me what I'm ""interested in"". I made a simple factual statement. You expressed disbelief. I backed it up. End of story.

Pointing to a historical fact is not an ""attack"". The fact that you would even think so shows rather clearly how emotional and defensive you are about the issue. Methinks someone watched a few too many GI Joe cartoons growing up.

You will notice that nowhere have I expressed a judgement about the morality of the United States or the validity of its actions. Nowhere. Nowhere did I say the United States is a *bad country* for doing these things, nor have I even said the United States has a *bad government* for doing these things. They're historical facts. Some of them are still going on. It's the world we live in. It's reality.

Basically, you are angry that the facts don't match up with your imagination of what you *want* the US's history to be. Boo hoo. Go watch some TV or something if you can't deal with reality.

I'm not interested in how things ""should be"". I'm much more interested in seeing how the sausage is made than arguing about how it looks on the dinner table.

>If you let their government ideas take over, it would. They currently hang homosexuals. In the US, our debate is over wedding services for gays.

Again, your emotions are getting the better of you. Saying that Iran's body count is lower than ours isn't to say that their government has *good intentions*. It's simply to say that Iran is a regional power and the US, China, and Russia are superpowers. That's the only salient difference.

Pretty sure a Rocket Propelled Grenade is a legit weapon and at the time, yes, the entire city of Fallujah was a battlefield.  That happens in wartime, Stalingrad had it way worse than Fallujah.  As for the blame of people living there, yes, civilians are not supposed to be involved with enemy combatants and they took themselves into a live fire zone and got themselves killed.  That's not a terrorist action, that's a war action.  

>I'll note that you ignored the other piece of the argument about attacking rescuers. 

You'd be wrong, that was the comment about the lack of Red Crescent/Red Cross markings.  I was talking directly about the attack on rescuers.

If you are referring to the Pakistani link, the statement describes the same type of incident.

""In the first strike, four missiles were fired on two vehicles in the Mana Gurbaz area of district Shawal in North Waziristan Agency, while two missiles were fired in the second strike at the same site where militants were removing the wreckage of their destroyed vehicles.""

>You also ignored the part about our rendition and torture program.

Where was the rendition and torture program mentioned previously?  

The rendition program exists because the US generally *doesn't* treat prisoners humanely.  The ""torture program"" has to be the world's most mild torture program in existence.  We poured water on about 3 people's faces.  

>I have no idea what ""philosophical point"" you're referring to.

The one I was talking about around that statement.  The one about the US supporting groups that did bad things...similar to what Iran is doing with Hezbollah and Hamas.  The point that I was trying to get you to focus on rather than this current spaghetti at the wall approach you're taking now.

>You're the one who's attempted to stray from the point

I felt like I was trying to get you to focus on that one point about sponsoring groups that do bad things.  The more you write about, the more I respond to.  So you can either focus and talk about that one point, which I was trying to agree with, but you seem so argumentative that you don't even want any agreement.

>You will notice that at every turn I've ignored these diversions and have stayed on my original, simple, and -- as I said from the very beginning -- incontrovertible point: the US is a sponsor of state terrorism.

You've done quite a bit of drifting around the point. Hence why I tried to get you to focus on that one overall point you were making.

>First of all, you're in no position to tell me what I'm ""interested in"".

Sure I am and I just did tell you that.

>I made a simple factual statement. 

I'm really quite certain you don't know what a fact is and now I question whether you know what the word simple means.

>The fact that you would even think so shows rather clearly how emotional and defensive you are about the issue.

Not emotional about it at all.  I do disagree with your stance, so yes, I am defending against it.  

>You will notice that nowhere have I expressed a judgement about the morality of the United States or the validity of its actions.

Maybe I'm just reading different comments.  Perhaps your comments read a lot differently to you.  

>Basically, you are angry that the facts don't match up with your imagination of what you want the US's history to be. Boo hoo. Go watch some TV or something if you can't deal with reality.

You're just being silly here, I've been well aware of the US support for Cold War rebels, which is why I conceded that that can be considered the same thing as supporting terrorism.  Heck, I wanted to talk about that...but instead you want to say things like ""boo hoo"" and ""Go watch tv""


>Again, your emotions are getting the better of you.

That wasn't an emotional argument, its an argument about the reality of the world they create.

>You're making this about morality. Morality is boring. It's a joke. Pay attention to reality. It's more interesting, to begin with, and it's the only thing that matters anyway.

Morality arguments are about reality.  If you live in a society that is created that does messed up stuff and supports messed up stuff, that's a reality that most people wouldn't want to live in. That's not a joke, it's the cause of conflict.",-1,0,1442966982,1444725580

Intent matters, but it doesn't matter more than actually taking human life. Face it, there's no way to win this one: Israel kills more civilians than Hamas. There's no way you can talk your way out of that fact. 

>Pretty sure a Rocket Propelled Grenade is a legit weapon and at the time, yes, the entire city of Fallujah was a battlefield.

Uh... the attack happened in Baghdad.

>As for the blame of people living there, yes, civilians are not supposed to be involved with enemy combatants and they took themselves into a live fire zone and got themselves killed. That's not a terrorist action, that's a war action.

Oh, so it's just as easy as ""not being involved"" in... the place where live? Other than dying, how exactly do you do that?

>You'd be wrong, that was the comment about the lack of Red Crescent/Red Cross markings. I was talking directly about the attack on rescuers.

Pretty sure killing civilians is still illegal even if they're not marked as medics.

>Where was the rendition and torture program mentioned previously?

My mistake, I thought I included it in my large list of offenses. Nevermind. It's not like I need it to make my point.

>The rendition program exists because the US generally doesn't treat prisoners humanely. The ""torture program"" has to be the world's most mild torture program in existence. We poured water on about 3 people's faces.

We also sodomized people with feeding tubes until their assholes literally fell apart, let people freeze to death, left people in ""stress positions"" on broken limbs, conducted mock executions, threatened people's families, and so on.

>The one I was talking about around that statement. The one about the US supporting groups that did bad things...similar to what Iran is doing with Hezbollah and Hamas. The point that I was trying to get you to focus on rather than this current spaghetti at the wall approach you're taking now.

You mean you were trying to change the subject when I backed up the claims you were skeptical of? By ""spaghetti on the wall"", do you mean ""providing evidence for precisely the point in question"", to the point where even you admit that I was right? Please let me know if I'm warm here.

>You've done quite a bit of drifting around the point. Hence why I tried to get you to focus on that one overall point you were making.

No, you've repeatedly tried to change the subject in order to avoid admitting you were wrong, while I've stayed completely on-topic by backing up the very specific assertion I made from the beginning.

Simple fact is, you started out calling the claim that the US sponsors terrorism a ""stance"", where I called it a ""fact"", and now you've admitted it's a fact. I'm sure you'd love to make this conversation about something else, because I've proved my point.

>I'm really quite certain you don't know what a fact is and now I question whether you know what the word simple means.

Unfortunately for you, the facts are on my side.

Answer this simple question: is it or is it not a fact that the US sponsors terrorism?

>Maybe I'm just reading different comments. Perhaps your comments read a lot differently to you.

Do you know what words are? The squiggly lines on the screen? They mean things. I either said something or I didn't something. This isn't a mental ward where your feelings and figments of your imagination become ""facts"". Unless you're a lunatic or are under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, I either say things or I don't.

""These facts make me feel bad, so he must be attacking America!""

And here *you* are the one saying that *I* don't know what ""facts"" are.

>You're just being silly here, I've been well aware of the US support for Cold War rebels, which is why I conceded that that can be considered the same thing as supporting terrorism. Heck, I wanted to talk about that...but instead you want to say things like ""boo hoo"" and ""Go watch tv""

So you admit that it's a fact that the US sponsors terrorism. Great. Glad we agree.

Iran has always been tagged this way through their support of Hezbollah and other groups like that in the region.

I can concede that, they back groups because they have a similar goal as Iran, such as the destruction of Israel or overthrow of governments in the region.
