I don't see that at all here.",7,0,1441493957,1444732298

In this system You would be letting the man/woman (who you think is the wisest and best represents your view) pick the high tier politician for you.

cus27cq,1,t3_3jsowy,tenthreeleader,"At first glance, this looks like a pyramid scheme, which is illegal in business.  However, there are limited precedents for this sort of scheme in the United States.

One would be the Electoral College.

The other was replaced by the 17th Amendment to the Constitution, allowing direct election of United States Senators.  Originally, Senators were elected by members of state legislatures, which seems sort of like Tier Two electing Tier Three.

That said, I think your system lowers influence of the lower levels of the spectrum.  Not sure that's a good idea.",1,0,1441502633,1444732306
