3mwo71,Ted Cruz should be ruled Constitutionally ineligible to run for President,49,Saffuran,"I'm wondering why Ted Cruz running for president at all has not been a major issue being raised by especially the far right wing people who falsely accused Barack Obama of not truly being an American. I suppose it's because Ted is a lame duck candidate and a lame duck senator who very well could likely be seeing his time in Congress coming to an end, but still it begs the discussion.

Ted Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada which is not within U.S. soil and since questions were raised of Barack Obama's parents the same questions could be raised for Cruz, whose mother was a U.S. Citizen but had a father hailing from Cuba.

Why is it that Ted Cruz is being allowed to soak up any air time at all in a presidential debate of any capacity when he himself, by the staunch and strict interpretation of the Constitution to which many wish to adhere, is not an American citizen and therefore shouldn't even be in consideration for the role even as a huge long shot.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3mwo71/ted_cruz_should_be_ruled_constitutionally/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443574842,1444721857
