https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Cain_presidential_campaign,_2012#Top-tier

""On September 24, 2011, Cain won a surprise victory in a Republican presidential straw poll in Florida, with 37 percent of the 2,657 votes cast. The front-runner Rick Perry, who had been leading in the polls, came in second with 15 percent."" 

None of this actually matters in September. Most Americans aren't paying attention yet.

>And curiously, none of them are suffering the dire consequences predicted by conservatives with regard to government-run health care.

I'm not debating healthcare with you. You're trying to do the thing that people hate Fox News for. You're making a straw man out of the other side, and it's sort of silly. But just because I don't hate republicans doesn't mean I agree with them like you seem to think. Believe it or not, but there are merits to both arguments generally. Maybe there is more merit in socializing health care, but that doesn't mean that the other sides argument is completely asinine and not worth considering, and instead building straw men out of them because you disagree with their policy positions. I don't understand the point of this sub if we do the exact same stupid shit that /r/politics does every day. We build straw men out of whoever the thread is critiquing, and everyone walks away just as knowledgeable as before about the other side because they already built these preconceived notions.

Yes I linked Herman Cain who was leading republican polls in September of 2011. It doesn't matter this early because most voters aren't really paying that close of attention. Show me a poll when December comes, and I'll show you a poll where Carson has fallen back.

Yes, but people paying attention in September is a minority of the party. so that point is sort of pointless. Plus people always like the outsiders at this point in the election, and then election time comes, and the expected top tier ends up being the actual top tier. Carson is not expected to continue these sort of polling numbers.

HE is making this about international politics. When he says Americas greatest friend and ally of the conservatives has healthcare.
