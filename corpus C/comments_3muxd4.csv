The rising cost of tuition is still a concern, but I think it's because colleges have no incentive not to raise their prices as government will keep giving loans to everyone who wants one regardless of what they're majoring in, and many 18 year olds are terrible at judging what a good investment is. A possible fix for this is to tie interest rates and loan availability to the educational outcomes of students chosen school and major.

 Want to major in mechanical engineer at Berkeley, government will keep giving you a loan, want to attend a vocational school that will give you high skills for manufacturing, government will give you a loan, want to major in art history? Well  you're not getting a loan unless you're going to a school where art history majors are finding good job out of college, or if you do get a loan it will be at a much higher interest rate. 

Increase federal standards for school documenting how people with particular degrees do post graduations, and extend loans to non traditional 4 year programs.

I will just say we've passed that point already. With the amount of government aid and the amount institutions for education, the market is flooded with degree beyond repair. Right now its about your qualification and experience with the degree just being the key to open the door. In todays world, a Bachelors is now the equivalent of a HS diploma; the HS diploma is useless. 

I see free college as a net gain:

* More people will be able to qualify for more jobs; not just jobs based on their major. Lots of jobs require just a bachelors to even apply.
* A better educated population. 
* Students will have more money available to them to help the local economy
* Graduated students will spend more money on the economy now that parts of their income does not go toward student loans any longer. 
* More innovation and economic growth. Many graduated students stay in jobs that hold back their potential or dont open up a business because they need a restrictive job to pay their student loans.
