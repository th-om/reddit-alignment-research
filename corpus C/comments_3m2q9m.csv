denying service to people illegally?

You (and the author) seem to assume that this happens all the time and people are totally ok with it and just not paying attention.

Most of these conservative news sources will report on anything remotely conservative because they know their audience wouldn't bother to do any kind of due diligence on their reporting.

No, I did not. I implied nothing of the sort.

I repeat: I assumed nothing about you. You're reading more into my reply than there is.

Your original reply was:

> Honestly, anything from the huffpo is not worth much due to their extreme biases. Is there a study or another source for the info they provided?

The tl;dr of my original response is basically: the original news source is crappy. I found another, slightly less crappy source that says otherwise. Unless we can find better sources on this story, there's really not much to discuss that would be based in fact.",2,0,1443029397,1444725114

I agree, we need better sources.

cvbfb5w,1,t3_3m2q9m,tgjer,"Chick-fil-A didn't just have a CEO who personally objected to gay marriage. Chick-fil-A used profits from the company to actively fund organizations that worked to restrict and deny legal marriage rights to same gender couples.

And if you know of an actual case where a Muslim owned business in the US was legally allowed to refuse service on the basis of race, creed, sex, etc., I'd like to see some real citations. The anecdote cited is not verifiable, and since it didn't go to court it isn't legally relevant.

Moreover, it is not illegal to refuse service on the basis of non-protected traits. A business can say *""We don't serve people we don't know""*, and this is perfectly legal, because *""People Business X doesn't already know""* is not a legally protected category.

Of course, if this anecdote is real and the woman had actually taken it to court, she might argue that the business was actually refusing her service because they didn't know she was Muslim and didn't want to sell halal meat to a non-Muslim. But she would have to prove that was their reason for refusing her service to win the case. It's possible that wasn't their reason. Maybe their supply of halal meat is limited, and with Eid coming up they want to favor established customers before new ones. That would be perfectly legal.",5,0,1443022202,1444725114

No they didn't. The owner of Chick-fil-A donated his personal money to a group that donated money to a group that was for traditional marriage.
