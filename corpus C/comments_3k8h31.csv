Even Chuck Norris movies in the 80's were pretty ruthless.  I remember one that depicted a full on rape and murder scene.  All in all, I don't think it's gotten more violent.  I think the effects just got better. 

It's the same with music.  People say music is now particularly vulgar.  But, it isn't.  Billy Joel wrote Captain Jack which was all about sitting at home, getting high, and jerking off while your sister is gone.  Tom Petty wrote numerous songs about doing drugs.  Even going back to Vaudeville burlesque you find some extremely racey stuff.  People forget there was an old BB King recording of him improvising a blues about a lesbian.  The words to the first verse were...

There was two girls
Layin' out on the sand. 
One said to the other, 
""I wish you was a man.""
She looked back at that girl
And said, ""Honey, I ain't no man.
But lay right there and spread 'em
And I'll do the best that I can!""

Kim Kardashian has a show on cable network I have never seen, because there are 300 other channels, and if I choose to watch tv I watch other things. I suppose an argument could be made everything is overloaded because of the competition demand either quality or outrageousness to get attention.
