3n4h4b,"""Hillary isn't trying hard yet!"" - true, but does it matter?",76,Starbuckrogers,"Clinton’s national polling has [steadily dropped](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html) from 63% at her campaign kickoff to 40% three months later. Hillary has lost 23%, Bernie has risen 14% and Biden has risen 8% while the percent of ‘unaligned’ voters has held steady (12-13%).

**It’s claimed that Hillary is not campaigning heavily, “keeping her powder dry,” staying out of the spotlight, etc.** So it doesn’t matter that Sanders is [drawing bigger crowds](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/20/two-days-later-sanders-draws-five-times-as-many-people-as-clinton-to-event-at-same-university-in-n-h/?tid=sm_tw) and has even [**matched her fundraising**](http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/30/politics/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-fundraising/index.html) because the “real campaign” hasn’t started yet.

My question is: **does it matter?** 

Suppose Hillary ***”pulled out all the stops”*** tomorrow - full throttle campaign mode. Would her polls rise?

No.

1. Hillary’s name recognition is essentially 100%. Only [8% of voters](http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2274) decline to offer an opinion of her, far lower than Jeb (26%), Rubio (27%), or Sanders (36%). People are easier to persuade *before* they’ve made up their minds.

2. Just like 2008, **Team Hillary has a message control problem.** The emails are only part of it. When her campaign recently decided to switch gears, the national media disastrously reported it as a process story: [***“Hillary Clinton to Show More Humor and Heart, Aides Say”***](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/us/politics/hillary-clinton-to-show-more-humor-and-heart-aides-say.html?hpw&rref=us&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well&_r=1). Then the blogs ran headlines like “Hillary Plans To Be More Spontaneous.” One NYT commenter asked the obvious question: “What could possibly have motivated Hillary Clinton's strategists to participate in these interviews?” Unfortunately, as Obama ’07 supporters remember, [Hillaryland has a long history](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/19/hillary-clinton-2016-mark-penn_n_4993424.html) of turf-warring consultants who use media leaks to snipe at each other and [2016 so far has continued that trend](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/david-brock-resigns-priorities-usa-action-115028). In addition, the media simply has a fascination with Hillary process stories (remember the **Chipotle** farce?). Any ramp-up of her campaign would likely be drowned in media meta-commentary that dissects her every move while mostly ignoring the content of her stump speeches.

3. **Hillary's greatest source of unpopularity - the impression that she's untrustworthy - is a self-fulfilling prophecy.** When voters were asked to brainstorm words to describe candidates, Hillary's most often-mentioned words were ['liar' and 'untrustworthy'](http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2274). **Everything she does is interpreted in the worst light** precisely because people already see her as a phony focus-grouped politician. Just look at when she came out against the **Keystone pipeline** - pretty liberal move, but all the headlines were construing it as a calculated and craven anti-Sanders maneuver.

##For these reasons, I don't think Hillary has a lot of unexplored upside potential. I don't think we will see Hillary ""start"" to campaign and then promptly wreck Bernie.
