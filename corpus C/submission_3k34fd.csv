3k34fd,Why are well-known political cartoonists liberal? Is it because they were hired by liberal newspapers?,93,garfangle,I've noticed that most of the prominent cartoonists who delve into politics either explicitly (Tom Toles) or as a narrative (Garry Trudeau of Doonesbury) are quite liberal. Do you think this is a function of being hired by liberal newspapers like the Washington Post because their city-dominated readership is also fairly liberal and it would be discordant to have a cartoonist who doesn't share their views?,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3k34fd/why_are_wellknown_political_cartoonists_liberal/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441715089,1444731608
