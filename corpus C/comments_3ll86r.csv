cv78jcf,1,t3_3ll86r,prinzplagueorange,"Well the immediate end of the occupations was due to coordinated state repression pursued primarily by the Democratic Party.  But yes, I would say that OWS had huge problems with organization (if not so much with lack of leaders) and that many of the supporters of OWS are now supporting Sanders.  I would stress, though, that most of the smarter OWS activists understood that change will not come from above (from elected politicians), but only from a mass movement.  What is interesting about Sanders is the possibility of his campaign helping to rekindle such a movement, not so much whether he wins the primary or gets elected.  In fact, Sanders himself already seems to be trying to moderate his positions.",2,0,1442695123,1444726516

cv7az0h,0,t1_cv7am8q,prinzplagueorange,"Bad press doesn't lead to police action.  Crime is a funny allegation, though.  During the NYC occupation the park quickly filled up with homeless people.  Odd how homeless people developed such a sudden interest in politics.  So my friends asked them, ""Why are you guys coming down here?"". They replied that that had been sent to Zuccotti by the NYC police!  The cops were going up to homeless people all over the city and saying we're going to arrest you for vagrancy unless you get down to Zuccotti (where no one gets arrested for vagrancy)!  The cops filled the occupation up with crack heads to drive out the protestors.  Brilliant strategy.  Interviews detailing this are in Verso's Ocuppy book.",0,0,1442699858,1444726516

cv792fr,0,t1_cv78rzw,prinzplagueorange,"The occupations were located primarily in major US cities.  Those cities are all Democratic Party strongholds (in most cases one party towns).  The occupations were all ended by law enforcement within a few hours of each other in what was obviously a coordinated action.  Those were Democratic officials order police to shut down a political movement that was basically accusing the Democratic Party of having abandoned the working class.  It was clear at the start of the occupation that there was enough pressure being exerted on the Democratic Party by labor unions to keep their hands off the occupiers, but they couldn't let it go on too long.",0,0,1442696152,1444726516

cv79go8,0,t1_cv792fr,bartink,That's a huge stretch. All these mayors collaborated at the behest of the Democratic Party. Evidence? They are Democratic politicians with Democratic mayors.

cv7a7kl,0,t1_cv79go8,prinzplagueorange,"The occupations were all shut down on the same night all over the country!  That fact alone means that it was obviously coordinated.  (So does the extensive and coordinated law enforcement surveillance which has been revealed due to FOIA).  I have friends who were charged with felonies for their participation in OWS.  (Their crimes were quite light and should have been misdemeanors.) They all understood those felony charges as political payback that was coming from the Democratic Party machinery.  (The DA was a Democrat and so were the judges.) The rest of your point, I don't understand, but most of the key OWS activists were self-identified anarchists or socialists who were well to the left of Clinton and Obama.  Many of them are self consciously hostile to the Democratic Party though quite a few of them are currently supporting Sanders because they think he is spearheading an insurrection against the Democratic machinery.",-2,0,1442698380,1444726516
cv7cgyi,0,t1_cv7a7kl,bartink,"You still haven't said anything other than the fact that Democratic strongholds produced both Democratic politicians and occupy protestors, which should come as no surprise to anyone. Your occupy friend ""understanding"" something isn't evidence of much of anything either. I spent some time at occupy and while people meant well, most of them were straight up conspiracy theorists. Was disappointing actually. That's when I knew the movement was doomed.

We are talking about a huge collaboration of hundreds of people and their staff. You really believe no one talked in a bunch Democrat offices? You have never worked in a Democrat office then. ",3,0,1442702744,1444726516
cv7evzv,0,t1_cv7cgyi,prinzplagueorange,"I don't understand what point you are trying to make.  My position is very simply that Occupy arose from activists who were well to the left of the Democratic Party and most of these activists were very conscious of that fact.  The occupations were kept open for several weeks due to pressure on public officials from activists on the left edge of the Democratic Party (labor unions primarily), and they were eventually shut down when more conservative forces also aligned with the Democratic Party won out.  Maybe we will eventually find out which officials wanted to do what about the protests, but the narrative I have given fits all of the available facts about the protests.  Excusing more conservative Democrats from the closure of the occupations does not fit the available facts.  The OP asked if Sanders was carrying on the spirit of OWS.  My point is that he is too closely assigned with the Democratic Party for that to be entirely true.",-1,0,1442707571,1444726516
cv7iphv,0,t1_cv7evzv,bartink,">the narrative I have given fits all of the available facts about the protests.

That's trivially true. If any mayor closed down occupy, a movement centered in democratic strongholds, they would be a democrat. You know what else fits those facts? 

A bunch of mayors got sick of continuous protests and probably in coordination with the feds, shut it down all at once. Since occupy wall street thrives in democrat strongholds, those mayors are democrats. Bloomberg isn't a democrat btw. New York was the flagship protest.",2,0,1442715477,1444726516
cv7jges,0,t1_cv7iphv,prinzplagueorange,The coordinating feds in this case would have been the Obama administration.  I don't see any significant difference between you wrote here and what I wrote earlier except that I am clearly intending to stress that the Democratic Party is not a left-wing organization or it would not have behaved in this manner.
