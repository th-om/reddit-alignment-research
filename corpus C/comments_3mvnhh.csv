cviiffj,0,t1_cviici7,zigmeister22,"He's already in third place (polls) and he hasn't even announced.  How will announcing this afternoon help him, vs. how much it would help Hillary.

Once Biden makes the announcement, he has to go into full-on campaign mode.  Doing that would sideline the email scandal (the last I heard, the CIA had found 2 emails classified as Top Secret on Hillary's personal server).  Why not wait a little longer and let all of the details come out.  Who knows, maybe they will find dozens more.",1,0,1443559071,1444722079

cvj8gng,0,t1_cvj1rew,aussiemourinho,"Just looking at his schedule, he looks like someone that would like to be President. Doing things like going on Colbert certainly points towards a run. From memory, that interview barely touched on policy - he wasn't doing any spruiking for the Obama administration. ",3,0,1443619437,1444722079
cviighq,1,t3_3mvnhh,itsmuddy,"I think it is more he is waiting to see if the email buries her.

If the party feels it is going to take her down Biden will feel obligated to step up for the party but I don't think he has any intention of trying to beat out Clinton. ",4,0,1443559108,1444722079

cvivyw9,0,t1_cviqrpp,RECIPR0C1TY,Really? I have heard this a lot lately. Who really cares about Obama's endorsement? I don't think endorsements actually accomplish anything.,-2,0,1443581816,1444722082
cviwknv,0,t1_cvivyw9,Rtat,"Although lots of endorsements are meaningless, a relatively popular sitting Democrat president endorsing Biden for the Democratic nomination is like a very big a deal, it's huuuuge. ",3,0,1443582948,1444722082
cvizk78,0,t1_cviwknv,rikross22,"It would be huge but I doubt Obama does it, he has such a long post presidency with his age and will be such a big part of the party going forward its best for him not to ruffle feathers ",1,0,1443589356,1444722082
cviwurp,0,t1_cviqrpp,lightmonkey,"No he's not. Joe Biden knows sitting Presidents do not endorse anyone other than the nominee. Obama might do things to help Biden behind the scenes, but publicly he will remain neutral until the party decides. ",5,0,1443583482,1444722082
cvisqra,1,t3_3mvnhh,mt_weather,"joe biden can't actually run, sadly. the first day he comes out, he will have to explain how his son Hunter failed to nationalize Ukraine's oil fields and caused a civil war which has empowered Russia.

he is more closely tied to the military industrial complex than anyone in the race except Bush.  he will be an unmitigated disaster if he tries to come in, simply obliterating hillary's base. Hillary really can't afford to have gone from 60% to 40% over the summer, biden would be the final nails in her political coffin.",-2,0,1443576063,1444722082
