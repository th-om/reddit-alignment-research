Infants are also innocent and have no choice in being there. At what point does the ""person"" stop having a right to leach nutrients off the body of another person?

Are you going to remain logically consistent and advocate that if necessary, the ""guilty"" party should have their body harvested in order to keep the ""innocent"" party alive?

If I get hit by a car and the only way to keep me alive is for the driver to donate some of their blood, should they be forced to? After all, I am completely innocent in the matter.

Neither is entitled to the mother's body. I'm not sure why you are having such a struggle comprehending that. A baby doesn't have a ""right"" to breastfeed does it?

The problem for the fetus is that the only way it can get resources is via the mother's body so it better hope the mom is willing to share. Babies have other entities that can and will provide it resources. The mother doesn't have to share and she has a right not to.

There are some types of birth control that regulate periods down to just a couple of times a year, so a woman wouldn't know she was late if it failed.  But by 4 months she'd have a bump, which gives her a month to decide.  ",5,0,1442962487,1444725486

cva2gzd,1,t3_3lwfqf,houinator,"> Currently, it is legal in the US to abort a fetus up to 24 weeks (6 months)

This is incorrect.  States are *allowed* to restrict abortions to protect the life of the fetus after viability (Roe v. Wade/Planned Parenthood v. Casey) which is generally accepted as 24 weeks nowadays (although live births have happened as early as 21 weeks), but several of them continue to allow abortion [up to the moment of birth](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/18/us/politics/abortion-restrictions.html?_r=0).

> Where do you draw the line? What qualifies as ""alive"" and why do you make this distinction?

To me, a fertilized egg is obviously alive.  If one of our rovers on Mars found a cell even half that complex, every newspaper on Earth would run the headline ""LIFE ON MARS!"" tomorrow.  However, i think that there is something to be said for the arguments that consciousness is tied to personhood.    Since we cannot pinpoint the exact moment consciousness begins, I believe it is important to err on the side of caution when we are talking about potentially killing a human being.   

Consider this hypothetical scenario:  You and a friend are going on a roadtrip.  Your friend is driving, when you notice something vaguely person lying shaped in the middle of the road up ahead.  You tell your friend ""I think that is a person in the road"".  He squints, and says ""Nah, i don't think that's a person"".  As you get closer, you become more and more sure it is a person, and ask him to go around it.  ""It's not a person! Besides, my car, my choice"" he says, as he runs over the shape.  Maybe he was right.  But what if he wasn't?

When we talk about when a human life potentially begins, I think its also important to consider when it ends.  In a strict legal sense, a human life is generally considered to have ended once all brain activity has ceased.  However, if you don't have a bunch of fancy brain imaging technology handy, you generally go by when you can no longer detect a pulse (heartbeat).  So if we reverse those definitions, we could consider a human life to have legally begun around when a heartbeat and/or brain activity is detectable.  While we know a heartbeat starts around week 3, it usually can't be detected till about week 6.  That is also about the point ([day 40](http://www.pregnancy.org/article/overview-fetal-development)) where we have the earliest evidence of what could be considered brain activity occurring.

Not necessarily important from a legal perspective, but I think it's also worth noting that before week six, there is a very high chance of miscarriage (chemical pregnancy).  Roughly 50% of pregnancies end in miscarriage naturally, and most of those occur during this period.",11,0,1442921787,1444725486

I've grown more conservative as I've become older. For me, the biggest consideration is that a fertilized egg, no matter how much un-human-like it appears in its early days, will eventually develop into a human being if left untouched, assuming the body does not reject it for its own reasons. If the body does reject it (miscarriage), that is not our choice or even concern; however, if we as humans intervene, that is a moral decision which we are responsible for.

That said, I cannot envision a world in which abortions were illegal. Sperm and eggs are incredibly plentiful, and it is inevitable that there will be far greater pregnancies than people want or even that the world can sustain. It is the sad? absurd? fact of nature that human life, early in its development, seems to be rather cheap, at least if you look at the numbers. It is also true that the life of the mother is affected by an unwanted pregnancy, an element that can't be rejected out of hand. I don't want to live in a society where people's lives are so strictly monitored and regulated that all abortions are illegal. 

So ultimately, I think that abortions that are in effect after-the-fact birth control are quintessentially a selfish act, but one I can't really blame people for making. A fetus extinguished even in its early days is, in most or many cases, an adult non-realized; in that sense, yes, it is homicide. If I ask myself the hypothetical, would many of these fetuses, if allowed to grow into adults, would be grateful for being alive?, my only conclusion is ""yes, probably most of them.""

That said, maybe some kids are better off not born to irresponsible parents, or kids who can't even care for themselves, or to addicts or whatever. Who knows. I don't have the ability to judge. 

Also you tend to think about it differently after you're a parent--at least this was the case for me. We had an unexpected pregnancy, but when we found out, the philosophical suddenly became the immediate, and emotionally our parental instincts kicked in immediately and we emotionally felt ourselves guardians of that yet-to-be-developed child. And so we happily went through with the pregnancy, and today that fetus is a happy nine-year-old. After all, he was created by an act of ours and really had no say in the matter; it is only honorable that we take responsibility for him and it.  The main point here is that after I had children I had a certain paternal instinct to care for the weak and defenseless that I did not have when I was in my 20's and carefree, and when my world was all about me.

So, I am sympathetic to both sides, and you are right, there is no right answer, in my mind at least. I can see why anti-abortionists view abortion as murder. I can also see why women would not want the anti-abortionists to dictate what they can do with their bodies. I think the best solution for the mess is lots and lots and lots of contraceptives. If we can avoid the insolvable problem, that is probably the best alternative. But it is an issue that will never be resolved. ",3,0,1442923306,1444725493

I simply don't think it is the government's business to be involved in a healthcare decision.  Doctors impose upon themselves codes of ethics and morality; why does the government need to add its uninformed opinion to the mix?  Abortion is a difficult private healthcare decision, and one that I don't think anyone makes lightly.  People are generally not evil, and certainly nobody will be waiting until month 7 to terminate a fetus unless there's a risk of death.  In short the government is full of stupid politicians: there is no need, reason, or benefit to them injecting themselves into a difficult, private, painful healthcare decision.

When does a fetus qualify for protection under the law -- when is it alive?  Since we can all agree that a sperm and egg cell do not qualify, but a born and breathing newborn does, there must be a point in between which marks the first moment that what will become the newborn deserves protection under the law.  It is known that up to 20% of pregnancies spontaneously abort before 5 months.  Since pregnancies before this point have a particularly high chance of not progressing they should never be considered for protection under the law.  I agree with using fetal viability as a metric, and since a fetus has a 50% survival rate outside of the womb at 24 weeks, it would not be unreasonable to consider such a fetus for legal protection.  *However* I am not a doctor, and every individual situation is bound to be different, to the point that no single law or policy can be perfect.

Hmm I dunno.  We do already have separate classes of legal people, minors, adults, and people with certain disabilities/ mental illnesses.  You can go to the extreme and claim that the second a sperm meets an egg there is a legal person, and any action leading to it's death is homicide, but then what about negligent homicide?

Also, when you disconnected yourself from that person, you wouldn't be ""killing"" them, rather you would be refusing to be their source of life. 

This is why the only pro-life argument that is potentially viable relies on the concept of parental responsibility. As in, a mother is more responsible to her dependent fetus than she would be to a dependent stranger on the street. Such arguments are, in my opinion, also dubious. 

This says nothing about whether abortion is the right thing to do, etc. etc., but it does suggest that a woman has a right to decide whether or not her body will be used by another dependent organism. 

I think pro-choice people have lost a lot of clout by talking about whether it's a life or not. Whether it's a life or not has nothing to do with the legal arguments. The legal arguments depend on the concept of viability and the fetus being dependent on the mother's body to survive, and the mother having the bodily autonomy to refuse such a dependent organism.

Also, these are culturally influenced as well. Some cultures don't make an exception for violence in war. Some don't make an exception for euthanasia.
