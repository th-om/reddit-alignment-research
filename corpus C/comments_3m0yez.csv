cvb4v33,1,t3_3m0yez,killerbrand,"Anecdotal, personal opinions:

Hillary - establishment candidate, very very likely to win nomination. Privacy stuff is concerning but otherwise she is well-vetted and has showed she understands Washington. Most likely 2016 president. 

Sanders - he's been very popular as an alternative candidate, which clearly shows that the populist left in america is growing. Won't win nomination, but his popularity clearly shows a desire among america's left that they want to be involved. He'll force Hillary to the left on some issues.

Webb, O'Malley, Chafee...yeah none of them approach relevancy.

Trump - extremely popular because he truly speaks his mind and is not afraid to go way outside party lines -  to the left (taxation on traders) or the right (border fence + mass deportation). His appeal is broad, but he'll eventually be brought down by 2 things - his arrogance/self-centrism, and his complete lack of knowledge in foreign policy and governance in general. Probably still ~50% chance he'll be the republican nominee.

Bush - In the absolute circus sideshow that Donald Trump has turned the 2016 republican nomination has turned into, its no wonder that bland, boring Jeb Bush has failed to stand out. This could be the republicans' undoing - his experience as governor and his liberal stance on immigration makes him the most likely republican to win the general election, if he can make it there.

Carson - great speaker and clearly a very smart man, another political outsider that is polling super well right now. Will probably do well due to the rare combination of being intelligent and being a right-leaning republican. Won't win primaries but he'll probably get a large portion of the further-right vote and some strong 2nd/3rd place finishes.

Fiorina - confident and a good speaker. successful as a businesswoman but her shortfalls are the same as Trump's - business knowledge does not translate to government & foreign policy knowledge.

Cruz - the Rick Santorum/Michelle Bachmann of this election. Keeping America's far right happy during the debates. Won't get more than a strong minority vote.

Paul - maybe the most honest politician you'll see on the trail. Doesn't have a real chance of winning but is popular enough to  keep issues of privacy and foreign policy on everybody's tongues

Rubio - not a good speaker, and doesn't have enough conviction in his positions to effectively distance himself from the competition. Seems like the kind of guy who might be effective 10-15 years from now, just not enough experience yet.

Huckabee - no chance. Has his same 5% of supporters that he's had the whole time. Says outrageous things every so often to keep his name in the news cycle. Irrelevant.

Kasich - Jon Huntsman of this race. Too centrist to ever have a chance at a republican nomination. Irrelevant as huckabee, but much smarter.

cvb32r7,1,t3_3m0yez,mcapello,"I like Bernie. Hillary will grind him into the dirt if she has to, but I like him and what he stands for. It'll be kind of sad seeing him get torn apart, but at least he'll land a few great punches before he goes down.

I hate Hillary. I wouldn't say that I hate her with any passion, but I do hate her. I think she's a spineless opportunist who will do or say anything to advance her career. That being said, I think she'd actually make a good POTUS. Obama was naive in a way she won't be. Hillary is smart, ruthless, and pragmatic. I say there's a 80% chance she'll win the general.

Trump is a clown. He'll be out by February. He's basically a dinosaur made out of flaming shit and he's taking down as many Republicans as he can. Watching him wreak havoc on an already-weak Republican field is enormously fun to watch.

Rand Paul I have a little bit of respect for. He takes risky positions for what he believes in. He also believes in some pretty stupid shit. But at least he has a spine.

Scott Walker's fate was entirely predictable. You can't base a campaign primarily off a record of shitting on schoolteachers and firefighters. It can be a part of your story if you're charismatic and stand for something, but Scott Walker had neither of those things. His end was forseen.

Bush is... well, a Bush. I don't dislike him as much as his brother, but that's not saying much. He seems smarter. Maybe not quite as reckless a guy. But he's obviously playing the game and will say some pretty stupid shit to win it. The sad thing is that you can kind of tell he doesn't believe what his handlers are feeding him. ""My brother kept us safe"" -- come on.

The only thing about Ted Cruz I'll say is that he strikes me as a creep. It wouldn't surprise me if he touches children. Just saying.",4,0,1442986801,1444725182
cvbwka5,1,t3_3m0yez,stuckmeformypaper,"I have a bernie bias, admittedly. But realistically he needs a strong millennial turnout to have a chance. Even if he wins, his brand of socialism won't go as far as his supporters want it to, because congress. Perhaps could serve as a benchmark for the fight against wealth inequality, but that's about it.

Hillary Clinton? Flip flopper. Yes, I used that term. Whatever pantsuits her career dictates her next move.

All other democrats aren't exactly worth mentioning. 

As for Trump, I don't like him but I also think the badgering he gets is completely out of proportion. If you're a leftist, he's far from the worst candidate.

Rand Paul: I can't hate on a libertarian. His foreign policy stance as well as that of civil liberties is enough for me to be perfectly fine with him in the Oval Office. Not that it's going very well for him, but still.

Jeb is more of the opposite. The prototypical neoconservative. I'm not religious, but God help us if he gets elected.

Jindal is another neoconservative, combine that with hardcore social conservatism and general crony capitalism. By far the worst 2016 candidate in my view. 

Huckabee... somehow all this guy seems to care about is outlawing gay marriage and abortion. That'll lock him up with one segment of voters and literally no one else. 

Sorry Christie, Trump already has you beaten on the whole outspokenness thing. And I thought Bobby Baccalieri got whacked at the end of the series? 

Kasich has the support of my uncle. Good for him I guess.

I really thought Ben Carson's candidacy was kind of a hoop dream for a select few people who didn't want to appear racist.  Seriously, how is he still in it.

Rubio is just your general across the board conservative. Not much else to say about him.

cvb4hqm,1,t3_3m0yez,JoePragmatist,"Sanders- He's by far my preferred choice and I think he's run a hell of a campaign so far.  While I don't agree with him on every issue, he knocks all of my most important issues out of the park(reducing inequality/growing the middle class, getting big money out of politics, climate change, and SCOTUS judges).  As much as I like him though, he still has a ways to go before he can expect to beat...

Clinton- I'll vote for her if I must but I won't be thrilled about it.  Again, referring back to my biggest issues, she does better than any Republican.  I think the email scandal has been blown out of proportion.

Biden- Please don't run.  Somewhat contradictory from a Sanders supporter as he would take a lot more votes from Clinton than from Sanders but he clearly doesn't have it in him and he's never been a great presidential candidate anyway.  On a personal level I like him a lot.

O'Malley- He's run as good a campaign as he can but there's not much room for a candidate not named Clinton, Sanders, or Biden in the Democratic field.  His mayoral record troubles me a bit (Hi Carcetti!) but he's got virtually no shot anyway.

Chafee- Voted no to Iraq.  Great.  Metric system.  I stayed in his beach house in RI once.  Shrug.

Webb- Not even trying.

Lessig- I really like the amendment he's proposing, but I think he's going about it kind of bass ackwards.  Still, I appreciate the admittedly small role he's playing in helping get the word out about corruption.

Trump- I'm so torn about him.  On the one hand, I really appreciate the civil war he's helped to incite inside the GOP, on the other hand his nativist/anti-immigrant schitck has real world consequences that I hate.  He's running a campaign on stupid generalizations and ego.   Something I don't hear mentioned enough: other than his considerable personal public fortune, he is getting a MASSIVE boost from the media covering his every move.  Even in today's post Citizen's United, post-McCutcheon world it'd be really hard to raise the money to saturate the airwaves so thoroughly.

Bush-  Something about him just makes him seem trapped in 2003, or really anywhere in the post-9/11 pre-tea party political landscape.  Maybe it is just that he reminds me so much of W, but he feels already out of date.  Still, I expect him to either get the nomination or be one of the last 2 that don't.

Kasich- Willing to throw a bone to the poor occasionally, which is a breath of fresh air.  If I had to bet money, I'd pick him to win the nomination, but that opinion changes weekly, at least.

Rubio- I think I'm most worried about Rubio, but I can't tell if that's because he's actually dangerous or because he just hasn't been exposed yet.

Paul- My clear favorite among the GOP.  Dead wrong on economics but he's said some stuff about criminal justice reform that I find myself enthusiastically agreeing with.  Like the realism on the drug war front.

Fiorina- That she's even being considered is beyond me as her tenure at both HP and Lucent were marred with failure.  A symptom of the media not willing to call politicians out on their BS.

Walker- I busted out the Lagavulin yesterday when he quit.  I've never been happier watching a politician fail so miserably.  A crooked, mean spirited, bottom-feeding pawn of the oligarchs.

Cruz- A true zealot, both religiously and politically.  Somehow doesn't seem like the biggest jerk in the Republican field.  That is an indictment of the Republican field.

Carson- Religious whack job.  He should really just stick to complex neurosurgery where he does a lot less harm.

Huckabee- Another religious whack job.  He should really just stick to playing the bass where he does a lot less harm.

Christie- Nixonian bully.  I don't trust his crooked ass further than I could throw him.

Santorum- I really thought he'd make a bigger showing.  Total casualty of Trump drinking his milkshake.

Jindal- Failing miserably and widely hated in his own small state.  Not even close to qualified.

Perry- Sorry those new glasses didn't get the job done.

Graham- Unrepentant warmonger.  At least he's honest about it.

Pataki- The GOP's Jim Webb.

I agree more with Bernie Sanders economically, but the biggest victory for either Sanders or Paul is that, in my amateur opinion, they have the respect for the system of government and they respect for the office of the president enough that they won't circumvent the procedures to do what they want.  

I think they're the only genuine candidates running, and either one of them would set a tone for while they're in office that would help the government run more smoothly.  ",2,0,1443020686,1444725182
cvb25j0,1,t3_3m0yez,throwawayeggs,"Trump is the rights version of the perfect american he is the billionaire extravagant who doesn't stand down. He also doesn't drink he doesn't do drugs and instills those ideals in his kids. He is very much a populist who takes the best policies (in my opinion) on many topics, gun control, immigration while is a little hard right I think he is pushing more for just the wall / E-Verify then for deportation of everyone. I support a progressive tax, but i'm an accountant I may be biased. He knows we have to support people in need, will support subsidized healthcare. He might be a prickly candidate but people on the left say he is too conservative and people on the right say he is too liberal anyone who both sides establishment hates is a candidate for me.

Bernie is the lefts version of the perfect american. Guy who doesn't let the dream in his head die. goes to the senate and shows his ideas and never changes them or his morals. Doesn't own a lot just works for the people. I admire him, while I don't agree too much with his economic policies. I agree with his stance on illegal immigration, that it hurts the working class. Most of all I support his work ethic and never letting his dreams die. I wish he would have more bite too him, to attack opponents but if those are his morals than stick to them.

Fiorina, A complete warmonger supports going into a second cold war with Russia not speaking to them again, increasing aggression in the Baltic states, all of which we don't currently need in an increasingly tense world. Feels very forced that she is in the media currently and is likely pushed there to attack Hillary. All while having a bad business record and losing an easy election in California. 

Cruz, Way to religious for me, I understand religion and why people are religious but i don't need that in my politics, his whole campaign is run too much like a sermon to really take his policies seriously. Too much looking right into the camera and talking softly about Iran blowing up the world. 

Hillary, If there was a race that Hillary was on one side I would vote for literally any other person that was running, she is a complete opportunist who will jump at any chance to get ahead monetarily. I am just not a fan of her personality at all, other than that she is just a party line democrat very much in the arms of the establishment. 

Bush, same as Hillary but on the other side of the aisle. I don't know why he is running other than because his brother did and his dad did. If not for that he would not be a notable politician nor would he be in the race still.

Rubio, The establishments Fiorina, Strong defense keep that defense budget high, I don't like that he has the most absentee votes from the senate, If you run maybe you should try being there to defend your positions.

Carson, Soft spoken seems like a nice guy, never has run anything not a business nor an office I am not sure how he has gotten this far, as with Cruz way to religious for me. 

Rand, good guy constitutionalist, don't like the flat/fair tax (again accountant) he doesn't know how to run a campaign as an outsider wish he got more exposure in the race but sadly he will probably be the next one or two to go.

Trump -   He is just a really great artist, and that is why people like him. He is not a politician.

Jeb -  Jeb is like Hillary, I am not impressed at all but it will probably be one of the two 

Carson -  He is a little shy, but given he is the only black candidate in the Republican Party he gets a lot of votes from that, plus, he is not a politician. He is a very capable pediatrician and neurosurgeon but he is too much of a religious extremist so I would not vote for him.

Fiorina -  she was a failiure as CEO,  I wouldn't trust her to be the CEO of the biggest company on Earth: America. But for the same reason as Carson she will get a lot of votes, she is the only woman candidate in the Republican Party, and she is not a politician.

cvbxzav,1,t3_3m0yez,Diddlemesilly,"Paul's my pick. I know he isn't gonna win but as a conservative and libertarian, his views on a small federal government and term limits in congress would really help out in the future.  Congress is a joke, he knows that, he knows the people know that.  He is pro life (as a christian I am also but I understand some arguments on the matter) and is for defunding planned parenthood, I'm not saying pro life is better or worse than pro choice, but almost every other service that planned parenthood provides Paul wants to issue in at government health centers, which is a good idea. I really hope he can get his act together.
his con's are that I don't think he'd be good for the economy, but hey they've all got their problems.

I have no favorite among the democrats, here is why:

Hillary has proven time and time again that she changes her views based on what polls are showing and lets be honest, if anyone else had done the same thing with the email server, they'd be in prison. Oh and there was Benghazi. Oh and she changed her view on the keystone pipeline after receiving millions of dollars in contributions from the supporters of it.

My view on Sanders is this: He thinks promising free college (which obama did) and legalizing weed (which obama did) is enough to get him elected. This is because he knows what appeals to millennials and that's the vote he is trying to obtain, if he can actually get millennials out in the booth he may win the vote but the femi-nazi millennials are already voting for hillary so he can count them out.

Biden doesn't stand a chance in my opinion just because of his role in the Obama administration, but he is the democrat I favor most. He's a realistic down to earth guy.

Every other democrat and republican is either way to religious (as a christian I lean right but I understand the concept of seperation of church and state) or just not worth mentioning  ",1,0,1443049544,1444725185
cvbfaam,1,t3_3m0yez,Cycloptichornclown,"*Sanders* - Complete joke.  The only reason that he has made it this far is because the media doesn't take him seriously and won't question him on his policies.  If he had half the scrutiny that Rubio, Bush or Trump had, he would have collapsed weeks ago.   The good news for him is that if he wins the nomination, he will lose hard.  He will become the face of the Democrats tea party that will do well in 2018. 

*Clinton* - Terrifyingly corrupt.  The closer we get to the primaries, the more you will see come out.  Cattle futures bribes, uranium sale after they donated to her, her acting on behalf of UBS to the Treasury department for a tax dispute right after they donated millions to her, foreign donors in the Clinton foundation, email deletion and hiding, etc.  She also will start attacking Sanders as she falls in the polls and he rises, which will be interesting. 

*Biden* - Most likely to jump in as Clinton collapses.  He knows that nominating Bernie will cause the Democrats to lose hard. 

*Trump* - Loser.  He will be gone soon, no point discussing. 

*Carson* - Smart man, terrible politician.  He had some support and lost it all already by allowing his words to be twisted.

*Rubio* - Gaining now, smart man and good politician.  He will most likely get VP.  He shouldn't have dropped the senate race, but good for him for making it clear he wants to win. 

*Kasich* - Not going to win, doesn't really matter.  He is hoping that everyone else fights each other and he is left looking good.  Won't happen.

*Bush* - Will win the nomination.  He knows its a marathon and knows that quick movement in the GOP polls is dangerous.  Better to be competent, well funded, and tactical without demanding press or making boneheaded moves (*like Clinton trying to win airwaves with claiming she would unilaterally limit biotech patents*).
