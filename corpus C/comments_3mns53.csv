cvgskq9,0,t1_cvgpznb,JimMarch,"The single craziest bill I personally saw was from just before I was hired as a lobbyist.

I was running a website where I exposed the fact that sheriffs and police chiefs were selling gun carry permits for campaign contributions out at least issuing on a crony basis.  In California, New York, New Jersey, Mass and a few others gun carry permits are issued in a ""discretionary"" basis with law enforcement brass able to personally pick who gets them.  Which leads to shit like this:

http://www.ninehundred.net/~equalccw/colafrancescopapers.pdf

http://www.ninehundred.net/~equalccw/oaklandzen.html

...and so on.  By 2002 I got my ass thrown out of the NRA.  Why?  Because I kept going after Republican sheriffs, and that bothered the California GOP who told the NRA to order me to knock it off.

In 2002 I asked a very dangerous question.  I filed a public records request with the state DOJ asking for their central archives of records of CCW denial - from every agency at once.  This could have blown the lid off a lot of shit, including the holy grail - proof of racial bias in how these permits are handled.  (If you realize as I do that cops have issues with ""driving while black"", how do think cops feel about ""packing a gun while black""?)

So Cal-DOJ lost their shit and got a law passed allowing them to **destroy** The very records I asked for.  Yeah.  Fuckers passed a law to screw me personally...and the NRA helped.  Heres the collision on video:

https://youtu.be/cPDZjQAHeY0

Note the role of Ed Worley, same guy who told me to STFU about corrupt GOP sheriffs.

Sidenote: you know how us gunnies won two US Supreme Court cases in 2008 (Heller) and 2010 (McDonald)?  Those weren't NRA cases.  They were run by the Second Amendment Foundation...I worked as a lobbyist for their political wing, CCRKBA.  Some of their California lawsuits have used my old data from 2005 and prior.  Funniest part: the NRA's sole involvement in McDonald was to ensure it didn't also help gay marriage along!  Not even kidding.",31,0,1443442643,1444723055

cvhnefu,0,t1_cvh01dc,JimMarch,"I'm Occupy alumni myself - Tucson.  We had zero incidents of police violence against protestors.  We also ran an armed camp, and I personally made sure Tucson PD knew early on that (as allowed by Arizona law) there were guns in camp.  Six at peak that I know of, probably others.  I was the most ""out"" gunnie there with this under my jacket (in that holster I might add):

Two days after the camp started there was a large group that made it to a Tucson city council meeting to talk about it...200 or so of us.  Under AZ law the city council can declare chambers a no-gun-zone, but to do so the cops outside at the metal detectors have to have a lockbox system you can leave your boomthing in.  So I checked that monster, in the holster.  TPD were visibly shitting themselves seeing what is basically a ""lefty"" piece...note what's on the holster and gear holder :).  It's basically a paradigm shift without a clutch (credit to Scott Adams for that wonderful phrase).

As an aside, that's not that gun's final form.   It's evolved a lot since, and is now the only street-practical magazine-fed revolver that I know of...""Maurice the FrankenRuger"", so named because ""some people call it The Space Cowboy"" (Steve Miller Band reference).

In the state I recently worked in, there is a large porn studio that wanted to donate to the Democrats, but having that on the filing report wouldn't look great, so they had the most liberal member in one of the safest districts take the donations.

The Presidential campaigns still do this as well, especially in early Caucus/Primary states, usually to help secure endorsements.

It's also interesting to note that in some states an individual can have as many PACs as you want, meaning if you're a donor and want to donate to State Representative Jones and you've reached the state limit for their campaign, donate to their 1,2,5, or 20 other PACs and you've found a legal way around the limits.",6,0,1443447872,1444723067
