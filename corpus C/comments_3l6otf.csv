When I was with a local Habitat for Humanity chapter we would have people offer to donate vacant homes to us. Sometimes we took them but often we realized that it would cost us more to get a 'free"" home than the home would be worth.

None of the above. Having a roommate is not the end of the world. The poster you replied to suggested people use roommates as a way to be more financially stable. Which is a great suggestion.

Living with roommates makes it easier to pay off other outstanding debts. Having roommates reduces what I pay in rent freeing up my income to be spent on things I enjoy; going to sporting events, going out to eat, seeing a movie. 

But you'd rather take one sentence out of context to try and attack me personally.

Okay maybe not ""points"", I'll give you that. I did mention my reasoning for why I have roommates (which was not defensive or angry)    
 -Living with roommates allows for better finical decisions; such as paying off student debt, auto-loans, medical expenses, and other bills.   
-Living with roommates also allows you to have more ""discretionary spending"" for non-essential items such as a big screen TV. 

>OK, maybe not threatened or angry, but defensive maybe?   

Where I was being defensive. I never came close to that. I never said ""I have roommates so they have to have them too!"". I never tried to justify my life style by basing it on theirs. I said I make enough to live on my own, but choose not to because of the benefits. I was trying to imply that those who make less should make the same decision, as it is a good option. 

I clearly stated I could live without roommates. Again, you're trying to make me say something I never did. 

>Why is it a problem to you that people who work at McDonalds might want to live without roommates? Have a cell phone? 

Nothings wrong with wanting those things. 

Housing is expensive, there's no doubt about it. Even living in an apartment housing is expensive. Living on your own, is not cheap.  and should be only an option when you are ready for it. 

Just like housing there's nothing wrong with wanting a cellphone. There's nothing wrong with having a cellphone. But having the newest iPhone, or galaxy with a huge data plan could be. 

If housing is the main issue, why make employers pay more? Why not make all of the landlords have a forced rent price that cannot exceed certain values? 

If people need cellphones, why not just federally mandate that citizen be issued one? 

>And some people are working very hard to barely get by.

Housing is not the main issue at all, it's the low wages. Labor is a cost of doing business.  Just like water and electricity. If the price electricity goes up, what does a business do?  Perhaps conserve electricity, sure.  But if they're not wasting it already and their power consumption is a significant portion of their business costs, then they'll have to raise their prices, right?   Is it *fair* the price of electricity goes up? No.  So why does everyone react differently when we suggest the cost of labor needs to increase?  I mentioned this before, we've had a minimum wage since 1938, it's been raised 22 times and not once has it caused havoc on the economy.   Meanwhile, it's been proven to improve the lives of people at the lower end of the pay scale.

There is almost an unlimited supply of global labor and it will be very hard to achieve full employment in our country.

If it was me and I’m sure many won’t agree, I would increase domestic spending on public works and other infrastructure and green energy projects like installing solar panels everywhere, insulating homes etc. These things cannot be outsourced and short of ripping up trade agreements and barring US companies from outsourcing labor I don’t see much choice if we want to get to true full employment.

People are getting tied up with the idea that there is some ideal minimum lifestyle when there simply isn't.  Some people should not be able to afford to live without roommates, like those who haven't graduated high school.  Some people should not be able to afford a car.  Not everyone can afford a new luxury car, and that's also ok.  You simply cannot have a competitive and innovative society where everyone's outcome is equal.

Between 1970 and 2000 prices nearly quadrupled. A shovel that cost $10 in 1970 cost $37 dollars in 2000. Minimum wage went from $1.60 (current dollars) in 1970 to $5.10 (current dollars) in 2000.

We used to let the market decide what wages to pay and then we realized that way sucked, so we changed the way we do it.  

There is no inherent virtue in letting the market decide wages, and its not about fairness.  Minimum wage is about maintaining a certain level of society that we as a group have decided we prefer vs letting the markets dictate wages.  Much in the same way that we enforce safety standards in the work place rather than letting the market dictate what safety standards should be.  

I've noticed that a lot of the arguments against raising the minimum wage are more about arguing against the concept of minimum wage itself, rather than on the merits of the actual proposal.  We decided a long time ago that we want to live in a society with a minimum wage, that discussion is over.

You are correct. There is a virtue in free people making their own decisions. In the places where a McDonalds meal will either be served via total automation or will average $10 or more per person to pay the mandated wage - what will happen. Would you choose to eat at McDonalds for the same price you pay for Applebees or Chilis? No - I would not either. All of the McDonalds workers you helped with force will lose their jobs.

>I've noticed that a lot of the arguments against raising the minimum wage are more about arguing against the concept of minimum wage itself, rather than on the merits of the actual proposal.

Here is the truth about minimum wage. It has to be forced up by government because no wage can keep up with the rise in prices. If there was a sound monetary policy wage would never be an issue.

1. Stop expecting that starter jobs should feed a family of four or even one person.  It's a false expectation.

2. Measure people instead of jobs. The wealth inequality measure is a snapshot statistic of a receptionist job then and now adjusted for inflation. Yes - a receptionist job from 1985 pays the same wage now which is really what you should expect. The job has not changed and become cheaper to achieve through automation. What is not measured is that fact that 99.999% of all receptionists from 1985 are no longer receptionists. The receptionist from 1985 has worked for six companies and is now the CFO of Hallmark and makes $300k a year.

3. The Federal Reserve's target inflation is between 1-2%. Change the management of money (or end it) to have the inflation goal be between -1% and 1% and go back to the pre 1980 measure of inflation.

Unless all minimum wage workers in the country are earning exactly what their market value is right now, then companies do pay more money, and theres no magic about it.  

Companies have a desire to operate here because there is more value here than anywhere else in the world, with more potential to earn money than anywhere else in the world.  The fact that we have minimum wage earners now proves that the value of operating here outweighs the cost of paying the minimum wage (at the current level, at least).  

Even certain states have lower minimum wages than others, but we don't see companies flocking there to save a few bucks on wages.
