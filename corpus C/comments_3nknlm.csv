If it's the same candidate, I would then look at the next one down the list.  In order of who's primary is first.  Until I had 6.

I'd reserve three spots for the top three candidates based on national avg. polls since the last debate, if they didn't make the list somehow.

I'd then take the top three candidates who have already received the most endorsements from electoral college members of any state, if they didn't make the list some how.

So all told there is a possibility of having 6-12 on the stage but it would likely be around 6-7.

All others would be placed in the under card debate.",2,0,1444066857,1444718086

I might even go slightly farther to suggest that in addition to your 'endorsement' rule exactly as you state it -- that you also (automatically) take whomever the candidate is who ISN'T already on the list, who has the MOST endorsements (meaning out of all those not already on the list, that you automatically include the one who has the most endorsements).

I'm not trying to suggest there's necessarily any magic in endorsements, but in a world where there's a big schism within a party (as is the case with Republicans), I wouldn't want to automatically kick out practically all the establishment candidates -- since they'll be the ones who are disproportionately left when the non-establishment candidates begin to falter one-by-one (as is always the case).

Again, this is just for the purposes of who to include in a debate.

Second, have regional debates first that then get promoted up in the manner of a sports bracket - or in the manner of a caucus, for that matter. This will multiply the total number of candidates.

Good luck with that.  Our ""first-past-the-post"" voting system almost guarantees that there will only be two viable parties.  You'd have to practically change to a parliamentary system to get more viable parties into the system.

cvpwzly,1,t3_3nknlm,aussiemourinho,"It could never happen, but I think that winnowing down the field to a select group based on ideology and their current realistic chances of being on the ticket would make for interesting and informative viewing. I would include Bush, Trump, Rubio, Cruz, Kasich and Fiorina, leaving out the rest for the following reasons: 

- Cruz represents the Tea Party and Evangelical wing of the party, and therefore Huckabee, Carson Jindal and Santorum, who have similar platforms, miss out, as Cruz has the most money and the best organisation of the five. He's probably also the most electable of the group in a general election (even though he isn't particularly electable). 

- Rubio represents the young, crossover Tea Party/Establishment wing of the party, and is the most electable candidate in a general election, so he's in. There's some crossover with Chris Christie, who, along with Lindsey Graham shares his hawkish Foreign Policy views, therefore Chrisite and Graham miss out. 

- Trump is currently leading the polls, and despite what many people say, I believe that he could win the nomination. It's not likely, but he could. He also represents the 'business' candidates, knocking Fiorina out of my debate. 

- Bush represents the traditional, establishment wing of the party, and is the 'safe choice', much like Romney and McCain were in the previous two general elections. He's not going to win a general in a landslide, but he's sensible, mature, and moderate enough to push Hillary Clinton to the wire in a general. There's some corssover here with Christie, who already missed out due to his similarities with Rubio. 

- Kasich is the final candidate in my ideal debate even though he shares some similarities with Bush, as an establishment candidate. He is differentiated, however, by having the best record of all the candidates in the race (including the democrats), and also be being farthest to the left of the Republican field (with the exception of Pataki). 

The only two candidates not mentioned above are Gilmore (sorry buddy, but you might as well go home now), and Rand Paul. I leave Rand Paul out because he is, in my view, unelectable in *this* election cycle, given the turmoil in the Middle East. Many on the right consider Foreign Policy to be the most important issue at the moment, and given that Paul's foreign policy is more abhorrent to many Republican's than Obama's, I think that a lot of the base would stay at home were he to be the nominee, so I haven't included him.

cvp0x8d,1,t3_3nknlm,Blarglephish,"Omitting candidates from debates is a form of censorship. IMO, you have to have a venue that allows all of them to be on stage, in front of cameras. Anything less, and the debate hosts are censoring candidates, and helping skew polling for certain candidates.

But there are too many candidates! How do we host a venue where everyone gets on stage, and allow each candidate enough time to have a debate worthy of merit, and not have it run 4+ hours?

This is problem that the NFL has already solved with ""Redzone""-style programming. Take the first Republican debate as an example (back when they had sixteen candidates). Rank each candidate 1-16 in terms of their popularity (from polling data), and create 4-candidate ""divisions"" based on rankings. Each division will then have a isolated, 4-candidate debate with their own moderators, simultaneously. Each debate will be filmed in full (then posted on youtube later, so people can watch the full debates for candidates that interest them). Have a central studio on a one to two minute delay from the live streams talking about what is going on in each of the debates, and flipping the central feed back and forth depending on whenever a candidate has a good line or makes a good point (analogous to how Redzone switches between scoring plays for different teams). The division of candidates by poll rankings ensures that each division has at least one ""high-profile"" candidate (a Trump, Bush, Rubio type, etc.) and at least one of the lesser candidates (think Graham, Jindal, Fiorina, etc.) to get an evenly distributed mix.
