I see so many starry-eyed Sanders voters that think that it can all happen, and that we can pay for this massive increase in spending.

Politicians like Sanders are not new- just study history a little bit.  They tend to draw in the young, naive, and others who haven't spent enough time studying history to know that their promises will probably not be met.

I'm not trying to be combative here, just asking for a sincere discussion.  When politicians promise you the world, don't you at least become a little suspicious?

then don't ask a leading question with a condescending tone. you can literally ask that question about any candidate that anyone supports. it's a really lazy question that is meant to take a shot at sanders's supporters while lumping them all into 1 group that intently trusts him. you probably saw a few comments on reddit and assumed that all supporters feel that way and can be grouped. 

i'm sorry, but i don't give my time to answer posts like that on here. ask a more specific question that doesn't generalize all supporters as one group of people that all think the same, and i'll consider answering.
