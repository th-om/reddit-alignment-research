cv333dx,1,t3_3l4c5p,TheNaBr,"The two metaphors sound like they are addressing different things.  The tide one is generally saying that as wealthy is generated, everyone gets wealthier together.  Your human body metaphor is more about how the economy functions in general and then you're applying your metaphor to justify your political stance.

cv33s0j,0,t1_cv333dx,improbable_humanoid,"The tide one suggests that cutting taxes for the wealthy causes them to invest their money into businesses which create jobs, which is actually backasswards as to how economics actually works. 

Jobs are created because people have money to spend, which means people will create companies to create and sell things to these people, and other people will create companies to sell things to these companies, which means people get paid money that gets spent, creating more jobs, and so on. It's a circulatory process, which is why a circulatory system is a better metaphor than a tide (which of course, is powered by the moon, but I digress).

My political stance just happens to be based more on economics rather than emotion or rhetoric.",-6,0,1442371228,1444728074

I don't get that from the metaphor.

cv335ez,1,t3_3l4c5p,houinator,"Seems a bit of a weird anthology, because there is nothing preventing the wealthy from spending their money, at least to an extent that would qualify as cutting off.  Also, if we look at energy rather than blood flow, the brain uses 20% of the energy despite only taking up 2% of the body mass, which seems more analogous to our current situation.

The economy also has several abilities the human body doesn't, such as the ability to grow replacement parts.  In the human body, if a part gets seriously injured, you still keep it around even if it slows the rest of the body down, because it generally can't be replaced.  However, if we could grow newer and better replacement body parts when one got injured, we might consider letting the damaged ones go.  The economy largely lost the horse and buggy industry once it couldn't compete with cars, but I don't view that as a bad thing.

No, the 1% owns as much wealth as the bottom half. The average CEO makes 380 times as much as the average worker. If the top 2% owned 20% of the wealth, the economy would be a lot healthier. ",-4,0,1442371320,1444728074

cv363xh,0,t1_cv355rh,improbable_humanoid,"My point is that some income redistribution is necessary because the economy won't function if people don't have money to spend, and because the system tends to move in the direction of inequality when left alone.
