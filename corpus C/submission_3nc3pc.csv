3nc3pc,Why do Americans care so much about constitutionality?,48,EmeraldIbis,"From what I have observed, most Americans seem to have an almost religious reverence for the constitution. It seems like in pretty much any disagreement, if one side can prove that what they're suggesting is constitutionally protected then they automatically win.

Let me give you an example. I've heard many people saying ""Oh, our right to possess firearms is a constitutional right"". And I've heard others saying ""No, no, no, the intention behind that provision is only to allow state militias, blah, blah blah"". Well... Who cares? The constitution was written by a bunch of men over 200 years ago. They might have been great men, but all men make mistakes. Why can't you just say ""I know the constitution says that, but it's wrong."" It seems to me like a no-brainer, but it seems like a lot of Americans would see that as almost heretical...

Why so much attachment to the constitution? And do you think it's healthy?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3nc3pc/why_do_americans_care_so_much_about/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443874397,1444719895
