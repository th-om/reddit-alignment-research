The writers are biased just like anyone else, but they are not beholden to a particular candidate. The newspaper exists independently of the election. The weight the editorial endorsement of the Post carries, and indeed its continued existence, depends on the paper's ability to attract readers. It's a two-way street, the paper both influences and is influenced by public opinion. 

Even if you look at less venerable newsmedia organizations there is a distinction. Fox News and MSNBC are both unabashedly biased, and more political theater than news, but the pundits are paid for bringing in viewers not voters. The way Fox has let Trump soak up all the airtime while simultaneously attacking him shows that they are more concerned with entertainment than helping or hindering any particular candidate. The networks help candidates on their end of the spectrum by riling up the base, but the purpose is to keep them watching.

Contrast that with a SuperPAC, which exists solely to advance the interests of a particular candidate and is influenced only by a handful of wealthy donors. Since Rick Perry dropped out, donors to his SuperPAC want their money back. 

We must be very cautious about censoring political speech, and I can understand the Supreme Court being uncomfortable with the way the FEC was doing it. At the same time, I think in the interest of fair elections we *should* regulate the money flowing into campaigns, and SuperPACs make that impossible.

We're talking about social-welfare organizations not intended for use as political devices being used as such to obscure the origins of political funding, when transparency is something we should absolutely value in the electoral process.

The electoral process as it currently stands does not work without money. Vast sums are required, and the higher the office, the more money needed for a successful campaign. Soliciting donations has been described as a part- or full-time occupation for members of Congress; the short re-election cycles of Representatives and the high costs of Senate elections mean that they need to spend a significant portion of each election cycle making sure they have enough cash ready for the next.

We, as a people, are owed transparency in this. At the local, state, and national level, these men and women are fundamentally those who we have chosen to represent our interests, and the higher up the scale you go in terms of the influence these people hold, the more beholden to their sources of funding these people *of necessity* become. Short of *massive* changes to the way we handle elections, changes that I do not expect to occur in any rational near-term sense, this is not going to change; that being the case, the people they represent are absolutely owed at least that degree of transparency.

Both require a specialized interest and therefore cause a biased.  Media outlets should strive to be unbiased so articles where a reporter endorses a candidate should be looked at as unprofessional.  But as you've mentioned [already](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lflkp/people_against_superpacs_andor_the_scotus_ruling/cv5w1aj), media outlets have no reason to remain neutral, other than the violation of the trust the public places in them.  SUPERPACs allow for more money to be raised than an even playing field would allow.  This retards the common man (read lower middle class or below) efforts from being a political influence.

The belief that any person can become a politician if they are appealing enough is all but crushed to nothing when compared to the power of advertising, misinformation and the severity of how little informed voters can be.

Additionally, because SuperPACs (or for that matter lobbist groups) allow for an anonymity that is simply absurd (IMO), you have no idea if a company has endorsed a candidate or not.  Meaning you have no idea if that candidate can be influenced by that company when it comes to regulating interests.

If a single company wants to publicly endorse a campaign... great! but it should do so as a single person would, not as an industry through a PAC or Lobbyist Group.  

Why? (you may ask) Because industries who work as a united front in the manner just mentioned, have unique ability to hold the US economy hostage that no single common voter can.

Honestly, I'm for a rather extreme solution to this matter.  I think the only advertising any politician should be able to do is on a single webpage set up by the federal or state government, depending on whether they are running for national or state level election.  They could place their stances/opinions on that page. If people like that candidate's views and opinions, articles, sound bites, vines, tweets, snap chats, clips and whatever else the internet community comes up with as a a method of communicating, then when they're reading up about that candidate they can say they endorse that candidate using their voter registration number that is protected through anonymity but can still be verified as real person.  This effectively allows for incredibly accurate polling numbers come primary/debate season.  

You could also use this feature to say that you must receive endorsement of at least x number of registered voters to be considered a ""legitimate"" candidate, which means that candidate would receive front page status and actually appear in the debates.

Unfortunately this could never be allowed, as there is way too much money involved in political advertising.

So lets try a compromise that I've suggested before:

lets call it the LEAD income tax:  Legislative Elect Accountability of Deductive income tax

Limit all campaign fund raising to a flat amount. Once it gets to that point, all additional funds must be given back to the contributor or given to a non political charity (i.e. No entity that supports a political campaign or lobby) of the candidates choosing.

What if we say the cut off is around 1 mil for local,1.5 mil for state, and 5 mil for national set to increase at cost of inflation every three years? 

Then what if we made it so that the fundraising includes those campaign organization that the candidate endorses to campaign for them?

I think we'd see a lot more politicians in that smaller tax bracket and far more interest in human policies instead of corporate policies. 

And since these laws only work when there are mandatory sentences... (politicians love mandatory sentences). The min punishment rules should be: 

* any violation discovered above 2,000 dollars up to 48 hrs before the election date will result in double the excess amount fined to the candidate themself. 

* Any violations found after that point, would be charged triple the amount and call for a special reelection to be financed on the guilty cadiate's own dime (e.g. No fundraising). Therefore it is in the candidate's best interest to submit their fundraising report sooner rather then later as accurately as possible.

All fundraising must be made public to the investigating agencies no later than 2 months prior to the election or face a 10% fine on all funds raised. 

The investigative agency's report would be due by 3 months after the initial fundraising report submission stating clearly to the layman and public whether or not the candidate violated fundraising restrictions. 

Agencies who fail to provide the report may be sued for defamation of character.

Once submitted, candidates or the PAC they endorse would not be allowed to conduct further fundraising or risk steep penalties once discovered with no statues of limitations. 

All fines would go towards ethics violation training at all government agencies and middle school and elementary school funding split 20/60 respectively at the level at which the candidate is running (I.e. Local, state or national).

The remaining 20% would go towards the cost of the investigation and the department that either discovers the violation or succeds in prosecuting the candidate. 

Investigations would be run jointly by the IRS, Secret Service, and FBI. With, ideally, the FBI being the prosecuting arm and the Secret Service and IRS being the investigative.

Let's see how they like their own version of civil asset forfeiture

Edit1: the funding for the investigations not resulting in fines would come from a small .001% on all elected official's income.",5,0,1442602831,1444727204

In such an ideal potential setting, theoretically everyone's voice would be equal; the problem we see today, of voices carrying a staggeringly inequal weight based purely on the amount of money each one has behind it to push it to the proper ears, simply might not exist beyond citizens expressing their views to their representatives.

Exercising the privilege to vote is more satisfying to humans than understanding policy, and that will remain true for as long as we're human.  

For that reason, I think education-based campaign reform is doomed. It's not a matter of getting each voter to spend half an hour reading up on the platforms of the candidates; the average American doesn't understand enough civics to tell you how the *current* tax code works, mostly because it isn't important to their life. I might be in favor of changing school curricula to require more civics education, but it's difficult to do apolitically and won't bear fruit for 10-20 years. And I don't see an adult education program ever getting off the ground. Grownups have bills to pay. It might happen if you offered a free civics course tied to a tax credit, but there aren't enough teachers around willing and able to teach it without a political bent.  

I think controlling the frame of the election as much as legally possible is the more feasible method of reform. Regulate political speech the way we regulate speech about medicines. Accredit pollsters that meet standards of statistical rigor and incentivize them to become accredited. Cap advertising rates before an election.  

Sure, limiting one outlet is going to drive demand in another, but the broadcast networks do have a much larger viewership than cable or paytv shows.

cv649hw,0,t1_cv5w1aj,MemeticParadigm,"IMO, the problem is not a lack of neutrality, it's the ability to dump unlimited funds into mouthpieces that lack a persistent reputation.

If Bill O'Reilly, or Bill Maher, or Walmart, or any other entity with a persistent reputation/history wants to publicly endorse a candidate, that's fine, and I see no problem with them spending as much money or airtime or w/e resource they possess as they want telling you *why* they endorse that candidate, and why you should too. It's fine *because* those endorsements come with a meaningful context - the reputation of the endorser, which means you can identify potential conflicts of interest, ulterior motives, a history of deception, etc. - all the things which tell you when to be wary about accepting the arguments being made in the endorsement at face value.

The problem is when the Koch brothers can spend half a billion dollars pushing an agenda that benefits them personally, without the viewer ever being able to identify that the *real* context of the message is actually the Koch's advocating on their own behalf, because that half a billion dollars translates into 10 different entities with names like ""Citizens United"" and ""Americans for Freedom"", who have no previous reputation and don't have to worry about future reputation, being an endorsement mouthpiece for the Koch's but trying to give the appearance that they are *really* advocating on behalf of the average American.

My answer to that is that spending on political speech *beyond* a certain level should *not* be permitted anonymously. If you spend more than X$ per year on political advocacy, every bit of media produced with that money needs to end or begin with ""Paid for by [Walmart/Koch Industries/David Soros/etc.]"" so that people actually know, *by default*, which entities are amplifying which political advocacy, and judge that advocacy *within* that context.",5,0,1442600194,1444727225

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC#Opinions_of_the_Court  please read the decision/dissent.  

It absolutely opens up room for further conversation but the most important difference between a Super PAC and a media outlet distributing ads endorsing/attacking a candidate is that the Super PACs sole and entire purpose for existing is to do just that.  The burden of finding the truth will always come down to the viewers/voters and having a well educated populace would better that cause but what you're asking is of the impact of Super PACs vs that of traditional media (run for/as a business or a blog type.)  The difference between the Washington Post or NY Times publishing an article/attack ad is that they have a reputation to uphold whereas a Super PAC does not (not their own anyway).  Other comments in this thread mention how News sources don't care about seeming neutral and I'd say that doesn't make my point any less true.  Fox is right wing, MSNBC is left, even their colors are red and blue on their websites.  If Fox started publishing stories all about Bernie Sanders and MSNBC became pro Bush/Carson their main viewer base would be offended and they'd lose ratings and money.  A SuperPAC has to change to fit the goals of the corporation(s) its run by.  This isn't to say those goals won't be static for years or decades.  A SuperPAC can also reform under a new name and it wouldn't change a thing in the eyes of the average voter.  The only superPAC with any dinner table name recognition is Citizens United.  
We can pretend that it's the people who make up the corporation getting together and deciding to donate to the PAC to further their politician of choice's chances but we all know how it actually works. The oligarchy we live in allows those at the top to decide how these large sums of money are distributed and they will always be spent to further the financial goals of the corporation/investors.  It's not some group of 50 people all working together to make our lives worse it's the couple thousand people who have all the money and all the say in the matter working to further their own financial goals without regards for much else.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think the more worrying part of the decision is the implications into corruption and not so much the misinformation spread by media.  SuperPACs have mechanisms to reduce transparency in the campaign funding process and it's this that worries people the most.  It allows corporations to bribe politicians plain and simple.  If they don't do what they're told there's hundreds of others with similar qualifications who will.  The difference between this and traditional media (as a billionaire/corporation could certainly just hire thousands of journalists to spread information through other means) is it provides a legal mechanism with a perverse incentive for corruption whereas voicing your opinion (spending money) through traditional media outlets doesn't allow for the same level of organization that a SuperPAC does, vastly reducing its impact on the average voter. 

TLDR/ELI5: Voicing your opinion through traditional media is like hiring a bunch of day 10 boot camp soldiers to go to war for you.  They're cheap, hyped up and looking for action but not exactly the most organized, productive force.  A SuperPAC is like sending the Navy Seals.  They're very expensive, well trained, organized and effective..and no one knows who they are or what they're really up to.

The SCOTUS exists to interpret laws so it's like they can only answer questions that are brought up to them, they can't see issues facing the country and take action on their own behalf.  I'm of the opinion that this debate is far from over and the question will be posed in the right way in a future case where the SC will make a decision overruling Citizens United, not overturning it directly.
Wanted to add after seeing /u/minorsaint's comment about when superPACs exist normal voters don't have a say.  It's like that meme from the Incredibles where if everyone has superpowers no one does.  We'd be much better off here in the real world where no one has any more power over the other.  That concept plays two parts in this debate.  When the rich and powerful people/corporations can donate millions of dollars the average voter becomes powerless.  Also, when candidates can receive enormous sums of money to further their reelection campaign, the ones that do not receive that money become powerless, illustrating again the perverse incentives for corruption created by the SCOTUS decision and existence of superPACs.",5,0,1442595406,1444727228
cv6eq44,1,t3_3lflkp,Rubin0,"There is a massive difference between a SuperPac and an editorial board submitting content. In my opinion, the most important distinction is the willingness of the audience. If an editorial board is going to give their political opinion, who is going to see it? Only those who are specifically reading the political editorial section of that newspaper. SuperPacs buy ad time on television and solicit via mail, email, boots on the ground, etcetera. The people who will see these endorsements are usually not actively searching for them.

The second difference is reach and accountability. SuperPacs allow for interests to inject their opinions into elections far away. Recently, the majority of state elections had their funding come from outside their respective states. I have a serious problem with that. This is compounded when the donors to superpacs are kept secret. It is 100% possible that foreign interests have been spending money to influence U.S. Elections.

The final issue is scale. The truth is that money is effective in politics. SuperPacs transformed the field into a nuclear arms race. Though there have been some exceptions, massive amounts of money will lead to an advantage and can only be countered with another pile. In order to build the war chests necessary to maintain such a campaign, politicians are forced to fundraise like never before. Senators spend roughly 3/4 of their time fundraising (npr had the fact but I can't look it up on my phone right now). Is it naive for me to believe that this is a corrupting influence?

Going to the specific court case, I think that the Hillary Clinton film was perfectly legal but the decision was left far too open and allowed for the creation of tools that went far behind even the intention of the court.

The law has very specific guidelines where donations and speech can be limited if they corrupt **or create the appearance** of corruption. Scalia's interpretation of they passage is that money is only corrupting if there is a concrete ""quid pro quo"" bribe. I find that assertion to be absurd.

For the above reasons, I am extremely against SuperPacs. ",2,0,1442617712,1444727232

For what it's worth, I do think that Citizens United gets disproportionate attention compared to what it actually deserves.  If Citizens United happened, but SpeechNow didn't, we wouldn't have ended up with SuperPACs and campaign finance advocates probably wouldn't have latched onto Citizens United (or at least not for long).  It took both decisions. 

That being said Citizens United shouldn't be considered irrelevant, because if the majority opinions on Citizens United had been worded differently to apply differently to money, it may prevented SpeechNow from creating SuperPACs.

I'm not opposed to them airing their content when they want.

If you think newspaper endorsements are *anything* like a Super PAC, I'd be confident in saying that you've either never worked anywhere near the top of a campaign or you're being purposefully disingenuous to defend a practice you know is improper. 

A media institution exists independently of elections. It has a reader base. Those people chose to pay money (or at least pick up) the paper or open the site. It can be reasonably expected that they know to some extent what will be waiting for them editorially when they do. If I am a NYT subscriber, it would not be surprising to read an editorial endorsing a Democrat come November. 

A Super PAC exists to funnel money into campaign without limits. A candidate will set up a Super PAC, a couple of very wealthy donors will pour a few million into it, and that money buys ads, lit, merch, and finances the ground game. They put their resources out into the world with the explicit goal of making it appear indistinguishable from the campaign. 

If you really think these two vastly different institutions are even remotely comparable, answer me this: has the New York Times ever paid staffers to canvass for a candidate? Has the Huffington Post ever put an ad on heavy rotation in Ohio for a candidate? Has any media outlet ever dedicated it's every last ounce of money and effort to electing a candidate? 

This isn't that hard guys. With Super PAC's in the game, you have no reason to ever donate money to a candidate because the contributions of voters don't matter.
