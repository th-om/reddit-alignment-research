cvi3bxl,1,t3_3mu452,lollersauce914,"> The Millennial generation (ages 18-35, give or take) is largely ignored by the older generations. 

Given that nearly every board room in America is hell bent on selling to and hiring ""the millenials"" I take issue with this assertion.

> The importance of this election cannot be overstated, as it could decide an entire generations allegiance.

I don't think that's how age cohorts' voting patterns work...

> Currently, Millennials mostly identify as Independent, but tend to vote Democrat. I believe this is because the democrat/social issues are cooler and more exciting to support. In other words, saving the planet and legalization of marijuana is more exciting than lower taxes and deregulation.


I think this is a pretty insulting and infantilizing way of characterizing political views of millenials. Many millenials identify as libertarians like yourself and the majority that *are* liberal don't simply take the stances they do because they're ""cooler.""

> Older Millennials grew up with 8 years of Bush -- and plenty of war to go around. Younger Millennials only know Obama -- and still hear about constant problems in the middle east. Millennials agree on one thing: we do not want America to be the world's police.

Uh, I'm 25, voted for Obama twice, and feel that the US has an enormous role to play in global security. I'm hardly the only one to feel that way. 

> Millennials also grew up with a terrible economy, high cost of living, inflated student loan debt, and a pitiful job market. And with all that, Millennials are still optimistic and have an entrepreneurial spirit. As soon as Millennials experience the unrelenting force that is government regulation, they realize that barriers to entry aren't helping the younger generations at all. Want to start a food truck? Better get licensed. Want to be a dental hygienist? Better pay the government for your licensing and classes every year or so. Want to take an Uber downtown? Better hurry before the government shuts it down.

Yeah, so do you want to cite some statistics here? I, in my job, literally just ran a survey that asks how citizens would feel about incorporating private ride sharing like Uber into public transit and how sharing services should be regulated. A huge majority across all age groups favored the idea and felt that sharing economy services should be regulated as similar non-sharing businesses in the same industry are. These views did not vary by age.

> This election is very important because 8 more years of terrible could sway an entire generation in one direction. A bad Democrat president could produce a generation of Republicans, and vice-versa. The same could be said for a good candidate from either party. What would happen if we have Bush? What would happen if we have Clinton? What would happen if we have [candidate]?

Again, this is not how voting patterns of age cohorts work.

> I was at an Americans for Prosperity event recently, and I did my own unofficial polling of hundreds of people.

Some got terrible degrees with no job demand, sure.  It didn't help that the older generations and the government were telling them that ""you can be anything you want to be"" and ""you have to go to college after high school"".  There are tons of problems with our higher-education system.  The point is that it's getting harder and harder to get well-paying salaried positions and become a home owner.

Two of the examples of ""government barriers"" you cite in your original post disturb me. Food safety and medical licensing regulations aren't arbitrary. They exist for a reason.

> Some got terrible degrees with no job demand, sure. It didn't help that the older generations and the government were telling them that ""you can be anything you want to be"" and ""you have to go to college after high school"".

So again, it's not their fault for getting a degree in Archaeology, Photography, Fine Arts, or some other low demand, low pay field instead of something like Accounting, Finance, Nursing, etc. It's their parent's fault and the government's fault for encouraging them to get an education. No acceptance of personal responsibility whatsoever.

> Okay? I never said anything about who you should support.

Until they eat at an unlicensed taco truck and get food poisoning or have to get their teeth pulled after visiting a quack doctor. Trust me, people (millenials included) understand the importance of some degree of regulation.

Even as a Rand Paul fan I don't understand what your complaint is. You picked a few examples where states are trying to regulate things like food safety and health care provider qualifications.
   
Isn't Rand Paul a big ""leave it to the states"" guy? Would he even take a stance on these state regulations?
  
Why do you think Millenials want unregulated food truck owners and   disparity in hygienist qualifications? 

Hygienists make about $36 an hour in NJ. Multiply by 35 hours a week and you've got 5k gross a month. The license requirement is $120 every two years. Even if a class and hours of self-study are required that might add a few hundred dollars. That's maybe .2% of the person's salary if the upkeep course is around $200.
  
In exchange, the average person doesn't have to ask for the credential paperwork on all the hygienists in a prospective dentist office, and we don't have to wait for inevitable google reviews when some unlicensed hygienist making 10 bucks an hour working for some quack knocks your teeth out to know we should avoid that office. The licensure checks to make sure every hygienist completed the national certifying exam, has no past indiscretions or ethical breaches related to the profession, and also get education on things like liability insurance. Those are things that I think most people would universally agree are important for hygienists.
