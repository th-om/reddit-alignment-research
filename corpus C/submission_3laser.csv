3laser,"ELI5 Is there a political reason why no politician ever replies to the line ""At least George W Bush kept us safe"" with the obvious ""Except for the largest US terrorist attack of all time 9/11"".",97,fcjnews,"When Jeb said that line (or anytime it's been brought up in any debate the last decade) is there some political reason why opponents never pounce on the obvious fact that this is only true if you don't count the largest domestic terrorist attack in US history that happened under his term? Why on earth does it seem like everyone in America feels that ""doesn't count"" when talking about W Bush and cannot be mentioned whenever this line is used? Is it some sort of political etiquette to not count a president's first catastrophic attack against them in America? I'm sure I'm missing something but it seems like such a straightforward retort that would have blown Jeb's statement out of the water. What would the backlash against this retort be if a candidate came back against Jeb's like with something like ""except for 9/11""? I just can't fathom why no politician, even Democrats, ever point this out in a public venue. Would it be the same if 9/11 happened at the same amount of time into Clinton's term or any other president? If 9/11 happened at the same time in Obama's term I'm pretty sure everyone would use this line to crucify him but it seems taboo to use when talking about Bush.
