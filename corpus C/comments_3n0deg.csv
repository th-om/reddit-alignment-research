cvjpwo5,1,t3_3n0deg,awa64,"> 1. Planned Parenthood is a charity: People donate money to PP (Planned Parenthood) because they support the work PP does. PP in exchange gives away free services funded by the donations.

Planned Parenthood is a not-for-profit health clinic. Some people donate money to PP because they support the work PP does, much the way people donate to children's hospitals or a hospital associated with their favorite church. Patients seeking care at a PP clinic pay based on a sliding scale based on the patient's income and insurance status, with those at the bottom end of the income scale (or who feel unsafe using insurance coverage provided by their parents or significant other for confidentiality reasons) often being accommodated with no-cost care. Programs such as [Title X Family Planning Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_X) and similar state-level programs help clinics such as Planned Parenthood to pay for these patients who can't pay for themselves.

> 3\. Governments use tax money to support PP: If governments major form of income is taxes, then it stands to reason that the vast majority of funding given to PP by the government is tax revenue.

The government isn't funding Planned Parenthood. The government is reimbursing health clinics that offer certain health care services to individuals who can't otherwise afford them, because we agree that people having access to those services even if they can't afford them is a long-term net positive to society.

So long as Planned Parenthood is an accredited health care provider that provides services the Government effectively offers a bounty for, the government isn't *choosing* to fund them any more than they *choose* to fund hospitals receiving Medicaid patients.

> 6\. PP supports abortion: while it is true that abortion is only one of many things PP does, it is a pretty well established fact that PP supports abortion.

Under the Hyde Amendment to Title X, passed at the same time Title X originally was, Planned Parenthood is expressly prohibited from using any government funding to pay for abortion services.

> conclusion. By using tax money to fund planned parenthood the US government is forcing people, who do not necessarily agree with abortion, to donate to a charity that goes against their person beliefs.

Conclusion: Planned Parenthood is a health care provider, and the US government, by law, hires health care providers to provide certain health care services to certain individuals with no out-of-pocket cost to those individuals.

To defund Planned Parenthood without stopping paying for those health care services altogether would be a Bill of Attainder, explicitly declared illegal by Article I Section IX of the US Constitution.",16,0,1443645246,1444721297

3. I'll have to look into that. 

6.I didn't say that they use tax money to preform abortions. But their tax money is being used to support institutions that support abortions. A pregnant woman going to planned parenthood is far more likely to be recommend an abortion than a woman going to Low Malinda (a Cristian Hospital that also gives free medical treatment to those that need it).

To a Conservative they would much rather have their tax dollars go to to Low Malinda than Planned Parenthood. And they cannot make that choice because the government is making it for them.

The point isn't semantic, it's level-of-interaction. The only reason the government cares about Planned Parenthood being a for-profit or not-for-profit institution is taxes. The reason the government *gives money* to Planned Parenthood is that it's a health care provider.

> A pregnant woman going to planned parenthood is far more likely to be recommend an abortion than a woman going to Low Malinda (a Cristian Hospital that also gives free medical treatment to those that need it).

Loma Linda University Medical Center is one teaching hospital in San Bernadino County, CA. Planned Parenthood has 820 clinics throughout the United States, and many of those clinics are the only provider of reproductive health services to low-income families in that county.

> To a Conservative they would much rather have their tax dollars go to to Low Malinda than Planned Parenthood. And they cannot make that choice because the government is making it for them.

The government isn't making that choice for them. Patients are. Do you want the government more involved in declaring which doctors patients are and aren't allowed to see? And do you think it's worth preventing low-income families from seeing a doctor at all to stop them from seeing one you personally dislike?",5,0,1443646704,1444721301
