Well, to start, this is a faulty premise. Nationally, both of these men are polling under 30%.

>I mean, when it comes right down to it, I am simply not comfortable knowing people like Kim Davis, Ann Coulter, Pat Robertson and many others vote in the same elections I do for representation in government.

Then leave. Part of being in a democratic system is having people that disagree with you.

If we went through with your crazy plan, how would it work?

Let's look at the [2012 electoral map by county.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/2012_Presidential_Election_by_County.svg/2000px-2012_Presidential_Election_by_County.svg.png) Liberal-land is going to consist of a lot of isolated geographical swatches, with no connection between them. Between those swatches? Why, [current-America's food supply](http://blogs.usda.gov/2013/03/07/usda-releases-new-maps-identifying-major-crop-producing-areas-in-the-united-states-and-abroad/). Other than the land alongside the Mississippi, Conservative-land would control pretty much every major crop-producing area.

Do you like electricity and cars? The coal and oil producing areas all look mostly red to me.

And what about all those poor bastards that live in the wrong-colored county? Are we gonna make them move, or just rip away their representation?

And what are we going to do in 15-20 years, when we reach equal levels of tension between the Blue Dogs and the Progressives, or the Tea Party and establishment GOP? Will we split those countries down, making even more small countries? I mean, there will always be some level of philosophical and political conflict. If we all agreed on everything, life would be pretty boring.",14,0,1442647609,1444726844

For now they are. I firmly believe their support will outgrow the other candidates'. They have a very real appeal to their respective bases.

>Then leave. Part of being in a democratic system is having people that disagree with you. 

The people I mentioned above and I more than ""disagree"". I think they are fundamentally wrong to believe in a god, for example, and to let their beliefs guide them in the polls to curb what I see as the civil rights of others. That is something I don't believe can ever be fixed.  

Everything you said following has little to do with the overall idea. I'm speaking from a purely political opinion standpoint, not a practical one; I don't actually *think* a split of the country will ever happen.",-8,0,1442648394,1444726844

If I've said it once, I've said it a hundred times: polls don't mean anything this early on. It's a name-recognition contest.

>The people I mentioned above and I more than ""disagree"". I think they are fundamentally wrong to believe in a god, for example, and to let their beliefs guide them in the polls to curb what I see as the civil rights of others. 

That's disagreement exactly, nothing more. Using extreme rhetoric doesn't make your disagreement so fundamental that these parties are forever irreconcilable in the same government. It just means you personally are very angry about it. And the vast majority of Americans believe in God, so you're in the minority there even within your group.",7,0,1442669571,1444726848

I mean, that's just your run of the mill diverse, democratic state. You're going to have a little bit of crazy no matter where you are. Most Democat and Republican voters are good people, for the most part, and most politicians want the same thing - strong economy, safety at home and abroad.
