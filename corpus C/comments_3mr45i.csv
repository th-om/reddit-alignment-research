[But in his 2011 budget request issued on Monday, Mr Obama said the project was too costly, ""behind schedule, and lacking in innovation"". US space agency Nasa has already spent $9bn (Â£5.6bn) on the programme.(Feb 1, 2010)](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8489097.stm)

$150 billion spread out over 10 years is $15 billion a year and our budgets will be around the $2.1-$2.5 trillion ranges, every year, over that time period (2010-2020).

Do you consider $15 billion a year too much?

cvhfc4k,0,t1_cvhdwb9,neveroddoreven,">Do you consider $15 billion a year too much?

Not him, but I consider that too much. NASA's budget for the past few years has been roughly $16 to $18 billion which isn't going to change any time soon so you've got limited funds. By taking up $15 billion of that you're talking about wiping out pretty much everything else NASA does: the earth science, the planetary science, the aeronautics research, ect... Which I'm personally not a fan of doing.

Obama and most establishment politicians are pragmatic first and foremost so they work with what they have. Would it be awesome if NASA's budget was doubled or tripled so we could afford a massive rocket like the Ares V, a flagship cryobot mission to Europa, or a giant circular space station that could generate artificial gravity? Of course! But Obama can't make congress give NASA a 200% increase in funding because well... science is cool! Obama had to work with the resources at hand and he decided that Constellation wasn't financially feasible. I agree with that. Do I think SLS is the best path forward? Maybe not, but at least it's realistic.

Not to mention Constellation's godawful Ares I. The idea of putting humans atop a solid rocket booster that can't be shut down once it's started just seems like an accident waiting to happen.",3,0,1443479845,1444722609

You haven't read much history of NASA then.  The other way to look at this (that you didn't mention) is that a lot of NASA's projects go over budget (e.g. Hubble).  They're doing what has never been done before.  They're pioneers.  Because of this, budgets often go over.

So Constellation was another NASA project that would have went over budget.  Either that or its deadline (2020) would have been pushed back (more likely). 

I saw nothing wrong with keeping the program alive by spending $1.8 billion a year on it.  Maybe it would have taken until 2030 to get humans to a near-Earth asteroid- that would have been fine with me.  President Obama flat-out cancelled the program, however.

Sure, there was a recession in 2010, but the President was pumping money into all kinds of programs to stimulate the economy (e.g. tens of billions per year for clean energy).

cvhkwpa,1,t3_3mr45i,HealthcareEconomist3,"Yes. While every geek (including myself) has a permboner for spaceflight we don't currently approach it in the right way.

* Human spaceflight is generally a vast chasm of waste, it doesn't allow for additional innovation (beyond allowing for more human spaceflight) then we could achieve through autonomous or ground controlled missions and the enormous additional expense of human rated systems massively reduces our science spend elsewhere. NASA spend approximately half their budget on current human spaceflight (not counting new programs and research programs to support future human spaceflight), imagine how much more science output we would have if that funding was directed elsewhere.
* NASA is a monstrously inefficient. There are no incentives to even project costs correctly (the incentives are to significantly under-project in order to secure additional appropriations later) and we would get far more accomplished if either the entirely of NASA's funding was redirected to NSF or just all their applied sciences funding was. I would certainly support human spaceflight being funded if it competed equitably with other science funding and was based on incremental proving rather then just throwing tens of billions of dollars at an idea until something either happens or a program is canceled.
* Science spending that is not based on the fixed budget proposal/grant model is simply to susceptible to political manipulation precisely as we can see with  Constellation.
