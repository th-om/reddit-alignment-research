3mjns9,Would our politicians having mandatory week-long experiences of poverty be beneficial to the political system?,26,No_Fence,"There's a common sentiment within poor communities that the rich, and particularly politicians, don't understand what it's like to be poor. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/3mgdzk/poor_people_dont_lack_self_control_poverty_forces/) has some interesting insight, and comments like this one are prominent:

Many politicians have lived privileged lives, devoid of the turmoil and grief poverty causes. If not their whole lives, then at least they're comfortable now -- [more than half of congress are millionaires](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/01/millionaires-club-for-first-time-most-lawmakers-are-worth-1-million-plus/). 

One could argue that this disconnect implies an inability to craft useful policy to keep poverty in check, or even that it leaves many unable to empathize with those stuck in an endless cycle of poverty. [This is a common sentiment in media.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/why-it-matters-that-politicians-have-no-experience-of-poverty/371857/) So, with that in mind, should we require our lawmakers to occasionally live the lives of those they govern? The idea being that they would have to live for a week on the budget of a family in poverty, in a low-income area, without any of their normal resources. Essentially mimicking the life of the poor for one week a year.

If such an experience was implemented for all our lawmakers, would it benefit America, or would the time commitment and organizational difficulty lead to a net loss?
