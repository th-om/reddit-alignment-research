George Bush asked him to present a case for the war to the UN because Powell was viewed as a moderate in an administration full of neocons, and could give the argument more credibility. In retrospect, it seems like Powell regrets how hard he sold out to the neocons, probably even more so now that he sees Iraq 12 years later. ",14,0,1441557304,1444732156

cuskdhr,1,t3_3jv50o,kingvitaman,"""I wish I had not been involved in it,"" says Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, a longtime Powell adviser who served as his chief of staff from 2002 through 2005. ""I look back on it, and I still say it was the lowest point in my life.""

""(Powell) came through the door ... and he had in his hands a sheaf of papers, and he said, 'This is what I've got to present at the United Nations according to the White House, and you need to look at it,'"" Wilkerson says in the program. ""It was anything but an intelligence document. It was, as some people characterized it later, sort of a Chinese menu from which you could pick and choose.""

I think it's safe to say that peddling the Bush admin's lies lead to the downfall of someone who literally could've been the next president of the US. If you read into other cabinet members from the Bush admin it becomes clear that the intelligence was fixed to go into Iraq, and everyone knew they were just looking for a way to go to war. The fact that it was sold as something which would protect Americans is about as cynical as it gets. There was no intelligence ""failure"", and Powell knew it. ",17,0,1441556848,1444732160

cutadyu,0,t1_cusvbe9,Aumah,"From what I remember Powell was one of the most reluctant top administration officials, finally getting behind the invasion either after being convinced by the intelligence (e.g., Tenet's ""slam dunk"" comment) or after it became clear it was happening and he felt duty-bound to support his CIC and the troops by recruiting international partners.

Partly owing to that I've never blamed Powell much. He was a good, old-fashioned, sober-minded conservative surrounded by neo-con ideologues. Ever see those staged experiments where they put one person in a classroom filled with actors who all give the wrong answer to every question being asked? At first the non-actor will defy the group and answer correctly, but soon enough he loses confidence and changes his answer to match the group. That was Powell. He went to Tenet himself and grilled him. Unfortunately Tenet was a small man - a vain sycophant too proud and desperate to please to admit the intel was shit.",4,0,1441614453,1444732164
