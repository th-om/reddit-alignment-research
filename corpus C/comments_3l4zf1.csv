* Racial Justice  
* healthcare  
* environment  
* trade policy (where most democrats bucked Obama).

cv3llvx,1,t3_3l4zf1,TheChange1,"Because she is a moderate with a fuckton of political capital.  The community college plan hasnt really been pushed by Obama at all, just the initial media blitz that came with the rollout.  Honestly, the plan is pretty sound; students have to work at least 10 hours a week in order to receive the benefit.  Because of the work requirement, the issue is framed in a way where Republicans would be hard pressed to say it is an entitlement program without sounding ridiculous and partisan.  

Honestly, Clinton's policies are to the left of center--not the far left.  That is the difference between the two, and trying to say that Clinton will have as hard of a time as Sanders is just plain wrong.  

Hell, did you forget the giant propaganda against Obama calling him a ""socialist""? Sanders is literally a socialist, and no the electorate wont give a shit about the difference between a ""social democrat"" and a ""Democratic Socialist"" (I hardly do).  ",1,0,1442419360,1444727993
cv43hnu,0,t1_cv3llvx,zusamenentegen,"The Republicans should also be hard pressed to say ""Planned Parenthood is in the business of killing babies"" but they manage to do it anyway. As Hillary said herself, they are like terrorists in a sense. 

Would Clinton have an easier time than Sanders? Yes. Would she have an easy time? Hell no. 

And again, supposedly Sander's stances are largely backed by the party. 

* Expanding social security: Hillary backs it too according to her website. 
* Expanding medicare: Something Hillary supports, and there is supposedly a desire for single payer or at least a public option from the party. 
* Investing in infrastructure: Something Hillary and the party supports. 
* Wall Street reform: Something the party supposedly supports, and currently has bipartisan efforts. 
* Party largely opposes KXL and supports combating climate change (Both Hillary and then senator Obama backed the Boxer/Sanders carbon reduction plan). 
* Campaign finance reform. 

Among others. The only position he has that don't seem to have significant support from the party are paid vacation days or breaking up the big banks. 

So I still don't see an answer for how secretary Clinton gets her agenda passed in a gridlocked and polarized congress. Because despite tremendous political capital as a former first lady who knew her way around the ropes, she never managed to pass a major bill in congress. ",1,0,1442446224,1444727993
cv43z04,0,t1_cv43hnu,TheChange1,"Are his stances backed by the party? Yes. Are his specific policies to see the stance happen? Probably not. A 25 cent tax, for example, on every 100 dollars traded on the stock market is not supported by the party. Hell, there were Democrats that opposed Obama's public option, so no Democrats wouldn't blindly follow what President Sanders says. 

Yes, sanders is pulling Hillary to the left, but Clinton will get things done. ",1,0,1442447071,1444727993
cv44h9f,0,t1_cv43z04,zusamenentegen,"I didn't say they would blindly follow him. Obviously Obama has been bucked by the party on more than one occasion. 

How will Clinton get things done? Fuck, congress might not even pass the Zadroga reauthorization, which is possibly the least bipartisan thing of all time. 

Because like Sanders's policies, all of hers cost money. How will she find a bipartisan way to expand social security? How will she find bipartisanship to rebuild our infrastructure? How will she find a bipartisan way to provide universal pre-k and childcare? 

I don't see how she can get things done without MASSIVE compromise on the very issues she says she champions. ",1,0,1442447970,1444727993
