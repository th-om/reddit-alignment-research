cuvavd5,1,t3_3jxn3t,HeloRising,"It probably wouldn't favor Sanders.

Not because Sanders is an idiot or Trump is a political genius but more because Trump is just that much of a jerk. He's the kind of guy who is never wrong when you have a discussion with them. When you've got them dead to rights he just makes a crack and changes the subject. Never admits fault, never gives ground, and never acquiesces to the most mundane of points.

Trump is your angry, neo-conservative uncle at Thanksgiving who wants to ""discuss"" with everyone but never agrees with anything.

A debate would show Trump as a dick but that's been his go-to image from the start so it won't really hurt him. He's already beloved by his fanclub for ""telling it how it is,"" being a jerk to Sanders won't change their minds and it won't be out of character for him.

Sanders could try to throw down and come at him aggressive but Trump would just sidestep and make Sanders waste his breath. Sanders would look like a chump for getting bounced around by Trump's aggression, not hitting back at Trump, or by trying to play ""factual Gandhi"" while Trump pummels him with memorable one-liners and snide comments.

If Sanders is smart, he'll ignore Trump. The best thing for Sanders to do is to pretend Trump doesn't matter because, frankly, he doesn't. Sanders only has to wait until Trump's star burns out around December-January, he has nothing to gain from engaging Trump and much to lose.",3,0,1441774945,1444731998

cutojza,1,t3_3jxn3t,ridersderohan,"Trump would make a lot of inflammatory statements on policy and personal attacks against Sanders. Sanders would try to calmly redirect to policy or responding to Trump's accusations, and in the process get shut out.

Trump fans will say that Sanders had nothing to say and that Trump exposed him for being a liberal scum who wants to destroy America. 

Sanders fans will say that he was respectful and calm in the face of blubbering rhetoric and baseless personal attacks and that Trump has nothing to add to the conversation.

Both sides will continue to struggle to see how the other side can think they won. ",2,0,1441652062,1444731998
