If you're addicted to heroin you are involved with people who are dealing with criminal markets and thus more likely to be involved in them.  Legalize that black market, suddenly the crimes surrounding it fade away.

cv7kb4c,1,t3_3llav4,steelerfaninperu,"Ignoring the ""cure"" part of it because I think that gives the discussion a very clinical, medical feel to it when that is not the answer.

Rehabilitation requires that a person be reconditioned. You have someone who, in most cases, grew up around crime. Now you put them around criminals. When crime is normal, it becomes less of an ethical question.

IMO the secret to fixing that is to get the same criminals in a completely different environment. They need to connect with actual human beings. I honestly believe that working with children would be a fantastic way to go about it. Have the convicted felon ref a basketball game at the Y, or work a bake sale for a school. With a cop present of course.

cv78ifa,0,t1_cv76ir1,Cassus_Caritas,"Prevention is difficult to implement in larger countries with a non-homogenous population. 

Whenever people talk about our faulty prison system they immediately point to European countries as examples. But it's not that easy just to adopt their strategies. 

I'm just playing devil's advocate, I don't know where I stand on the issue myself. However, there are valid counter-points. 

A. All the things you listed ARE expensive. While you addressed this yourself, it's important to mention it again.


B. De-criminalizing drugs is a touchy topic. People are already paranoid and aggressive towards big-pharma, what happens when big-pharma starts releasing ""house-hold"" heroine and other addictive narcotics? Tobacco companies have caused huge damage with relatively weak tobacco, imagine what they will do with narcotics and hallucinogenics. Important caveat that marijuana is an exception and is almost another topic all-together. 


C. Is school not affordable childcare? Furthermore, we have seen how government-run projects have failed immensely; how can we trust the same system with child-care? 

How responsible should the state be for other people's children and in running their lives? Is this not a scary precedent? 


D. Higher education for all. How? First, it's expensive. Secondly, it's even more expensive because new schools will have to be developed since current universities could probably not handle the load. 

Lastly, there is a deep economic concern with ""higher education for all."" If everyone has a college degree, what makes people different? The whole point to going to college is so you learn a skill and stick out. If everyone has similar degrees, then we flood the system. We already have a glut of college graduates looking for work, what happens when we increase this pool and decrease the status of a college education? Then there becomes a push into STEM, however a push into STEM comes with lower wages and other drawbacks, which are particularly concerning for an educational field that has concerns with low pay and benefits. 

I make these comments to point out that this issue is NOT easy, it is complex. 


E. The U.S is not a homogenous population, and it is very large. Some European countries can afford all sorts of interesting treatments and other things, but they are different! They have a different type of culture and population. 

For example: Japan has an extremely low crime rate. Their culture frowns upon it heavily, and their population is so homogenous that it is quite rare in comparison. In countries with greater populations and different cultures and ethnicities and groups you get far greater variability, and thus, ""across-the-board"" systems and solutions are less effective.

Well, all of the studies show that early childhood is the most important time of one's life to set a good direction toward a productive life. If kids spend the first 7 years not reading books and learning how to think, they'll have a relatively difficult time in school after that. Poor performance in school can lead to a higher inclination toward crime. Do you think the smart kids or the dumb kids in your highschool are more likely to end up in a life of crime? (Excepting Wall-Street crimes, of course)

Higher education creates opportunity for a productive career doing something positive, where no access except for the privileged creates community divisiveness and higher inclination toward crime by the have-nots.

I don't really think it is so much a matter of 'smart vs. dumb' because I have seem both succeed and fail under different circumstances.  A factor much more indicative of whether a child will have problems/commit crimes is whether he is raised in a stable family.  Statistically, kids from divorced parents are more likely to commit crimes than kids from married parents.  

>Higher education creates opportunity for a productive career doing something positive, where no access except for the privileged creates community divisiveness and higher inclination toward crime by the have-nots.

Not necessarily.  It all depends what you major in.  The student loan crisis is a problem because a lot of meaningless degrees are being given out.  Also, the idea that poor people can't go to college is insane.  Loans abound, for better or worse.  Couple that with an ounce of ability and it's really just not an issue.

Furthermore... There are whole groups of criminals that *do not particularly have anything wrong with them.* 

Take, for instance, the drunk driver who kills someone. The moment after he has done this he will perhaps even already have such a strong conviction and a horrification at what happened that he'll never drink and drive again. Perhaps others will feel jus as strongly but, one night, get drunk and get back into a car. 

Take the man who accidentally kills another man in a fist fight. It is not as if people who engage in a fist fight (especially young people) are inherently wicked or evil; it is just something that sometimes happens among people. What is there to be cured in him? And how can we judge that?

The best we can really do is try to rehabilitate drug addicts. Many other criminals are fair enough in thei rmotives to begin with -- shooting someone down who shot one of your friends, participating in gang life to make thousands of dollars in a manner of weeks, etc. might be morally wrong, but I am not even sure we can locate something about these people that has to be 'rehabilitated.'
