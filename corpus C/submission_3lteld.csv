3lteld,"The way primary elections work, can't the GOP simply ""block"" Trump's nomination even if he leads in public opinion polls?",33,Pastreu,"I am not from the United States, so I looked up how the primary elections work (for example in [this video](https://youtu.be/_95I_1rZiIs)). Now to me it seems like the public vote might not really be the decicive factor in who is elected a party's candidate - actually it almost feels like ""appointed"" would be a better word than ""elected"".
Now there is a lot of buzz surreounding Donald Trump, and at the time I am writing this, he is still ahead quite a bit in the polls. However I wonder how realistic his actual chances of becoming the GOP's presidential nominee really are. From my (european) perspective it looks like, while he may be a crowd favourite, he has burned a lot of bridges within the party establishment, criticism seems to come from pretty much every corner of the party. And with the establishment seemingly having such a big influence in the primary election/appointment, is there any real chance that Trump will not simple be ""blocked""?
Or am I not getting how the elections work after all? I'm confused either the primary elections work the way described in the video and Trump shouldn't be a big problem for the party because they can easily block him - or the election work differently and Trump actually has a realistic chance and the public opinion polls actually do matter so some extend...
Someone more familiar with that weird system please enlighten me.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lteld/the_way_primary_elections_work_cant_the_gop/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442850044,1444726057
