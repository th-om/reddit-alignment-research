It says 55% would consider Trump and 53% would consider Bush. 35% said they would never consider Trump, and 36% said they'd never consider Bush.

You're talking about a difference of 1% in a poll where the margin of error for the Republican subsample is +/- 5.3 percentage points and asking whether Jeb Bush can still be considered competitive. Really?",5,0,1442180983,1444729332

That's...precisely what it does (refute that it connotes a meaningful difference). Given the margins, you cannot say with confidence that there is a meaningful difference. You can make the point that their ""would/would not support"" numbers are similar, but that's about it. ",7,0,1442184554,1444729336

That's not the point of median income, nor is it the point of the number given in a poll.  The point is to give you a meaningful benchmark from which to ascertain relative standing.  Median income and polls do that well enough.",-4,0,1442202351,1444729336

Trump and Bush obviously have different numbers, but since those two numbers are within the margin of error of one another, the result isn't statistically significant. Generally, in order for a poll to say with confidence that X will be the outcome, the number will need to be twice the margin of error.

You can use the poll and say pretty confidently that roughly the same number of people dislike Trump and Bush (benchmark). You cannot say with confidence that more people dislike Bush than Trump (difference), because the difference is within the margin of error.",1,0,1442203415,1444729336

Margin of error matters.  If the median income is $5 +/- $2 then the value lies between $3-$7 with a very high probability.

So when you quote these very tight polls that have a margin of error larger than the difference that means the poll isn't saying what you think it's saying. ",3,0,1442219381,1444729336

Of course it matters.  So does the stated number.  Does the stated number give you a rock-solid result?  Of course not, that's not how statistics work in any field.  However, it does give you a number, and that number conveys meaning.

If the elections occurred today, and if the elections were determined by favorability ratings, then by going off this stated number, you get an idea who has a higher probability of winning or losing.  It's all probabilistic, even outside the margin of error.",-1,0,1442231547,1444729336
