3k6avz,"If this whole Kim Davis affair doesn't terrify you, it should, and for reasons that have nothing to do with gay people getting married in Kentucky.",229,Trotskyist,"Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last couple of weeks, you’re probably at least somewhat familiar with the ordeal surrounding Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis’ refusal to comply with a court order to issue marriage certificates to gay and lesbian couples, and her subsequent arrest for doing so. Currently, all but two Republican candidates (Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie) have come out in support of Ms. Davis’ actions. Essentially, they are arguing to the public that the decisions of the judicial system are not absolute, and are not something that Government officials necessarily need to be comply with. Despite the media’s narrative of an open debate on the legality of the judge’s actions, in truth no such debate exists. The law is clear on the issue. Kim Davis disobeyed a direct order by a federal judge, who was enforcing a ruling made by the Supreme Court. She refused to comply, and was thus arrested on the grounds of contempt of court. Fundamentally this is no different than if you or I were to disobey an order to pay a traffic fine— If you disobey a judicial directive you will be arrested.

Many even go so far as to argue that the actions of the Supreme Court were unconstitutional in and of themselves. This argument is absurd. The Supreme Court are themselves the final arbiters of constitutionality. Any ruling they make is, by definition, constitutional. There always have, and always will be disagreements on interpretation of the constitution. However, a legal system must be black and white. Fortunately, the founding fathers foresaw this and created a body that would be the final say on such issues— the Supreme Court. It is in the very nature of the Supreme Court that it’s decisions cannot be wrong, as they are the ones who decide what is right (legally, of course). If this seems like an astonishing amount of power, it’s because it is. This is why it’s not entrusted to one person, but instead the collective judgment of nine justices, each of whom must be OKed by both the executive and legislative branches. Supporters of Ms. Davis argue that she did not break any law, or that she was only following Kentucky law, etc. Again, this is just simply untrue. She broke the “supreme law of the land,” the US Constitution, as determined by the Supreme Court who by definition cannot be legally wrong. Period. End of story. There is no room for debate here.

Yet, here were are today, where every major GOP candidate has come out in defense of Ms. Davis' actions. In less than two years there's a good chance that one of these men will be living in the White House. Consider for a moment the implications of a sitting President holding the position that each of these candidates do. It would be fully within their power to deploy the National Guard to prevent the judge’s order from being carried out, subverting the entire judicial branch of government, and undermining the very constitution that they [at that point] will have sworn to uphold. This is the sort of action that causes constitutional crises and governments to fail. Our democracy only persists because we make it so. If we choose to stop ‘playing by the rules’, which is to say following the constitution, it will fail, as countless governments have before it. There is nothing fundamentally different about the United States that makes it immune to these dangers. If you still support Ms. Davis’ actions I implore you to reconsider. We are nothing without the absolute rule of law, and without it the United States as we know it today very well could soon be a thing of the past.
