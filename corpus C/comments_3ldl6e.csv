The other difference is that Booker is much less ideological than Sanders, and in that respect he isn't as ""progressive"". At the same time, he is much more likely to advanced beyond the Senate.

My opinion about Hillary Clinton's character is that she's a lifelong opportunist who will take whatever position she thinks will get her elected.

I don't get that sense from Cory Booker. Booker seems to genuinely care about the issues he's faced as a politician, and it's lead him to openly come out on some issues (on gun control and drug decriminalization) that aren't popular, even in his own party.
