cv4s1a1,0,t1_cv4c5ox,Monkeyavelli,They can *because* it's a circus.  They want a big fight because it brings ratings.  That's why they focus so much on Trump.,2,0,1442504771,1444727718

cv4cpzg,0,t1_cv4bv5j,Not_Without_My_Balls,"When the intro came on I felt like I was watching Monday night nitro, and the way the moderators spent the first 10 minutes of the debate trying to instigate some kind of trump confrontation circus was disgusting. They also got pushed around by pretty much every candidate, especially Fiorina. Reagan and Obama definetly got the most time in this debate though. ",10,0,1442462828,1444727718

cv59cyr,0,t1_cv4qzc4,cougar618,"Wow, you're right. But are they doing it like how I described it? or is it just a pleb tier debate and one star studded one?

What I suggested was rank the canidates popularity:

1) trump

2) Carson

3) Bush

4)next nerd

5) etc.

Then have the evens debate one day: so carson, walker, cruz, whoever on one day. and then the odds on the next day; so trump, bush, and whoever else is in the clown circus. As it is, it's people you don't care about going at it when practically no viewership, b/c people are at work, etc. and then the main event, where the biggest most popular dominate the talk time, and the rest fight for crumbs.

cv4vlgm,1,t3_3l9cek,CrapNeck5000,It seemed clear to me that CNN was content to let any candidate jump in at almost any time on any topic they wanted. Plenty of people chimed in on questions that weren't asked of them and in instances where their names weren't brought up.,1,0,1442510189,1444727721
