3ma8e6,What is the conservative explanation for why healthcare in the US is so expensive?,47,Gintoh,"There has been a lot of articles about conservative **alternatives** to healthcare. These have good ideas, for instance portable Health Savings Accounts so that your health insurance isn't tied to your job. But that doesn't address *why* healthcare is expensive.

The two most common explenations I see are

-Because of over litigation

-Because insurance companies can't sell across state lines.

However these tow arguments don't seem to be enough. First of all there are many studies showing the effect of tort reform on healthcare prices would be relatively minor http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2014/10/15/study-dont-expect-big-health-care-savings-from-medical-malpractice-reform/

Second, you can sell health insurance across state lines, it's just that the plan being sold has to meet all the requirements that the state has put in place.

Then there's the argument that our 3rd party payer system (meaning we get healthcare through insurance) incentivizes us to over consume because people are shielded from the cost of healthcare. Over consumption means higher demand, which raises prices. The problem with this is that according to a study talked about here, unnecessary services only account for 8% (210 billion dollars) of our healthcare spending. I don't see how reforms addressing this issue would bring down prices much.

All the conservative healthcare proposals seem to beat around the bush by not saying *why* the plan would lower healthcare prices.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3ma8e6/what_is_the_conservative_explanation_for_why/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443148256,1444724303
