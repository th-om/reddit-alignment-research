cuur7su,0,t1_cuu493m,revanyo,True and for the most part young Democrats take pride in that for some weird reason. They see themselves as the pendulum in major elections but they dont know the damage they do by bot voting in midterms,1,0,1441741018,1444731752
cuu3y9m,1,t3_3k1mta,JayConz,"The Washington Post blog The Fix has gone into detail on this.  

You're right: the wipeouts of 2010 and 2014 totally screwed the Democratic Party for the long-term.  I'll try to find it tomorrow, but there's a chart (horrifying for Dems, laugh inducing for GOPers) that shows the extent of the wipeout in purely state legislatures.  It's startling.

Clinton masks the Dem problem; if she was to have to leave the race or didn't exist, the GOP would be the overwhelming favorite for 2016.  ",6,0,1441685159,1444731752

cuuotui,0,t1_cuudfgs,DarthGinger,"Looking at that chart, it just seems to me that the political pendulum swung back the other direction. The Democrats' current situation in the state legislatures is the same as the Republicans' situation in the 80s and early 90s. Even as recently as 2008, Republicans were facing similar situations.

The political pendulum will swing back. It always does. ",1,0,1441737467,1444731752
cuuoy3t,0,t1_cuuotui,JayConz,"Oh, definitely.  The Democrats won't retain their current electoral college edge either (I expect that the midwest will slowly turn more GOP, over time).  But for the next few cycles at least, the Dems are in trouble (the senate in 2018 is a good example; unless a GOP president has REALLY messed up, it's not going to be pretty for the Dems).",1,0,1441737642,1444731752
cuu4qj6,1,t3_3k1mta,balorina,"The DNC has problems making issues relevant.  They try with odd things the ""War on Women"" and ""Take away your social security"" but it just kind of falls on it's face and doesn't really inspire anyone to actually get off their asses and vote.

The RNC is far, far better at rallying it's base with buzzwords and single-issues.  They've made cultures out of these things that the DNC can only dream of.  The Kim Davis thing seems petty to the left but you know who's going to vote?  The people supporting her because it has been framed as a big gov't vs religious freedom.  The people criticizing her will stay home.

Give credit where credit is due, Bernie is taking a page from the Republican playbook and using Wall St as much as they used 9/11.  I don't know if it's enough to excite the DNC base more than Trump is exciting their base for them.",4,0,1441686952,1444731752

It isn't Democratic presidential candidates out mouthing off about how she's being persecuted or whatever.  It isn't the Democratic Party who has been stumping about unlawful USSC decisions since Obergefell.  Hell, Nate Silver and company had an article a while ago demonstrating that one's views on gay marriage are the most likely determinant of which party one is going to align oneself with.  It isn't left-wing media [attempting to compare her to Rosa Parks](https://www.conservativereview.com/Commentary/2015/09/Kim-Davis-as-the-Modern-Day-Rosa-Parks).

cuuhcp0,1,t3_3k1mta,sillyhatday,"Back in the 1990s the Republicans started taking local politics very seriously, down to county commissions. The result was that they got wins and created a bench of next generation national political candidates. They also got control of tons of state houses, which means control over creating congressional districts. Of course the built them favorably for their party, getting more Republicans elected. Democrats cry foul now, and I get it; it feels slimy. But that's how the game works and they played it brilliantly.

That said, I don't think the bench for national Democrats is that bad. If HRC tanked tomorrow there would be a serious Elizabeth Warren draft and she might take it. She'd be a fantastic candidate. There is also Corey Booker, Deval Patrick, and the Castros(meh).",0,0,1441725813,1444731752
cuuroyn,0,t1_cuuhcp0,revanyo,"Not to mention the Democrats gerrymander their states also.(Chicago/Los Angeles) 

Personally I think the Castro's are just  novelty figures, and have little chance of moving up on the ladder. Partly due to Texas being a deep red state and partly to them not having the experience. They are sort of like Macro Rubio who is meh imo but with less of a compelling back story or experience. Rubio was Speaker of the Florida House. Julian Castro was a city councilman. 

I think the DNC likes them and is aiding them in getting experience. Seriously, was Julian the most qualified to lead the HUD.",1,0,1441741746,1444731752
