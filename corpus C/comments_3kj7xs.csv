Reagan used the phrase ""There you go again"" during his debates with Jimmy Carter to great effect.  Pinning the phrase ""You avoided the question again"" on Trump could cement in the voters' minds that he really does *not* know what he's talking about.  ",12,0,1441987816,1444730122

Who's doing better? The entire global economy is still digging out from '07. Donald seems to think that economics is a zero-sum game. China and Mexico getting richer isn't them 'winning' and us 'losing'. China and Mexico catching up to where we used to be is a pre-requisite for us moving even further.


Donald is a real-estate developer. His industry is the second or third oldest in history. He knows nothing about technology, has no clue how economies of the future might work, he thinks turning back the clock on the last 30 years of economic advancement is a good idea, and thinks the key to a prosperous future is steel-mills and assembly-lines. Owning a few billion dollars worth of tacky buildings gives one no insights into economics, it just proves that you're a good salesman. Which he is.",7,0,1441978930,1444730122

Sorry for the sarcasm, but I disagree with your statement. Trump is a billionaire, saying he knows nothing about an economy is silly, especially when the other candidates have less credentials than he does. 

Trump's biggest concern at the moment is controlling his temper/voice (Bleeding from wherever), foreign politics (build wall!), and social policies (the Republican Achilles' heel). ",3,0,1441988734,1444730122

People like Trump thrive on attention. Any attention. Even negative attention. They just want *someone* to be looking at/listening to them and if they have to act out to get that then ok. Thus far his acting out has played well with people (though I contend it's going to get old after a while).

To handle Trump you ignore him. People ask you about him, tell them you're only entertaining serious candidates. If he insults you publically, ignore it. If you're asked about it, you didn't notice he'd said anything.
