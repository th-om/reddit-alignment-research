3m2qpm,Why aren't we seeing the rise of a moderate candidate?,254,Dr_Schaden_Freude,"Why aren't we seeing the rise of a moderate candidate, Republican or Democrat, given the polarity of the front runners?  I understand Hillary is too corrupt establishment and Trump too Jersey Shore and Sanders too far to the left for a lot of the population.  Is it just because controversy sells in the media?  Are certain 'non negotiable' policies too entrenched in both parties? Seems like the first person to come into the race with a strong, coherent, policy that focused on the 'middle ground' would sweep a huge portion of the vote.  You can have your guns but shouldn't be able to buy military grade out of the trunk of a car, or government funding for the first couple years of college but not writing a blank check for people to live on.  Just seems odd that so many people and organizations put so much funding and support behind candidates who obviously and willfully alienate most everyone else that doesn't share their narrow view of the world.  Or are we just at the beginning 'build your core base' stage and as the election draws closer we will see a 'Great Taming' of all the rhetoric to appeal to larger crowds?",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3m2qpm/why_arent_we_seeing_the_rise_of_a_moderate/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443021839,1444725024
