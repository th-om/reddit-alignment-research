That's completely false. 100% false. So false it's completely wrong. My mind is covered in false.

cuui3k9,0,t1_cuuhv63,CompactedConscience,"I got about halfway through typing a response, realized I am probably wrong, and gave up. For the sake of argument:

The linked source above looks like it supports my point with its numbers. The payouts are less than what it claims is total withholding tax collected.

 Furthermore, the point would be to reduce the overall tax burden of people with children or that meet eitc criteria without giving them a refund. Even in the increasingly likely event that I am wrong about the main point, the argument that such a partial refund would be pointless is a bad one. ",1,0,1441727057,1444731764
cuuig9z,0,t1_cuui3k9,sporksable,"You're misreading the numbers here. The child tax credit is, again, a refundable credit. That means you get any excess back in the form of a direct payment. Only some tax credits share the same refundableness (refundability?). When the article says that the treasury paid 4.2 billion in child tax credit, it means they literally paid people 4.2 billion bucks. Not just reduced their tax burdens, the treasury gave them money. That's how the child tax credit was designed, and that's how it functions here.

cuujxv5,0,t1_cuuig9z,CompactedConscience,"Yeah, it is pretty clear you are right on that front if you read the article and do more than just skim for numbers. 

I would fall back on a few arguments. First, second order effects. If we believe, [like the overwhelming majority of economist](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_5vuNnqkBeAMAfHv), that the type of immigrants who might immigrate illegally are a net benefit to the economy, then that extra growth will also increase tax revenue. Second, as /u/Cutlasss pointed out elsewhere in this thread, there are also sales and property and other taxes that are collected. Finally, it is my opinion that even if illegal immigration did costs us the amount of money mentioned in the study that it would still be worth it to make immigration easier. This is for a few reasons. People who illegally immigrate are often the least well off and a benefit to them is therefore more valuable than a benefit to the average tax payer. Also, the cost of enforcement is very high and might outweigh any savings to the tax payer. ",2,0,1441730000,1444731764

Entirely not true. I went to two naturalization ceremonies in the last few months for friends that immigrated legally. Both were absolutely PACKED and standing room only. All those people immigrated legally from countries all over the world. I've personally known at least ten people who immigrated here from Europe and S America that did so legally. Of course there were challenges, but it was far from ""almost impossible"".",1,0,1441712449,1444731764
cuuf82q,0,t1_cuubm6r,CompactedConscience,"Anecdotes aside, the evidence shows that it is actually very difficult. There are unreasonably small caps on the number of people that can immigrate in a given year, and this was not always true in US history.And it is virtually impossible for people with low ties to the US and zero skills. That is a category that most of these people fall under. 

Look at the wait times in the cart on [this page](http://nbclatino.com/2013/04/11/the-immigration-line-whos-on-it-and-for-how-long/). For some countries where people are most desperate to enter the US, wait times are well over 10 years. That is absurd for people trying to escape extreme poverty, political violence, or general instability. The most favorable wait time is about 3 years, which is still an agonizingly long period. 

Nothing in my comment was meant to imply that nobody legally immigrates, but the demand for legal immigration far outstrips the supply. And the process is almost draconian. ",1,0,1441721931,1444731764
