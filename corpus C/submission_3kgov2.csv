3kgov2,Eli5 - how is raising the minimum wage going to effect the economy in the long run and why is raising minimum wage better than lowering minimum wage?,56,jacksrdtt,"From where I sit, increasing minimum wage only puts off the issues we have today. The value of the dollor will only go down as a result. This is because the quality of goods the dollor will aquire will be lower than what it is now (labor). Not to mention the Capitol a business has is now worth less since they will need more of it to achieve the same final product. 

 I am like seriously confused. I also think that raising the minimum wage would also take money from the upper bracket and distribute it to the lower bracket. This is what the economy needs. At the same time, what happens to the middle class? It's a lose lose for them. Me being in the middle class I expect my pay to stay the same while my cost of living goes up. In which case I am fucked. 

I've been thing about lowering the minimum wage. That would make the market more free and flexible. Less incentive for big business to move to China which means more jobs here in the US. This also means poor people will become even more poor. Wouldn't the cost of living also go down though?? What if we did this and simultaneously raised taxes on big business that operate outside of the country. Evening the playing field. While simultaneously cutting the amount the government spends on welfare/foodstamps/unemployment/etc. 

Mainly I think cutting the minimum wage would only work if the people I the United States straightened up.  I believe the people who live in poverty would be more inclined to have their kids go to school and become educated if they faced harder living conditions and less support. I mean, realistically speaking, as a society we want the best and brightest out of out people. That's what makes a nation great and we cannot have that by enabling the people to stay where there at.
