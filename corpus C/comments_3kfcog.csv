cuwy2o6,1,t3_3kfcog,ClockOfTheLongNow,"During the State of the Union in particular, there's always one cabinet member that doesn't attend in the event of just this sort of situation.

Beyond that, though, in the unlikely event that everyone in the current line of succession were to disappear, we would likely see a rush of state legislatures appointing/electing a House of Representatives which would then elect a Speaker who would then become president by virtue of the line holding.

This is all theoretical, and there may be some legal historian with more insight on this, but this would ultimately become a significant but minor legal crisis that would be overshadowed by the larger situation of an entire government being taken out, and the elections as scheduled during whatever year they were coming up would sort everything out for good afterwards.",16,0,1441906039,1444730438

cuwybsn,1,t3_3kfcog,FlareCorran,"AFAIK, that's not covered in Presidential succession. What you're describing is basically a complete decapitation of the government, with the only remaining members being the Supreme Court (and I doubt there would be a serious lobby to give Roberts total control.) So we're venturing into hypothesis, really.

By the way, during the State of the Union address, some of the higher ranking cabinet members are put into seclusion, to avoid exactly this problem. But for argument's sake, they were compromised too.

There are two possibilities:

The first is that we go under martial law. The highest ranking member of the armed forces assumes power. Ideally, this will just be until an election can be thrown together. Likely, we would have an emergency electoral college, with the state legislatures choosing who to send, then the new President would basically be the acting dictator, running everything through executive orders, until Congressional elections could be organized. We would certainly be at war with someone at this point, whoever we could prove had ties to the terrorists.

The second possibilities is that the federal government temporarily dissolves, with all of its power going back to the states (who granted it in the first place.) Governors would have a significant amount of power and the military would likely break apart to join the various national guards. This is roughly what happens in the TV Series *Jericho* (great show.) Various compacts would pop up until something pretending to be an Article V convention can be put together and form a new federal government. Odds are, it would be much looser than the first, with everyone afraid that the same thing might happen again.",6,0,1441906439,1444730438

cuwy3ir,1,t3_3kfcog,houinator,"There isn't a legal answer as far as I know, but given that the military would be doing a lot of things in the immediate aftermath of such an attack, I suspect we would be under martial law for at least until things stabilized long enough to have another round of elections.  Assuming the Joint Chiefs all died in the attack, I suspect control would default to USNORTHCOM, specially the Air Forces Northern National Security Emergency Preparedness Directorate, which has responsibility for supporting a civil governments during a major national manmade or natural disastor.",3,0,1441906077,1444730438
cuwygh1,1,t3_3kfcog,prizepig,"There's no official succession order after that point. 

Practically speaking, not all cabinet members attend the state of the union address, nor do all congresspeople.   That's probably intentional.   

But, if they all died somehow, we would be looking at a martial law situation.   The military would probably assume authority while the country reorganized a civilian government. ",3,0,1441906638,1444730438
cux35yi,1,t3_3kfcog,JustinATaylor,"We have plans for this exact scenario should it ever occur. 

First off, atleast 1 member of the Cabinet does not attend the State of the Union. This way incase the building is bombed and the Pres,V-Pres, Speaker and others in the line of succession are killed we have atleast 1 person still legally allowed to succeed to the Presidency. 

Secondly, some members of Congress are moved to undisclosed locations this way their will still be a somewhat fuctioning Congress to keep the nation going, called a ""Rump Congress"".

In the event of such a disaster, lets say everyone died and the cabinet member left out lives. That person will be sworn in as the President of the United States. States that lost members of Congress will either hold special elections, or have their Governors appoint the new members until an election can be held. ",1,0,1441913838,1444730438
