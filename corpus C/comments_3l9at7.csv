He was the President and he allowed the attack even though there was intelligence that could have led to preventing it.

If people were saying ""he kept us safe after 9/11"", that would be different, but this line ""he kept us safe"" is just a lie and an attempt to avoid blame for the worst terrorist attack in US history. It happened under a Republican President with a Republican Congress with a Republican majority on the Supreme Court. That is the facts.

Zarqawi actually fled into Iraq from Afghanistan to avoid direct confrontation with US troops and to begin launching terrorist attacks against Shias in Iraq.

The problem is he really didn't. Al-Qaeda is still a presence regardless of what you hear in the news. Their popularity has waned in the Middle East but they're part of a coalition of other radical groups that are still quite robust. Additionally, causing Al-Qaeda to shed members isn't a victory unless they go back home. What they've largely done is join other groups in the region. 

He didn't destroy Al-Qaeda or neuter it, he just distributed the membership a bit.

On top of all that, it's arguable that the instability and animosity towards the US in the Middle East got a huge boost from the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan (which Bush spurred) and created a more fertile ground for terrorism than had previously existed. So he actually made us *less* safe that we might have otherwise been.

>Also, can you please name how many terrorist attacks there were on US soil after Bush intervened in Al Qaeda?

This is a terrible appeal to make because it's impossible to verify. 

I stopped eating dairy in 2001 and we haven't been attacked by Al-Qaeda since. So then I can claim my eating dairy protects us because how many attacks on the US has Al-Qaeda carried out since I stopped eating dairy? None!

How many foreign terrorist attacks occured on US soil before 9/11? One? 

But Bush didn't set out to simply get rid of al-Qaeda, he set out to fight a war on terrorism that has been an abject failure.

Basically, your entire understanding of politics is based on talking points, nothing else, because if that wasn't the case you'd have been railing on this sub for months about Hillary's ignoring intelligence prior to the Benghazi attack, Obama's foreign policy failures in multiple countries, and the constant forward movement of Iran's nuclear potential.  But, as I sit here looking through about six weeks of your post history, that's not what I see at all.  I see you avoiding discussion about these issues with Obama and Clinton almost entirely.

Thats like blaming Roosevelt for Pearl Harbor. Yes, the intelligence was there but that is only after the fact. You cannot blame the President or the military for allowing it to happen. People wanted it to happen and we just could not stop it. He did not ""ignore it."" He was not a great President, but you cannot credit him to 9/11 happening.



The two wars that happened after was a shit show. A lot of people wanted it. If he did not go to war, his successors would have told the public he was weak and a incapable of defending America. Him going to war, made us susceptible to attack. It is way too complicated to just say cut and dry Obama did not keep us safe.




Lastly, Jeb Bush is saying that because he is trying to safe face. Americans have a bad taste in their mouth from Bush. They hate the name. They hate the idea of another Bush in the white house. The one thing George W. Bush handled well was 9/11 and the events that proceeded it. Jeb has done everything in his power to steer his name clear of his brother, even marketing his name as just ""Jeb!""
