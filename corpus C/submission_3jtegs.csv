3jtegs,The Astonishing Weakness of Hillary Clinton's Campaign,59,CQME,"Let me lead by saying that I prefer Hillary Clinton to become POTUS in 2016.  I was rather disappointed that she didn't win the nomination in 2008, although luckily enough Obama has IMHO proven to be a good president.

However, if she wants a shot at 2016, ***she needs to start campaigning.***  She's given only 3 interviews total since she announced nearly 5 months ago, and one was broadcasted in Spanish with Univision.  The only reporting that dominates the news about Clinton is the steady drip-drip torture of her email server problems, all the while any discussion about her positions gets the shaft.  There has been little to no excitement at all coming out of her campaign, no rallying calls, no pictures of crowds, just dead silence and media avoidance.

This has got to be the worst campaign strategy one can envision, because candidates, like celebrities, thrive off media attention, even if it's negative.  She's endured countless attacks by both the GOP and the media, and it's arguable that these attacks, and her responses to them, are one big reason why she's considered to be a strong candidate, because she's still ticking and still fighting.  Yet, for some inexplicable reason, she's pretty much stopped responding and has lost her voice in the press.

Add to this that the DNC is doing its absolute best to silence any debate amongst its candidates, and you get the distinct impression that the Democrats think that the GOP will implode due to an avalanche of bad press.  Instead, it's actually grown more robust, with [Trump now leading ***all Democrats*** in recent polls.](http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=d950cadf-05ce-4148-a125-35c0cdab26c6)

Do you agree with this analysis?  Why or why not?  Do you think it's far too early to be sweating anything?  Or do you think the polls are fair indicators of what candidates need to do to get ahead later in the game?",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3jtegs/the_astonishing_weakness_of_hillary_clintons/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441507311,1444732242
