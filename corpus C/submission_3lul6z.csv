3lul6z,Scott Walker dropping out of race. Who is my next choice?,114,pjabrony,"Scott Walker was the horse I was backing in the race, but now he's out, according to the New York Times (http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/09/21/scott-walker-said-to-be-quitting-presidential-race/?_r=0).

I liked him because he had stood up to the unions in Wisconsin. I had liked Chris Christie before that because he stood up to the teacher's union in New Jersey, but then he took on a host of left-wing positions that soured me.

I suppose right now I would throw my support to Ben Carson, but I would prefer an experienced official who had achieved some sort of government cut.
