cv8naqz,1,t3_3lr469,Cookie-Damage,"Sigh... I guess I have to nip this in the bud now before people start downvoting this thread like crazy and accusing me of asking you all to do my homework.

This isn't homework, friends. I literally wrote this all on the spot because I'm interested in politics and I wanted you guys to predict a fictional election.

This is all original and not copied from any book, packet, print-out, or email. It came from my head. This is r/politicaldiscussion so I thought it'd be interesting to propose a fictional scenario and see how you guys respond.

Edit: I was inspired to propose a fictional scenario [just like this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3hrcrb/armchair_nation_building_korean_unification/)

Edit 2: [This topic about Korea poses some questions that could be easily taken from a textbook](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3hy7dm/the_korean_peninsula_whats_going_to_happen/), but it doesn't seem like people were accusing the author of trying to get them to do their homework.",9,0,1442804450,1444726212
cv8njcq,1,t3_3lr469,CompactedConscience,"This is a fun idea for a thread. 

This is a clear Green party victory. First, there are substantial environmental interest in the state. The major city is hilly with many scenic vistas. Ecoturism is essential to the rural economy. Salt will run up the score in Alexandria and manage a decent showing in the heartland. The suburbs don't seem to have any strong partisan loyalties that would disadvantage Salt, so she will take advantage of the historic nature of the election to snag an upset win. 

The divisive and contentious issues you have established will also lead to a lot of brutal mudslinging both in the Democratic an Republican primary and between the nominees of those parties in the general. The two losers of the democratic primary both endorse Salt because of this turmoil. Salt is more moderate than a typical Green party nominee, which makes these endorsements more natural. Furthermore, Duncan takes advantage of the political climate to snag his parties nomination, but is not that popular with the general electorate. By the time the general election rolls around, heads will have cooled. 

Edit: I definitely believe you that this isn't a homework assignment, but just in case it is: my answer is not very realistic and probably wouldn't get you a very good grade. I was just having fun with it. A few people in this thread sure are cynical.

cv8nm3z,0,t1_cv8njcq,Cookie-Damage,"Hmm... I like this outcome. While it's not totally unprecedented for independents to win statewide offices (Jesse Ventura, MN)(Bernie Sanders, VT) it's still difficult to win if you're not a D or R. However, I think you justified Salt's victory well.",1,0,1442805011,1444726216
cv8qx3m,1,t3_3lr469,Thissite1s,"I think it comes down to Mcclain v. Juravesse. I think Mcclain wins slightly by winning over the moderates. The liberals in Alexandria are mostly dissatisfied with the entire race.

cv8y9oa,1,t3_3lr469,CarolinaPunk,">He has a similar position on the LGBT community, stating he does not believe they are true Americans, and thus they are not covered by the Constitution.

Maybe this sentence is why no one wants to participate. Like Seriously, why don't you go outside and and realize what republicans actually think. ",4,0,1442840589,1444726216
cv96ox2,0,t1_cv8y9oa,Cookie-Damage,"Well, A.) People are participating, and B.) I presented a Republican (Juravesse) who certainly does not think things like that, and I also presented a right-leaning libertarian (Dehuys) who also does not think that harshly of LGBT. I presented one far-right candidate who says loony things because there are in our world candidates who actually say screwed up stuff like *LGBT aren't covered by the constitution*.

When did I ever imply that I think republicans actually think like that??? I stated in this post that Richard Duncan is low in support except for a few far-right areas. Maybe if you had read what I wrote more clearly, you'd understand that this guy is an unelectable candidate who certainly does not represent the 2002 GOP in any form, but you still accuse me of somehow implying that all republicans think like Duncan...

cv8wth0,1,t3_3lr469,MrIvysaur,"I think we could use some more information.  Analysts base their predictions off data; give me some population figures.  How much more/less populous is Alexandria than the suburbs?  What is the total population of the state, and what is the democrat/republican/independent breakdown?

What was the reputation of the senator leaving office?  Does the state have a history of bipartisan senators?

What is the religious breakdown by numbers?

I'd say, based on what I know, that McClaine beats Juravesse in the general election by a fairly slim margin.",1,0,1442836410,1444726216
