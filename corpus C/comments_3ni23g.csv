Rich people are paying 40% to 45% in total tax liability in this country. That isn't liberty, that's absurd. 

The last recorded Federal effective rate for the 1% was 29% in 2010 when marginal rates were 35% Since then we've gone to 39% with no added deductions, so we can assume the federal tax liability falls between 31% and 33%. This includes capital gains taxes in the average.

Now add in payroll taxes, state taxes, local taxes, and city taxes in some places.

cvojoqp,1,t3_3ni23g,RECIPR0C1TY,"So I am an idiot when it comes to one of the most complicated budgets in the history of mankind. The solution seems simple to me and I would love for someone smarter than I am to point out why it isn't as simple as I think it is.

Why do we have to take from Peter's pet program to pay Paul's pet program, or why do we have to tax both Peter and Paul to pay for both pet programs? Why can't we just keep the most recent budget but subtract the percentage of deficit across the board?

In other words, if we are X% over on the budget we just cut X% from every program. I realize this gets complicated with obsolete programs and new programs, but if you allow each department to divvy up their funding themselves it makes sense. The department of education gets last years funding minus X%. Can't do everything you want to do? Tough luck, figure it out.

I am sure the whole idea would be more complicated than I have presented it, but couldn't the theory hold true?",-1,0,1444014592,1444718814

cvow9p0,0,t1_cvovvxl,RECIPR0C1TY,"Because a tax increase just keeps funding our addiction to implement programs that we can't afford. Who actually believes that we will stop spending more than we make once we get a greater income? We keep spending money as a government that we don't have, and a tax increase will not change that.

However, if we can't we actually eliminate our debt until we eliminate our spending problem. So solve the short term problem first. Once congress has proven to me that they can actually manage one of the largest budgets in history, I will entertain the idea that they can handle more of my money.",0,0,1444053508,1444718814

Are you forgetting about what Greece is going through as a result of massive amounts of debt to GDP?

You are minimizing a problem that has only gotten bigger and bigger as a result of people like you that keep minimizing it. There is a finite amount of debt that the country can accept. We can handle way more than Greece can handle, but there is a limit. Denying that is denying basic common sense.",1,0,1444054265,1444718814
