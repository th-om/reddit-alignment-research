3k9f3z,Is the gamer generation poised to be the new greatest generation?,64,poliforecast,"In an era that is seeing the rise of vindictive protectiveness (macroaggressions, trigger warnings, the banning of words and discussion of ideas that might cause distress, sexual paranoia, social justice smear campaigns, etc.), the need for a dynamic, proactive and engaged generation of young men has never been so great.  It’s fortuitous that gamers are coming of age, replacing past generations who were raised to be passive consumers of television and books, and thus ill-equipped to confront the attempted hostile takeover of our culture by those who would seek to disadvantage or silence people and ideas they deemed patriarchal and/or privileged.

Imagine if vindictive protectiveness had risen on college campuses a few decades ago.  It would have gone unchallenged and unquestioned as the next step in social progress.  And where would we be today.  Living in a world where no one speaks freely for fear they will suffer retribution, and as a result bad ideas and false prosecutions are free to run amok.  Fortunately that’s not the case.  Fortunately gamers are coming of age just in time to put a check on check your privilege.
