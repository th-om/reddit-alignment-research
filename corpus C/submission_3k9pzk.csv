3k9pzk,What would happen if employers were required to pay for the cost of their employee's government assistance?,67,fyobpdncsafmtbu,I've been reading a few of the discussions about minimum wage.  The same discussion about it has been going on for ages and nothing about these discussions seem new.  If we assume that employers should be paying their employees livable wages then perhaps the best way to force that equilibrium would be simply to bill each employer for their employees welfare costs.   I don't know much about economics or politics so what would be the consequences of such a law?,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3k9pzk/what_would_happen_if_employers_were_required_to/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441819942,1444731174
