3jsowy,"Been dreaming up a new political system, any thoughts?",13,CaptainCoul,"I don't have much experience with politics but have been constructing this idea of a new system based on what seems most natural to me. People dislike the notion that a few hundred have the power to control millions. There isn't much of a way around this, but it should be possible to create a political system and government that better represents the populous, and more precisely to represent our best selves. My version of this “proportional representation” is as follows:

Everyone comes together to form groups of between one and three hundred people. These groups are geographically based and so every four years one must attend a local hall with your ""roughly"" 150 neighbours and vote on two representatives, largest proportion of votes wins. Understandably, fewer groups would be 'based' in rural Scotland than groups based in cities, per square mile.

The second step is how the political system is thus built upon this foundation. Assuming an average size of 150 people per group, in the UK there would be 400,000 groups, and these would be gathered into clumps of 10, each clump representing 10 neighbouring groups, and so about 1500 people. The two elected representatives of each group would come together and the twenty of them would represent the 2000 part time. This is the first rung/tier of the political system and the twenty of them would act as a sort of neighbourhood leader. Every four years they would vote for two of them to move to the next rung.

This second tier would form after 10 neighbouring pairs of ""first tier representatives"" came together and the twenty representatives would represent their collective 15,000. This second tier, would be paid a decent salary, would fulfil a role similar to an mp or district/county council, and serve a 4 year spell. The twenty men/women in the second tier would also vote for two of them to go on to represent in the third tier.

The third tier: This would constitute the two representatives of ten second tier groups coming together and representing their collective 150,000 people. Finally, the twenty in the third tier would nominate 1 person to enter a final tier of around 400 people. These 400 people would hold a position that could be comparable to the present-day government. The 400 would be composed of two groups of 200, in the UK there would be a northern group and a southern group. This is where the normal citizens can vote again. 5 representatives from each group of 200 will campaign much like the present day system and two of them will be voted through to fulfil the figurehead/leader role.

(Oh and the thing about pairs acting as representatives of the populous was partly inspired by the Roman democracy before the Emperors became a thing. They always had two heads of states, which yes seems ridiculous at first glance but apparently led to more balanced and wiser decision making. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_consul)

So everyone will have roots/access to those in power, it would be much more connected. Any thoughts or comments would be very interesting :) In my eyes this is true democracy, and I would love to see the sort of people who would end up making the societal decisions in this system, compared to who we have presently.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3jsowy/been_dreaming_up_a_new_political_system_any/,PoliticalDiscussion,1441493287,1444732296
