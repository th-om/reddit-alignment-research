cvoq2mq,1,t3_3njjgc,notbusy,"> Why should we care about paying it off at all?

Right now about 7% of our taxes go towards interest on the national debt. Interest rates are at historic lows right now. When they go back up, that 7% is going to go up as well. How much can we afford? Can we afford to burn 10% of all our tax revenue? 20%? Sure, we can raise taxes, but that just burns the wealth and savings of our citizens.

Also, perpetual inflation becomes attractive to government which continues to burn even more wealth and savings of our citizens. With all this diminishing wealth, investment decreases, at least domestically. More and more gains from growth shift to foreign investors while domestically we pay higher taxes, more interest on debt, and more to inflation.

A little debt is manageable, but there will come a point where it chokes off the potential wealth of future generations if we're not careful. That's why we should care about keeping it in check. In my opinion, at least.",3,0,1444031727,1444718566
cvowl7x,0,t1_cvoq2mq,usethaforce,"Very true, basic economics teaches that EFP or expansionary fiscal policy always works in the short run, but in the long run it is incredibly unfeasible.  Although interest rates are low, foreign investment is still far ahead of all other countries because we are a safe investment with by far the strongest and safest currency.  When these things begin to change, everything will go to shit.  Balancing the budget should be a major topic in the election.",1,0,1444054149,1444718570
cvoocr7,1,t3_3njjgc,awa64,"In 2010, two Harvard economists published a paper that concluded GDP growth drops off sharply when a country's externally-held debt reaches ~90% of its GDP. This was widely used to justify calls for harsh austerity measures in the US and Europe following the debt incurred trying to mitigate the global financial crisis following the housing collapse.

Unfortunately, they published in a non-peer-reviewed journal, and when a University of Massachusetts-Amherst grad student actually decided to look over their numbers, he found a rather embarrassing error in their Excel spreadsheets, plus some rather gratuitous cherrypicking and glaring omissions used to help the data better support their desired results. Essentially, their paper was total garbage, and done right, showed basically no correlation, or perhaps even reversed cause-and-effect.

This hasn't done anything to slow the calls for austerity, though. Which brings us back to the usual cycle of budget scolding as a way of demanding cuts to entitlement programs, followed by calls for tax cuts once the budget is even remotely back in line.

Runaway deficits could ultimately lead to issues with inflation and slowed economic growth, so as the economy improves we probably ought to try to shrink the deficit down to zero... but there's really no reason to freak out over the existence of a deficit in the first place, because it's an effective tool for dealing with economic crashes, not an indication of imminent ruination.",3,0,1444025255,1444718570

cvonzmm,1,t3_3njjgc,mario_sunny,"At some point the interest on the debt will exceed tax revenue and all the institutions we know will collapse shortly afterward, and tens of millions of tax consumers will be suddenly without a large portion of their income.

Yes, even governments have to pay interest. Else no one would give them a loan in the first place. So it's not like they are completely divorced from economic reality as you seem to be suggesting.

We shouldn't care at all. It's not our debt. Let society collapse. This is preferable to being a debt slave. Maybe for once we can ***not*** found society upon the future labor of the unborn.",1,0,1444024132,1444718574

If the interest rate on government bonds is 1.5%, and the rate of inflation is 2%, the government is effectively not paying interest. And that's been the situation a lot, lately.

""You'll definitely get this money on this date"" is enough, when people are dealing with quantities of money larger than gets insured by the government. Or when they're hedging their bets against other currencies.",4,0,1444025516,1444718578

Know what happens exponentially, with constant inflation? Eventually, you would print more paper money than the mass of the planet.

cvozfyb,0,t1_cvoucp8,Crayz9000,"That's a rather simplistic look at things. A cheeseburger used to cost a nickel back in the 1930s. Today, it might cost $5. But we don't hear people talking about how we have to mint more nickels than the mass of the planet!

My point is that, assuming inflation and consumer purchasing power rise *roughly* at the same rate, nobody really notices. Sure, that dollar doesn't go as far as it used to when you were a kid, but you're making a hell of a lot more than you used to.

The problem today is that wages haven't quite been keeping pace.",3,0,1444059112,1444718578
