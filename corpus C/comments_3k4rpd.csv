Being Secretary of State does not mean that you are automatically aware of what information is classified, and what isn't. Especially when the classification of information is often disputed, arbitrary, and inconsistent.

Unless Clinton received something explicitly marked classified, then it is incredibly difficult to argue that she *knew* the information she received was classified.",3,0,1441745478,1444731470
cuvgk7l,0,t1_cuuu47q,carter1984,"> Unless Clinton received something explicitly marked classified, then it is incredibly difficult to argue that she knew the information she received was classified.

Really? This sounds like some insanely rationalized justification. As Sec of State, there is, WITHOUT A DOUBT, a certain type of information that is known to be classified, whether marked as such or not. I'm sure you could call on past sec of state, or any other high ranking member of the govt that handles classified information, and they will tell you the exact same thing. If you are in that position and are unaware of what information should be marked classified, then you shouldn't be in that position at all.",3,0,1441796477,1444731470
cuvkraz,0,t1_cuvgk7l,DarthGinger,"I've already said that the classification of information is disputed, arbitrary, and inconsistent.

By disputed, I mean that agencies within the federal government often disagree on what is and is not classified. The State Department may think that something is unclassified, while the CIA thinks it's classified.

By arbitrary, I mean that the decision on whether information is classified is largely up to the individual who gathers the information and issues the report. 

Inconsistency is the product of both of the above. The same information may be considered classified by one official and unclassified by another. The perfect example of this is a transcript of a conversation that occurred in 1974 between the Secretary of State and CIA Director. A heavily redacted copy of that conversation was released to the National Security Archive by the State Department, with the State Department claiming that the conversation contained ""classified"" information. The very same transcript was published in full by the State Department 8 years ago, and the unredacted copy is even available on the state.gov website.

When there is that much inconsistency in how the government designates classified information, it is hard to argue that Clinton knew what information was classified and what wasn't if there were no classification markings on the information.

Now, I agree that there is some information that is obviously of a classified nature. Information that the average person would look at and say ""duh, top secret."" For example: military plans for an invasion of Russia. However, no information of that kind has been discovered to my knowledge.

Legally proving that someone knowingly did something is relatively difficult. It requires some kind of proof that shows that they knew (i.e. information specifically marked classified). Otherwise, innocent until proven guilty.",1,0,1441807212,1444731470
cuvs6jr,0,t1_cuvkraz,carter1984,">Otherwise, innocent until proven guilty.

Well, considering at least two emails are known to have been classified as ""top secret"", and more than 150 were simply ""classified"", it's hard to argue that Clinton has no culpability. 

>Legally proving that someone knowingly did something is relatively difficult.

Very true...and why this investigation is ongoing. Whether she is found guilty in a court of law or not should have no bearing on a judgement as to her accountability to the electorate. Remember...OJ was found not guilty too.",1,0,1441818957,1444731470

I'm not arguing that Clinton has absolutely no responsibility. Clinton actually doesn't argue that either. I'm arguing that there is insufficient evidence at this point to prove she did anything criminal, like OP was asserting.

> Whether she is found guilty in a court of law or not should have no bearing on a judgement as to her accountability to the electorate

So what you're asserting here is that the rule of law doesn't actually have any meaning? That even if you can't prove someone did something, it doesn't matter as long as you can get enough people to think they did something?
