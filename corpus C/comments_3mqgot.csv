cvh92fh,1,t3_3mqgot,houinator,"As someone who views a politicians stance on protection of the unborn as fairly important, it makes me pretty skeptical of her.  While a person can of course change their position, politicians who were pro-choice until just before they decided they wanted to run for office as a Republican make me exceedingly wary.  Adding to that wariness is the fact that as recently as 2013, a charity she runs donated substantial amounts of money to Planned Parenthood.

> If this is true, how do you think it would affect her candidacy if it receives significant media coverage?

It might hurt her in the primary, though her strong condemnations of the nation's largest abortion provider gives her a lot of protection on that flank (and Trump who is in the same boat is near the top of the polls), so i'm leaning towards it ultimately not costing her too much in the primary.  I don't think it will really matter in the general election, Romney had a similar issue, but it didn't really factor into why he lost the election.",12,0,1443470238,1444722715

I believe that many of these GOP candidates just pander to the social issues because those attract votes, and I can understand that as any sane person would do the same.

I don't agree with her current stance, but Fiorina seemed 100% earnest at the debate when she gave that impassioned talk about what she imagined was probably in the planned parenthood videos. If it becomes common knowledge that those sentiments were newly adopted in honor of a national campaign, it makes her seem focus-grouped and fake, which is the opposite of authenticity.",1,0,1443483053,1444722719
