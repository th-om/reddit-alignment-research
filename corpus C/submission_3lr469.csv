3lr469,Predict This Fictional Senate Election,17,Cookie-Damage,"Hi guys,
So I want to try something different on this subreddit. Most of what we see on here is discussion on current politics. **However, what I want to do is present you guys with a fictional set of political candidates, in a pseudo-fictional area, and you guys predict the outcome of a possible U.S. Senatorial election.** I was inspired by an old post asking how the two Koreas could be unified.

So without further ado, I'll introduce the setting.

* Setting: The state of Menominee, in the Midwest U.S. The year is 2002. The state is somewhat hilly, with a river winding from south to north, splitting the state between east and west. On the north bank of the river, there is the state capital of Alexandria. Surrounded by Alexandria are several suburbs and exurbs, some stretching to the coast a very, very large lake.

* Alexandria is a very liberal city, and sports a sizable African-American, Muslim, and middle-class population. Banking and finance are important in the city as well. In 1999, *Mary Croy* magazine named the city the 2nd most important financial center in the Midwest, behind Chicago.

* The suburbs outside Alexandria are not liberal, but still lean left to some degree. However, some are very purplish and have voted GOP in the past.

* Travelling down the state you will find mostly rural lands and small towns. Conservatism reigns here, and the heartland of the state remains a Republican stronghold. However, the closer you get to the river, the more moderate the politics becomes. Notable towns such as Vanderburg and Lusitania tilt right, but have a strong Democratic minority. Tourism is big in this areas as well due to scenic beauty and river touring.

Towards the southern reaches of the state is the second largest city, Marquette. While not as liberal as Alexandria, Marquette is a democratic stronghold for Menominee.

**So, there are the main demographics of the state, now I'll get on to a few important notes.** This is 2002, right after 9/11. Patriotism is sky-high in the aforementioned conservative areas, and that translates to a considerable amount of Islamophobia. Alexandria supports a sizable Muslim population, and in statistics released by CNN, 985 violent acts have been perpetrated towards Muslim residents from September 2001 to May 2002. To break that down, that includes 877 verbal assaults and harassment, 69 acts of vandalism, 35 acts of physical violence, and 4 acts of murder. Outside of Islamophobia, public support for the war in Afghanistan is sky high as well, even among Liberals.

So, now onto the candidates for the 2002 Senate Elections, including Dem and GOP primaries. Note: The seat is currently open, as the current Republican senator is retiring and won't run in 2002.

**Democratic Side**

* Nadia Turner - Age: 55 - Nadia Turner is an African-American politician representing the 4th district of Menominee in Congress. The 4th district includes a good chunk of Alexandria and several suburbs. Turner is very famous in her state, being first elected to Congress in 1988. Since then, she has pioneered several successful EITC expansion bills (EITC is a tax break program that analyzes a family's earnings and their number of children in order to determine how much is deducted from the taxes they'd have to pay). Nadia is popular with the African american community, but not so much with the liberal and populist community. She supports the war in Afghanistan and has since remained quiet on Islamophobia. She stood by the Clintons in the 90s, and received flak from GOP pundits after they associated her with Hillary Clinton's failed healthcare initiative in 1993 and 1994. Furthermore, Nadia recently went through a messy divorce which could impact her poll numbers. Nadia is currently enjoying a small, one-digit lead over her primary opponents. Nadia Turner is endorsed by former Governor of Menominee Linda Carran, NY Senator Hillary Clinton, and State Senator Mary-Ann Kerry.

* Blake McClaine - Age: 48. Blake McClaine is the Attorney-General of Menominee, serving since his appointed in 1999. McClaine previously served as U.S. House Representative from 1993 - 1999. He is a self-proclaimed Blue Dog moderate, and supports full military action in Afghanistan. On social issues, he does not support same-sex marriage, but nevertheless supports legislation aimed at curbing anti-gay discrimination. Interestingly enough, he has prosecuted several cases against anti-Muslim crimes, including several hundred following 9/11. He is also a favorite among left-leaning Christians and the religious left. McClaine currently trails close to Nadia Turner, and is a second place, but he could easily become front-runner if he plays his cards right. McClaine is endorsed by the Blue Dog state office, State senator Amanda Lune-Haggerty, and former Menominee Senator Lydia Klein.

* Gerard Hammond - Age: 39 - Gerard Hammond is a young white activist and liberal community organizer. He is vehemently opposed to actions in Afghanistan, and has accused Turner of being apart of the ""neo-conservative Democratic elite"". He finds support mostly in the populist pockets of Alexandria and Marquette. Other notable facts about Hammond is that he claims that Islamophobia is an ""epidemic"" in Alexandria and both Dems and the GOP contribute to it. He is a distant third in polls. Hammond in endorsed by the Progressive Alliance of Menominee, and State assemblyman Patrick McMurdoch.

**Republican Side**

* Phillip Juravesse - Age: 63 - Phillip Juravesse is an Italian-American politician who currently serves as Menominee Lieutenant-General, since 1991. He is an ardent Reagan supporter, claiming him as an idol of his. He supports trickle-down economics, a stronger police force, and a renewal of ""Christian America"". He is popular in rural Menominee, especially in areas around Marquette. Juravesse supports actions in Afghanistan and further actions in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran. He ranks quite high in the polls, but is weakened by the progress of a younger, more conservative opponent, Richard Duncan. Duncan is endorsed by State Energy secretary Maryl Thomson, Former representative Allen Kilmer, Former representative Greg T. Scott, and former Senator from Menominee Casey Alexander.

* Richard Duncan - Age: 43 - Richard Duncan is a white young, energetic politician representing outer Marquette in the State assembly. He is extremely against Islam, and proclaims that Muslims are untrustworthy. He has a similar position on the LGBT community, stating he does not believe they are true Americans, and thus they are not covered by the Constitution. Like Juravesse, Duncan supports an Evangelical agenda, but goes farther, and suggests that Christianity become the official state religion and evolution is banned from schools. Duncan does not have a large base of support, except for the heavily right wing areas outside of Marquette in the south of Menominee.

**Independents**

* Claire Salt - Age: 58 - Claire Salt is a **Green Party** politician who serves as Reginald County executive, which is a very liberal area on the banks of the river, close to Alexandria. She supports a mainstream liberal agenda, including gay marriage, anti-discrimination in the workplace, and anti-islamophobia. She initially was against the war in Aghanistan, but has since publicly changed her opinion, stating that ""...[W]e must root out terror and extremism everywhere in the world, and we must start in Taliban Afghanistan."" She has also reached out to Reginald County Muslims, offering to pay for the renewal of vandalized mosques and to increase prosecution of anti-Muslim criminals. As the only Green Party candidate, she is the crowned frontrunner.

* Talvin Dehuys - Age: 39 - Talvin Dehuys is an artist and writer, living in the town of Newton as a freelance photojournalist. He has officially described himself as a centrist libertarian, supporting a socially progressive government, but one which ""takes its hand out of the cookie jar"" when it comes to the economy. Dehuys supports actions in Afghanistan, and remains quiet on anti-Muslim acts. He polls very low, but has an enthusiastic reception from those looking for an ""anti-politician"".

**So those are all the candidates and the political climate in which they live. You can decide if you want to muse on the primaries, or you just want to jump into the general election.**

All I ask for this topic is that you present what you perceive as the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate, and who will eventually win. Thanks!",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3lr469/predict_this_fictional_senate_election/,PoliticalDiscussion,1442801669,1444726210
