cuz8pb1,1,t3_3kot9f,Unshkblefaith,"Syrian refugees face two major political obstacles to getting into the US.

1. The US is already hostile toward low skilled immigrants and even more so towards low skilled Muslim immigrants.

2. An influx of immigrants from the Middle East represents a major security risk and a screening nightmare. 

These two factors combined make acceptance of new refugees a no go for a Republican congress and administration, and a major political risk for the Democrats as well.",4,0,1442085063,1444729767

Not saying that all of them are muslim extremists, but if you're letting in hundreds of thousands of refugees from that sort of place without some type of screening, you're potentially letting in maybe even thousands of muslim extremists.

Not to mention that most of the ""refugees"" beliefs as part of Islam are completely at odds with European liberalism. ",2,0,1442110262,1444729767
