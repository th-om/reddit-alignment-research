The point is, Iran can do anything they want if they're not going to follow the agreement of not enriching uranium to weapons grade. And at that point, if we discover they are enriching uranium, the deal is done, and we can do whatever we want as well. Demanding access to every place that might be enriching uranium would do nothing to do them from secretly doing it anyway, which is what you're concerned about. 

On top of that, I highly doubt a country as watched and spied on as Iran can enrich uranium without the US intelligence network knowing. Even the Soviet Union had infiltrated our nuclear program in the 40's. Never underestimate the power of the CIA, too. 

The fact is, once we discover Iran is enriching uranium, the deal is done, and it's time to consider war. But first, we'll give them a chance by repealing the sanctions. War is a final option, the cost is too high. No deal would stop them from starting enrichment if that's what they really want.

The international community does in fact get to test the site. What are you talking about.

>If you want to risk your country and the lives of thousands on pure dumb faith, go ahead. 

I think you're the one more likely to be risking lives. Iran understands that the US has a knife to their throat. Iran cannot win any war they start because the US will interfere. No country can beat the US military, we're the worlds sole superpower. ***Everyone*** knows this.

If Iran was as blood thirsty as you claim, they would have gone to war long ago. It doesn't matter if they get a nuclear bomb or not, they would be absolutely destroyed if they did anything the US didn't like. The only reason they have existed for as long as they have is because they haven't done anything stupid to warrant US intervention. There is no proof they have been developing nuclear weapons. There is no proof they have the military strength and projection to threaten us or our allies. 

In the end, there is no difference between an Iran Deal and no Iran deal, except more cooperation and an opening of our economies (something that has always fostered peace in the past). If we find out they are developing nuclear weapons (which is not hard for the intelligence community), we would intervene. But people like you are pushing for war when there is no need right now.

...

>Now, there will be some who will assert that we could have done more – or that if we had just continued to ratchet up the pressure, Iran would have eventually raised a white flag and abandoned its nuclear program altogether. But the fact is the international community tried that approach. That was the policy of the United States and others during the years 2000 and before. And in the meantime, guess what happened? The Iranian program went from 164 centrifuges to thousands. The Iranian program grew despite the fact that the international community said, “No enrichment at all, none.” **The program grew to the point where Iran accumulated enough fissile material for about 12 – 10 to 12 nuclear bombs.**

That’s where we started. **We started with Iran two months away with enough fissile material for 10 bombs. With this agreement, that breakout time goes to a year or more, and that will be the case for at least a decade.**

Let me guess - you also don't know that this deal requires the US to protect Iran from anyone who may try to stop their progression toward a nuclear bomb, and also agrees that they can have the bomb in 10 years... That is the actual sales pitch from Obama:

I keep hearing that, but I'm not sure where it's coming from.  Iran is definitely not allowed to have a bomb ever, the non proliferation agreement isn't being lifted or contradicted.  I think maybe you're referring to the fact that parts of this deal expire in 10 years, at which point it would become easier for them to get a bomb, but presumably when that happens either the threat will have subsided or a new deal will be reached or the sanctions will come back.

Does not support this:

>Iran is past enriching uranium.

From [Iranwatch.org](http://www.iranwatch.org/our-publications/articles-reports/irans-nuclear-timetable):

>By using the approximately 9,000 first generation centrifuges operating at its Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant, Iran could theoretically produce enough weapon-grade uranium to fuel a single nuclear warhead in less than 2 months.  This timetable is longer if Iran operates fewer centrifuges, or feeds the machines with natural uranium rather than low-enriched uranium.

So no, Iran is not past enrichment. 

And here's the key part:

>Without this agreement or the Joint Plan of Action on which it builds, Iran’s breakout time to get enough material – nuclear material for a weapon was already two to three months. That’s where we started. We started with Iran two months away with enough fissile material for 10 bombs. With this agreement, that breakout time goes to a year or more, and that will be the case for at least a decade.

So, no deal means Iran is a few months away from getting a weapon. Even if the deal is as bad as you say -- and you really haven't explained what makes it a bad deal -- nothing has changed; Iran is no closer than they were before negotiations. If they don't cooperate, sanctions snap back into place.

It does sound like the Joint Commission could pretty quickly come to a decision to force Iran to open for inspections.

According to that article, there's a 14 day period for negotiations (after the IAEA starts the clock.) Iran, I'm assuming, could stall that out to be sure it goes the whole length. Then, after the Joint Commission consultations, Iran has three more days to comply. That gets us to 17 days, assuming the Joint Commission acts instantly.

It could, reasonably, take them all seven days. It's almost certainly going to take more than one (and can't reasonably take less than that.) That gets us to a total of 18 days that Iran could stall safely, minimum. It **could** potentially be 24 days, if the Joint Commission takes long enough. Given the makeup of the commission, you effectively need a unanimous vote (since Russian and China can't be counted on to do the right thing and Iran certainly isn't going to vote for sanctions.) 

He should've said it ""can"" take up to that long, but the difference between 18 and 24 days is academic and if one of the actors (France is most likely, imo) doesn't want to make a decision till absolutely necessary, 24 days is certainly possible. If Cruz doesn't trust France, Germany or the European Union to do the right thing, saying that it **will** take 24 days is justifiable.

What's intentionally misleading is acting as though Iran is required to give access immediately, when if they're violating the agreement, the bare minimum 17 days is plenty of time to move anything incriminating.

""If Iran has been conducting nuclear activities somewhere, and we get evidence of that. And then requesting inspection there; and then it is delayed for up to 24 days. Iran can remove equipment, but traces of nuclear material will remain.

It’s impossible to sanitize a nuclear facility that quickly, if it’s – indeed it may be impossible to sanitize it at all. And when inspectors got there after 24 days, it would unquestionably still be evidence it was detectible of nuclear material.""

So at least one former weapons inspector thinks 24 days is enough time. Perhaps the extra seven days would swing the difference, but if they had advance warning that the IAEA had found out or if they were able to pass off the radiation as being from an older program, it's certainly possible.

Either way, Albright's statement is that Iran would be able to prevent the IAEA from being able to prove they were in violation, which is the point.

Again, I'm not a nuclear physicist and don't know how this works. But at least one expert says that it's enough time to cover everything up and if Cruz relied on that expert, you can't justifiably call him a liar for it.",0,0,1442581254,1444727470

It's extremely doubtful that Albright would actually claim otherwise, but even if he did, that doesn't make it any less untrue.

For the record David Albright doesn't even have a PhD. He's frequently quoted and referenced in media because he has a group, ISIS, that puts out information on arms control topics in a way that is amenable to politicians and major media. Often that means phrasing things to sound more frightening than they actually are. Basically he is treated as the ""go to guy"" for statements on nuclear arms control by the media even though there is no particular motivation for that position based on actual merit or accomplishment.

No, my friend. Iraq was a festering shithole way before ISIS came into power. The sectarian division was one step away from civil war. There was killing death squads killing people based on religion. Corruption was rampant and investments made by the U.S. were mostly stolen. The ruling political class of the country pushed the Sunni's out of any real power while constantly having tension with the Kurds in the north. Iran was increasing it's influence in the country. This is the real reason he should have never left. The process and their politics were deeply fucked. We needed to be guiding hand for their democracy. 

Almost everything politically after the war was mismanaged. The entire nation rioted and looted for days before anyone did anything. They told the army to fuck off and barred them from political office (note, a lot of ISIS leadership was former Iraqi military leaders). We didn't ensure that the majority population Shiites wouldn't treat the minority population Sunnis (who were Saddams benefactors) in a vengeful way.

Numerous state investigation have been conducted and none have turned up wrongdoing. Guilty until proven innocent I see is your standard. I, and other like me, do not have such a backward approach to justice.

And let me get this straight, all this time those Planned Parenthood doctors were ignorant that they could criminally profit off tissue donation and didn't criminally profit off tissue donation until these plants from the Center on Medical Research walked in and suggested it? And suddenly they are saying they will commit a crime with a minimum 10 year federal prison sentence for a ridiculously small profit out of the blue? I realize many people think these doctors are ghouls for performing abortions, but that is their own bias, not a reality. They are no more ghoulish than a doctor preparing a heart or blood for storage and transplant. 

Remember, these doctors could work anywhere but choose to work for a non-profit that helps poor men and women receive health care. Do you really think they would go to all the effort to become a doctor, work at a non profit, just so they can become criminals for so little return? Really? I find it hard to believe without real conclusive evidence, none of which has been found yet.

cv54bag,1,t3_3lbb6p,C_L_I_C_K,"If people actually do significant research on Cruz, anyone can clearly see that this guy is a chameleon. Cruz is a wolf in sheep clothing. He will say and do anything for money and votes. Most of his funding comes from a few billionaires. The rest comes from gullible ""conservative"" talk radio zombies who believe every word they are spoonfed about how awesome Cruz is.

Ted Cruz is literally the GOP's version of Obama. Cruz voted for giving Obama fast track to TPP, then voted against it when he found out that his vote won't matter and that TPP was unpopular with his voting base. He wasn't born in the U.S., yet his supporters ignore this when they've criticized Obama for the same thing before he became president. Cruz was also a graduate of Harvard law school, just like Obama. Cruz has had 0 governing experience and worked as a Bush lackey for most of his career before becoming a junior Senator (again, just like Obama). He's a radical ideologue who changes his vote based on where the political winds blow. He's a pompous and egotistical individual who refuses to work with anyone to solve problems... just like Obama. Do some research on Cruz and you'll quickly find out just how evil and two-faced this guy is. He's not a social conservative, nor is he the Christian he tries to portray himself as. 

Also research Cruz's wife. She was a high ranking member of the CFR (Center on Foreign Relations), one of the most evil and powerful globalist groups. She (and Cruz) were responsible for selling out American jobs to Canada and Mexico with NAFTA. It was funny when Ted called the CFR ""a pit of vipers."" Guess he didn't think people would be smart enough to realize his wife was one of those snakes. Heidi Cruz was also a vice president at Goldman Sachs; the worst of the worst international banking cartels that has this world in debt. Cruz supporters are the same people who railed against Michelle Obama, but now totally ignore Cruz's wife when she's 100X more evil and influential than Michelle was to this country.
