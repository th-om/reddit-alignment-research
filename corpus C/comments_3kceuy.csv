“To the extent that we find a statistically significant relationship between trade liberalization and poverty reduction, the evidence points to faster poverty reduction in states and regions experiencing greater increases in exposure to trade.” (Clain and Mitra 2007)

“The principal empirical results that emerge from this exercise indicate that important indicators of economic freedom such as openness to trade ... are robustly associated with poverty reduction.” Quibria et al. 2003

“…less trade restrictions and larger information flows are robustly associated with lower poverty levels. A likely explanation for the importance of trade restrictions is that these matter for import prices.” Bergh 2014

“Our empirical investigation of the impact of economic reforms, mainly trade reforms but also industrial delicensing, shows that there is a fair amount of evidence in support of the poverty reducing effects of these reforms.” Trade Liberalization, Labor-Market Institutions, and Poverty Reduction: Evidence from Indian States (Ural and Mitra 2006)

Review of the evidence: “We briefly review the recent literature on globalization, and present empirical evidence showing that economic globalization has been correlated with higher economic growth and lower poverty rates.” Spier 2010

“This paper discusses the possible causal relationships and empirical associations between globalization and growth, growth and poverty reduction, and, finally, globalization and poverty reduction. We argue that globalization can contribute much to poverty reduction both directly and by accelerating growth.” Wallack 2004

Review of the evidence: 1. Poverty reduction is mainly driven by growth in per capita income. 2. Trade openness is an important determinant of economic growth. 3. The economic growth associated with trade liberalization is as pro-poor as economic growth in general (meaning that it isn’t economic growth which simply benefits a privileged few). Berg and Krueger (2003)

Review of the evidence:“We argue that there is no simple generalizable conclusion about the relationship between trade liberalization and poverty, and the picture is much less negative than is often suggested. In the long run and on average, trade liberalization is likely to be strongly poverty alleviating, and there is no convincing evidence that it will generally increase overall poverty or vulnerability.” (Winters 2004)

Review of the evidence: “Despite the impossibility to rigorously and unambiguously assert that trade openness is conducive to growth and poverty reduction, the preponderance of evidence supports this conclusion. However, the majority of empirical macro studies also show that the impact of trade on growth and poverty is also generally small and that the causes of indigence are to be found elsewhere. But it is in fact extremely arduous to find evidence that supports the notion that trade protection is good for the poor.” (Li 2012)

“The evidence from individual cases and cross-country analysis supports the view that globalization leads to faster growth and poverty reduction in poor countries.” Aart and Kraay 2004

This doesn't make any sense; you would literally need the population to be expanding faster than firms can employ people. Plus, it doesn't [match the picture we see](http://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ourworldindata_world-poverty-since-1820-in-absolute-numbers.png). As horrible as they seem to us, sweatshops are actually [good opportunities](http://nebula.wsimg.com/1832f781f5a58691f607296ca94f22c9?AccessKeyId=B292FE55DF6AE1C4A636&disposition=0&alloworigin=1) for labour in underdeveloped countries. Depending on hours worked, sweatshop wages exceed the national average in eight to ten out of the ten countries studied in that paper--and in half of those countries sweatshop wages are three times higher than the national average. 

Revulsion towards sweatshops--even when considered in the context of an underdeveloped economy--is probably a perceptional bias. We see a lot of nasty things on the news about workers (especially children) being abused or factories collapsing. . . What we don't hear about are the people in subsistence agriculture because they can't get manufacturing work of some kind, and subsistence agriculture is [exceedingly dangerous](http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---safework/documents/publication/wcms_110193.pdf).

Good; outsourcing disrupts but not displaces labour. Jobs are not permanently lost when they are outsourced, labour just shuffles around to a more productive application. Outsourcing is good for the global economy and global living standards, since the overall pie gets bigger when countries specialise in areas where they have a *comparative advantage*.

cuwufq5,1,t3_3kceuy,derrick81787,"Child labor is bad, but I'm not sure a boycott is the way to deal with it. Think about *why* those children are working. The company doesn't own them and isn't forcing them to work. They aren't literally slaves. Although many people call them that, they are using hyperbole. These children are working because they come from poor families, and they need to work in order to have enough money to survive.

So what does a successful boycott achieve? Well, I guess the company capitulates, fires all the children, and hires an adult work force. What does that do for the children and their families? It leaves them without the money they need to survive, which was the reason for them working in the first place, and now they and their families are starving to death. Is that an improvement over surviving by working in poor conditions? Not really. The children and their families chose to send them to work in the first place because working was better than the alternative of not working.

These people need more economic prosperity in order to come out of this cycle. If the parents can provide for their families, then the children won't *need* to work. That is how you deal with it. That's not easy to do though. It's much easier to say *""Child labor is bad!""* and boycott, so that's what people do. However, I would argue that not only does such a boycott not help the children, but it actually hurts them.

It's not an easy problem to solve, but removing these families' ability to choose to send their children to work, without providing some other alternative to support themselves, is not a solution. These people don't *want* to send their children to work in factories, but they need to do so to survive.
