cv9576x,1,t3_3lteld,JohnZoidberg1985,"Public opinion polls are ultimately irrelevant to the process. You win the nomination by receiving the support of a majority of your party's Convention delegates.

Most delegates are tied to a state primary vote. Each state has its own vote, and whoever wins that vote gets that state's delegates. Trump is currently leading the polls for those elections, but they don't actually happen until early next year.

There are also some delegates who are just party officials; they can support whomever they want regardless of what the voters do (they are sometimes referred to as ""superdelegates""). Most, or perhaps all, of these people oppose Trump.

If Trump were to win a majority of the state delegates, the superdelegates might still have enough votes to throw the nomination to someone else. However, the voters would probably not be pleased if party bigwigs conspire to pull the nomination away from the person that they supported.

The reason why opinion polls don't matter is because they're hugely unreliable 6 months before votes actually start taking place. Many people, particularly moderates, are not yet paying any attention to the campaign. When moderates and less other less extreme people pay more attention to the race, more centrist establishment candidates get a huge leg up.

Trump won't lose because of super-delegates. He'll lose because the vast majority of Americans find him profoundly un-electable if not a terrible candidate altogether, something that isn't reflected in polls, today.

In principle, no. There's no way the Republican Party would be able to take a clear primary winner, who have slowly but surely assumed all support within the republican party, to the point where everyone probably has an image of them from a primary making speech, ticker tape falling on their head with the word winner somewhere. Everyone knows who the nominee is, and then the party picks someone different. NEver could happen

A brokered convention where htere's no clear winner? Quite possibly.",2,0,1442879502,1444726067
cvakeio,1,t3_3lteld,reasonably_plausible,"Let's clear up how the nomination process works:

First, every state is allocated a certain number of electors based off of their population and the relative strength of the party in that state. These electors get to meet in a national convention to vote for who gets to be the nominee of the party. Each state gets to determine who they send as their convention delegates, how the delegates are chosen, and can make rules on how said delegates can vote.

Most states have a primary system (which is why we tend to call the process ""the primaries""), this is where people vote for the candidate they want and based off of the relative totals, electors are sent to the national convention. Some states are winner-take-all where the person with a plurality gets allocated all of that state's delegates. Whereas different states will go with a proportional system of allocation.

The other type of process we have are called caucuses. In these states, voters will come together in a local area and will decide whom among them will go to represent their local area in a larger meeting. This larger meeting applies the same process and they decide who to send to represent them in their county. The county meeting sends people to a statewide meeting and the statewide meeting sends people to the national convention.

Among all of these states, there are different restrictions on how the delegates that they send can vote. The vast majority of delegates sent to the national convention are ""pledged"" meaning that they must vote for a certain candidate for, at the bare minimum, the first round of voting (many states have longer periods where the delegate must vote a certain way). All the pledged delegates vote for whom they must vote for, certain states send unpledged delegates who are able to vote for whomever they wish to, and then both parties have certain party leaders as delegates who are similarly unpledged.

For a candidate to be the nominee, they must gain a majority (not just a plurality) of the delegates. So, if Trump has a majority of the delegates at this point in time, he wins and the party can't really do anything about it. However, if he only has a plurality then the process moves onto the next round of voting. As I stated before, each state has different rules on how long a pledged delegate must vote for the candidate that they were sent there to represent. So, as the balloting goes on, more and more pledged delegates would become unpledged and free to vote their conscience.

This is important because each state selects their delegates in different ways. Many will have lists of potential delegates from the campaigns themselves and send those people to the national convention. Because those delegates come from the campaigns, they are unlikely to abandon their candidate upon becoming unpledged (though they may support some sort of dealmaking). Yet, other states will have different processes to send delegates which may mean that a delegate who personally supports a certain candidate is sent as a pledged delegate for another. These delegates, once released, can then switch their sides.

So, let's say that we get to the Republican national convention. No candidate has a majority of support on the first ballot, but Trump has the plurality. The party leaders can specifically choose to push their support behind a single non-Trump candidate, but they only make up 6.8% of the total delegation. Luckily for them, it is unlikely that Trump will understand the intricacies of the nomination process enough to stack the delegate slate of the states that don't pull electors from the campaigns themselves, so as pledged electors become unpledged it is very likely that his support in the balloting will erode, although it could also be that he is able to pull a deal with another candidate in return for their support in order to get the majority.

**Tl;dr: If Trump solidly wins the primaries, the party can't really do anything. If he is a major contender, but not outright leader, the party can act as a thumb on the scales, but the decision really comes down to the set of 2,470 people (168 are said thumb) that are sent to the nominating convention.**",2,0,1442952442,1444726072
