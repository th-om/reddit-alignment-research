3n00p0,Does the new quote from Rep. McCarthy on the Sean Hannity show discredit the House Select Committee on Benghazi?,146,SapCPark,"Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said this on the Sean Hannity show last night:

> What you’re going to see is a conservative speaker, that takes a conservative Congress, that puts a strategy to fight and win. And let me give you one example. Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?

> But we put together a Benghazi special committee. A select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she’s untrustable. But no one would have known that any of that had happened had we not fought to make that happen.

That quote at least at first glance makes the select committee look like a hit job against Clinton.  Did McCarthy let the cat out of the bad, is the quote a whole lot of nothing, or did it just add more evidence that the committee was a sham?",83,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/3n00p0/does_the_new_quote_from_rep_mccarthy_on_the_sean/,PoliticalDiscussion,1443638542,1444721312
