I also think Cruz and Christie and Paul are all too polarizing to win a national election, either based on their personalities or policy, so all that's left is Bush or Rubio.

Besides Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton being a little too polarizing, a Democrat has been president for 8 years and many people erroneously blame Barack Obama for 'enter problem here'.   

Its just so rare for a Democrat to win after an incumbant 2 term president.
