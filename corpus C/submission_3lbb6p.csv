3lbb6p,"Ted Cruz misinformed millions of Americans last night by saying Iran has the ability to push inspections back 24 days after a suspicious nuclear site has been discovered; they do not have this power. What does this say about the former lawyer, who can clearly read and understand legal documents?",236,BartWellingtonson,"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/17/schumers-claims-about-24-days-before-you-can-inspect-in-iran/

>First, there’s a 14-day period for negotiations. If nothing is resolved, the matter is brought to a Joint Commission under which five of eight members could force Iran to open the facility to inspectors. (The members of the commission are representatives of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, European Union, China, Russia and Iran.) There’s a seven-day limit on Joint Commission consultations. If the Joint Commission orders Iran to open the facility, Iran has three days to comply—or face a “snapback” of sanctions (a process that would begin at the U.N. Security Council). The process is supposed to remain in place for 15 years.

>Add it up—14 plus 7 plus 3—and you get 24 days. But that’s the maximum, not the minimum...

My opinion: There is no way a guy as smart as Ted Cruz doesn't understand this. He is willfully misinforming the public to further his political campaign.
