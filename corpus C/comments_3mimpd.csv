We have put them in that corner, and while their actions are not noble, it is understandable. The U.S could easily be in Russia's position had we lost the cold war and Europe switched sides. When talking about Russia, even though I am an American, I must remain as unbiased as possible.

Anyway, giving the reins to Russia in this kind of endeavor will ultimately lead into some kind of power grab by Russia, yes, but it would also foster good relations with Assad, Russia AND China.",2,0,1443408084,1444723273

BTW I understand the hippocresy of this argument seeing as we overthrew many democracies in favor of pro US dictatorships over the years, mostly to shitty results. My bigger concern here is that we wnd up with a germany at the end of WW2 except without allied presence, so instead of a split state we just basically give syria to Putin on a silver platter",1,0,1443414364,1444723273

cvfiac4,1,t3_3mimpd,Dark-Ulfberht,"This is what our strategy should be in general, with our response to ISIS being a microcosm.

1. Largely pull out of world affairs.  Maintain sufficient presence to secure existing bases, but provide zero assistance for any nation should it come under stress.

2. Invest the capital that is conserved from Item 1 in technological and infrastructure development in the US.  Some of this should be allocated for pushing our military even further ahead of the rest of the world.  If you want a vision for the goal, it looks something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPn6kK0r718).

3. As we focus on our own development, let the world fall to shit.  Let the Middle East collapse.  Stand aside as millions of migrants flood into Europe causing nationalist tensions to divide that continent as it did a century ago.  Stand aside as Russia takes advantage of the situation.  Focus on ourselves; leave everyone else in the dirt.  If these countries ask for our help, remind them of their criticism of American hegemony and turn our backs.

4. After some time has passed, when the chaos has spread to every corner of the planet, return to assist.  Tell every nation who requires assistance that it comes at a price.  When we come to provide stability, that nation's lands and resources shall become the property of the U.S. government, to dispense with as it pleases.  Provincial leaders shall be appointed from our military and state department to rule; local officials shall serve in an advisory role.

5. Deploy our forces in full combat posture.  Do not deploy for COIN.  Crush all resistance.  If a town is a hot spot of insurgent activity, give them 72 hours to deliver all insurgents.  If this is not done, seize the town and use the Roman principle of decimation for every male over the age of 16.  Repeat as necessary until security is restored.

6. Remain in effective control of all nations which required our forces to pacify insurgencies for 100 years.  Import American culture through business, media, and academic institutions.

7. Enjoy PAX Americana.  If you *really* want peace, this is what it will take.  Everything else is ultimately just going to kick the can down the road, with varying degrees of success.",-2,0,1443327953,1444723273

This. 

Iraq has already proven that they cannot handle this themselves and will probably fail at the end like South Vietnam against the North Vietnamese.
