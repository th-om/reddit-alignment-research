This Act seems valuable, as it incentives the manufacture of drugs that otherwise would not be cost-effective for the private sector to manufacture, but they need to amend it to put in some gouging safeguards.

Claims its an orphan drug due to its limited demand. That's not really how it works.

Says it is quintessentially an orphan drug, not that it is, but it works like one due to low demand. Again, not really how it works. 

Now, this [FDA website](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/OOPD_Results_2.cfm?Index_Number=232206) shows that it  pyrimethamine does not have orphan drug status. Pyrimethamine is the active in Daraprim (daraprim did not give any results in search). 

Orphan drug status confers on the developer certain tax advantages in order to promote the development of a drug to treat certain rare diseases. This drug was already developed prior to the orphan drug act and any tax advantages allowed it by having orphan drug status is nil, at this time.

No.  It says it is a quintessential orphan drug.  Quintessential means,

So both sources say it is an orphan drug.  You are also under misconceptions about the act in question. It gives the fda power to confer orphan status on any drug meeting the criteria.  It doesn't matter when that drug was created.

Orphan Designation Status simply means that the developer has requested Orphan drug designation from the FDA. It does not mean it has been approved, it just means the company has requested it. The approval in indicated in the FDA Orphan Approval Status.

Where are you getting that?  The difference seems to be something else,

Daraprim is manufactured by Turing. ExSAR Corp (link sends to Zywie Bio site). 

Zywie Bio used daraprim in a clinical trial as a pharmacological chaperone, in combination with its proprietary drug in a single clinical trial. Zywie does not manufacture or sell Daraprim on its own. Part of applying for a clinical trial is filing an IND with the FDA. Part of that IND is applying for Orphan Drug Status for the product (it sets up the eventual orphan drug designation at time of commercialization). Again, the link you provided is for a clinical trial, not a commercial product. Big difference.

For the sake of argument, if daraprim is an orphan drug, as you suggest, what does Turing get out of it's orphan drug designation?

Well, I'm actually trying to understand this because it has been reported as an orphan drug by most major new agencies.  

>Again, the link you provided is for a clinical trial, not a commercial product. Big difference.

Where are you getting the distinction between an Orphan Designation Status and an FDA Orphan Approval Status?  I really don't think it means that it is under review, since it wouldn't have the designation yet in that case.

and this statement is false. It has market exclusivity through distribution chain restriction. It has no enhanced patent protection since it is no longer under patent. You say it above that it was under patent until the 70's. If a generic wanted to market daraprim in the US all it has to do is file an application and await FDA approval. No company has done that in the past because the market for it is so small that the return on investment would not make it financially viable to apply in US. 

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_Drug_Act_of_1983#Regulatory_harmonization

This has nothing to do with the current topic. All it is saying is that US and EU (largest markets for drugs) will use the same application formats. It even says that approval is still separate between US and EU, therefore any orphan status designated in EU may not be applicable to US and vice versa. 

Finally [Orphan Designation Status](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions/HowtoapplyforOrphanProductDesignation/ucm364750.htm) is for the FDA to designate a drug treats a specific rare disease. This is done before a submission is made for approval. It sets in place the process for assigning orphan drug status BUT does NOT infer orphan status. The drug must still be approved by FDA. This is the difference between designation and approval status. So for the last time (I hope) [Daraprim](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/OOPD_Results_2.cfm?Index_Number=232206) is NOT an Orphan drug as its orphan approval status is

tl;dr, the FDA doesnt take your word for it that your drug is the same as that other guys, and the other guy actively closes access to samples to prove yours is the same.


Basically, each drug put on the market has to be FDA approved, even a generic, so a company buys up the rights to sell or market the currently approved drug version, getting another version approved is possible, but its not cheap or fast, the result is a temporary **government created** monopoly on a drug.

Any company can get another version of the drug approved for sale, they just have to prove that their drug is pretty much the same (I think the word is ""biocompatible"" but I have closed the tab). To prevent that the usurious company restricts access to the old drug, usually by claiming it is dangerous (it sometimes is) making it impossible for a company to get a sample legally to take to the FDA in order to prove their drug is just a similar version.


So, the real issue is a company using government regulation to grant itself a monopoly, its an example of the ills of regulation, not the need for it.",1,0,1443573865,1444721954
