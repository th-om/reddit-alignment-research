cvebsur,1,t3_3mehky,jellicle,The U.S. already takes fingerprints from all immigrants.,16,0,1443225301,1444723520
cveqos6,0,t1_cvebsur,pokll,"I got fingerprinted coming into South Korea. It's really not a big deal one way or another, the question is how they put the information to use. ",1,0,1443271886,1444723520
cveby1g,0,t1_cvebsur,BartWellingtonson,But what about the find-the-visa-overstayers part? How does having fingerprints solve that problem? Isn't Christy really advocating for fingerprints of all people in the US that and scanners in every government building? Isn't that the only way to catch visa overstayers with fingerprints? ,3,0,1443225592,1444723520
cvec7sj,0,t1_cveby1g,jellicle,"I suppose.  Perhaps roving patrols can randomly fingerprint people walking down the street to catch the terrorists.... I mean, immigrants.",4,0,1443226140,1444723520
cven3d7,0,t1_cvec7sj,kingvitaman,How would they choose who to randomly fingerprint though? Ohhh yeah. Just pick brown people. I'm sure that will work out well. ,3,0,1443255764,1444723520

cvelhrp,0,t1_cveby1g,revee,"First, the US already finger prints everyone, even when you have nothing but a connecting flight in the US, you get fingerprinted (say you are flying Canada -> Mexico with a layover in Chicago and you don't want into the US at all - you are giving prints).

Second... It could be doable. You would have to start checking prints of people doing a random activity somewhere, make it a part of... say... going to the post office, Govt buildings, traffic stops etc. I am not advocating for it, btw, just thinking out loud.

Also, Trump has a similar idea, he said, knowing that we have the prints, how there needs to be a ""way to tap on their shoulder, tell them they have been here long enough and that they need to go back"". That was in connection with the fact that many if not most illegal immigrants get here legally and overstay.",2,0,1443249046,1444723524
cvejqmn,1,t3_3mehky,DevonWeeks,"Fingerprints are logged into the NCIC database and would immediately alert law enforcement to a subject's identity should they commit a crime and get arrested.  Right now, many illegal immigrants have no ID and will give you a false name if you arrest them.  With the fingerprints, you simply run them and send the digital record to NCIC.  Within minutes, you know who that person is and what their criminal history is.  It's actually a good idea from an enforcement perspective.  ",3,0,1443243291,1444723528
cveqm4r,0,t1_cvejqmn,arthurpaliden,So if it is that good of an idea the do it for all the citizens as well.,2,0,1443271640,1444723528
cveskw5,0,t1_cveqm4r,DevonWeeks,"Well, we do already do it for a very large portion of the population.  All federal employees have it done.  All state employees have it done. Anyone who holds any licensure or bond from a state department of insurance (security guards, locksmiths, bail bondsmen, etc.) has it done.  All educators public or private have it done.  I mean, we're talking about a huge number of people who already have this done, probably half the workforce or more.  I wouldn't be that difficult to do it with everyone, though with most people other records serve the same purpose, like dental records in death identification for example.  It's a very small number of people we don't already have some biological identifier on file for. ",2,0,1443276977,1444723528
cvf0syi,1,t3_3mehky,samtravis,The narrative right now is that all immigrants are criminals who rape and murder their way to wealth via welfare checks and food stamps as soon as they sneak across the border.  This plan would allow us to track their individual sprees more accurately.,2,0,1443292873,1444723528

cvet8k6,1,t3_3mehky,mathurin1911,"Yeah, stuff like this is why I am for an effective barrier on our border, the only other option for controlling immigration is big brother tracking stuff

cvee8a7,1,t3_3mehky,mrmoustache8765,No one's talking about Christie period. Bridge-gate and his terrible performance as governor of New Jersey will ensure that he'll never get close to the nomination. ,1,0,1443230312,1444723532

cvebxsw,1,t3_3mehky,Big_sumo,"It's simply his attempt to raise his standing by appealing to the xenophobic crowd.  He was a US attorney and he knows we already do this.  Just like Jeb routinely speaks spanish and celebrates latin culture but is now saying he hates multiculturalism. Rubio was for a pathway to citizenship but now said he will never ever support it as president.   In order to appeal to the Trump xenophobia, the candidates are saying things they don't mean.",2,0,1443225579,1444723536

cvecxfu,0,t1_cvec0ve,Big_sumo,the idea is that if they are arrested they will be identified and ICE called.  That's how it already is though. ,6,0,1443227579,1444723536
cveec2a,0,t1_cvecxfu,BartWellingtonson,Are fingerprints necessary to identify someone as illegal? I guess I just can't believe that anyone thinks this is a solution to anything.,0,0,1443230532,1444723536
