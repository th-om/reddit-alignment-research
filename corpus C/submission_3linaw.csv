3linaw,Scientists Ask Obama To Prosecute Global Warming Skeptics,86,atomicpete,"From a letter written by 20 leading Climate Scientists to Obama: 

""We appreciate that you are making aggressive and imaginative use of the limited tools available
to you in the face of a recalcitrant Congress. One additional tool – recently proposed by Senator
Sheldon Whitehouse – is a RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act)
investigation of corporations and other organizations that have knowingly deceived the
American people about the risks of climate change, as a means to forestall America’s response to
climate change.""
