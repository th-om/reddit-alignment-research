There were slightly less politicized shutdowns earlier on.

They wouldn't have the votes in Congress.  You have to have the votes in Congress to pass a budget first.  You seem to be making strawman arguments.

Depends on how you look at it.

I mean, Clinton's two shutdowns were both based on his refusal to sign budgets or CR that passed both houses of Congress. If Obama vetoes one that passes both Houses here, it will be the same thing.


Also, Clinton and HW's shutdowns were pretty similar in nature to Reagan's.

The teachers unions would certainly put up a stink, but not one worth shutting down the government over.  Those concerned with First amendment violations would probably prefer to challenge the issue in the courts in order to establish precedent.

Again, there is no obligation for the government to give grants to PP. None at all. By default, it is not funded. PP has to explicitly request and get funding approved.
