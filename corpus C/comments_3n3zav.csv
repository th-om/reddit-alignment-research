What can we do to ensure that our impact is minimized and that in the future we can be adaptable to whatever this planet decides to throw at us.""

Personally, I don't subscribe to a human-caused climate change disaster. I think that this isn't as abnormal of climate changing as we think it is, and that we might not be able to do anything other than let the earth run its course and continue with its own cycles. I've seen enough of this world to know that humans honestly can barely put a dent in this old lump of space rock. However, our actions and behavior are making this place uninhabitable for us, and if we don't find a way to make our way of life more sustainable then we're doomed.

cvksdlz,0,t1_cvklwrx,cantletthatstand,">do you think the same is true with republicans and government?

Yes, but to a lesser degree.  Insofar as my realistic choices are between the Republicans and the Democrats, I would say that if ""being able to profit off of work"" and ""being able to have the final say on what happens to one's private property"" go, the Republicans are better choices than the Democrats by a country mile. 

Neither party is particularly GOOD on upholding private property rights, but I think the Republicans attempt to come up with solutions that at least have SOME basic respect for the concept, while the Democrats virtually always demonize economic freedom/private property and insist that the only reasonable solution is to nationalize or in some way drastically expand government authority.  There are areas that the Republicans are worse than the Democrats (voluntary euthanasia, abortion, drug policy), but I think that wealth combined with de-clawing the state is a much better approach for every working person.

>i'm also curious what your basis is for this.

Well, the bogus ""deregulation caused the Financial Crisis"" narrative, maintained by blatantly partisan tactics (financial crisis affects all Americans regardless of political affiliation, Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission initiated to study financial crisis comprised of six Democrats and four Republicans) and upheld by a highly liberal media and highly liberal academia.  Dissent from this narrative has been granted no airtime, despite very good arguments that yes, the government *was* distorting incentives in an *immensely* perverse fashion.

The push to increase taxes on the wealthy.

The continuing rhetoric on income inequality.

The recent demonization of pharmaceutical companies who raise the prices of their drugs.

The recent passage of Net Neutrality regulations.

In my opinion, economic freedom is our ticket to prosperity.  It isn't perfect.  It isn't going to lift EVERY poor person out of poverty, but at the same time, I don't accept the left-wing narrative that 98% of poor people are innocent paragons of hard work who have just been slighted by ""the system.""
