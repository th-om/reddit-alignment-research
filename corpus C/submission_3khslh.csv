3khslh,Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders: Social Democrat or Democratic Socialist? And does it matter?,25,unphilievable,"Simply put, social democrats aim to work within the democratic system to further the causes of social justice and equal economic opportunityâ€” their primary goal is often referred to as a firm economic ""safety net"" for all, which would work alongside a meritocracy and the market system, not replace it. Democratic socialism can be used as a more general term, but simply refers to a socialist economy that is also democratic (as opposed to Soviet-style dictatorship). Bernie Sanders has repeatedly referred to himself as a democratic socialist, yet his proposed policies and platform are (as I understand them) best described as those of a social democrat. I can't help but wonder every time I hear it whether he truly means democratic socialism or is just using the wrong phrase. Am I missing something about either term or Mr. Sanders' policies? Does any of this make a real difference?
