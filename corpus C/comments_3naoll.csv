He politicized it because that's how you fucking solve a problem like this. He has had this happen, what, 14 times since he came into office? This is uniquely an American problem, so he's trying to solve it, so he doesn't have to make another address like this. Crying every time it happens is bullshit and doesn't solve anything.

cvmnrq7,1,t3_3naoll,Snedeker,"I think that there are very few people who are ""suited"" to making a speech like that. The question would be who could rise to the occasion and pull it off. 

George Bush was certainly not known for making good speeches. He always came across as  nervous and twitchy, with a tendency to smirk. But he managed to rise to the occasion, as I'm sure most of the candidates would. 

It's probably easier to point out people who I think wouldn't be able to do it. Looking back a few years, John Kerry would have been miserable at it. His first instinct would have been to make a boring lecture. 

Of the current candidates, I think that Hillary would probably have the hardest time. She always seems to have her ""shields"" up, and has a very hard time coming across as genuine. If she made such a speech it would probably have been run through a dozen focus groups first, and have subsections included to advance some favorite policy she wanted to pass.

The only other one I think think would have a hard time making a ""Pull the country together"" speech is Obama. He could make a great speech that his supporters would love, but he would not be able to resist including at least some element of attacking his political opponents. He does this almost every time, no matter what the topic.",0,0,1443873069,1444720041
