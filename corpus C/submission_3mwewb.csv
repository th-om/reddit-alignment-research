3mwewb,Is it morally reprehensible for the government to profit from student loans?,128,brianwantsblood,"EDIT: Maybe ""reprehensible"" is too strong a word, so let's just go with ""morally wrong.""

---

More so, would it make more sense for the government to simply pick up the tab of tuition fees, freeing millions from debt, which in turn could theoretically boost the economy (less debt = more money to spend and put back into the economy)? I know it's much more complicated than that, and I'm not sure exactly of all the specifics. If you have more insight I'd love to hear it, as I'm trying to figure this stuff out.

I'm currently a student, and I'm actually lucky enough to have enough in scholarships and grants that I actually get paid to go to college. While I'll gladly take all the money I'm getting, in the back of my mind it does seem a little weird that our system is so screwed up that I'm getting refunded money by the government, while the majority of students are drowning in debt.
