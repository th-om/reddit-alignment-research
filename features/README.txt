This folder contains lists of function words that can be used as 
"coordination markers". The categories are those used by 
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2012).
(http://www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/Echoes_of_power.html)

However, while Danescu-Niculeascu-Mizil and colleagues use the 
markers provided by the commercial text analysis software LIWC 
(Pennebaker et al., 2007), the lists here are compiled using 
freely available frequency lists of part-of-speech classes from 
the British National Corpus. These are the lists of markers used 
in Noble & Fernandez (2015). To compile them, we took the most 
common words for each relevant POS (manually filtering out any 
content words) to match the length of the LIWC category lists 
reported in the software documentation
(http://www.liwc.net/descriptiontable1.php).
