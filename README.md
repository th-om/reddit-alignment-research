# Reddit alignment research project

This is a student project, developed for the course Computational Pragmatics at the University of Amsterdam in 2015.

The aim of the project was investigating the influence of linguistic alignment on Reddit comment ratings. Parts of the code can also be used for other research on the provided corpus or a newly generated one.

This repository contains:
* corpusdownloader.py: generates a new corpus from any chosen subreddit
* corpusreader.py: module which can be used to read from the corpus
* generate_results.py: generated our results
* regression.py: performs regression analysis on our results
* helpers.py: provides some helper functions
* corpus C: the corpus we've used, with 519 submissions + 34767 comments

We provide this code and the corpus under the MIT License. Feel free to use it for your own Reddit research.
